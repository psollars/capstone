You can also calculate\n","probability of any sequence being generated by the Markov chain as long as you know the initial\n","probabilities and the transition probabilities. But problem is that if you are new to sequence\n","modeling, if you have a new set of data, you actually don't know the probabilities. It's not hard to\n","find how many states there are, basically you count how many words there are in your vocabulary, or\n","how many items there are in a DNA sequence. But you don't know the initial probabilities or the\n","transition probabilities, we need to estimate them from data.

What is the\n","probability that we will see one word as the first word? You'd have a partial sequence or a complete\n","sequence. For complete sequences, If we only care about generating complete sequences, if we never\n","try to generate a partial sequence, then we can always consider S, the start of the sequence as a\n","word. In that case, the initial probability will have the one value for S, and they're value for any\n","other states or any other words. If we do care about partial sequences, then we have to assign\n","probabilities to any of the real words. In that case, we need to calculate Pw. A Pw_i can be easily\n","calculated in the same way as we estimate the unigram language models. Basically, we count how many\n","times that the word w_i appear in any of the sequences that you have observed, and we normalize that\n","by the total number of words. Suppose we start anywhere in the sequence, how likely that we will be\n","looking at the word w_i. This is how to estimate initial probabilities. How do we estimate\n","transition probabilities? You can see that because every word depends on the previous word. We have\n","Pw_ j given w_i. That means we need to estimate the probabilities of all these pairs of dependency\n","structure. If we only care about the complete sequences, we can just add another state, E as the end\n","of the sequence. The easy way to treat that is to consider the end of the sequence E as yet another\n","word.\n","\n","{\n","    \"source\": \"03_markov-chain-part-3.en.txt\",\n","    \"course_number\": \"SIADS 632\",\n","    \"course_title\": \"Data Mining II\",\n","    \"start_index\": 0\n","}\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Everything will be the same. How to estimate the probability of w_j given w_i? Well, basically, all\n","we need to do is to count how many times then the bigram w_i w_j has appeared in all the sequences.\n","Why? Because the conditional probabilities of w_j given w_i depends on how many times then w_j\n","appears following w_i. We need to put the count of the bigram w_j to the top of the bar. Then we\n","divide that count by what? By how many times that we observe any bigram with w_i as the first word.\n","You can see that after this normalization, the conditional probabilities of any word w_j, given a\n","particular w_i, will what? Will sum to one. In other words, the sum of the counts we have below the\n","bar is essentially the count of w_i itself. Suppose we consider n over sequence also as the word,\n","then how times that we see any word or any of the sequence following w_i is essentially how many\n","times that we see the word w_i. This becomes simple. Basically, to estimate the transition\n","probabilities from one word to another, all we need to do is to count how many times that both words\n","appear in order next to each other. We normalize that by the count of the first word. We could do\n","that for initial probabilities too.\n","\n","{\n","    \"source\": \"03_markov-chain-part-3.en.txt\",\n","    \"course_number\": \"SIADS 632\",\n","    \"course_title\": \"Data Mining II\",\n","    \"start_index\": -1\n","}\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","How so? Remember that if we care about complete sequences, we always have SSS state. If we care\n","about partial sequences, we need to see how likely that one word is used as the first word in a\n","sequence. We can do this in general by only considering S as the stating state, but we do consider\n","w_j, given S as the transition probability from S. Does that make sense? This is essentially the\n","same with what we have seen with the DNA example. This conditional probability can be calculated as\n","the count of how many times that w_j is the first word of a sequence, normalized by how many\n","sequences you have, or how many sequence starts. Basically, this is how many sequences you have.\n","This is how to estimate the initial probabilities and the transition probabilities of a Markov\n","chain. You have to do that when you have data, you have to do that when you have observed many\n","sequences or many sentences to give you a summary of the Markov chain and its relation to the chain\n","rule and unigram language models. You can see that based on a Markov chain, we're basically making\n","different independence assumptions to the chain rule. Remember that in a chain rule, which is\n","guaranteed to be right, we're calculating the probability of a run sequence as the probability of\n","the words one by one, give what? Given all its previous words. But in reality, this calculation can\n","be very hard because in this case we have to estimate all these conditional probabilities from data.\n","We see that this chain rule is always true because there's no independence assumption, every word is\n","depending on everything in front of it. Now, we can add in some independence assumptions to make\n","this form easier for calculation and easier for understanding. Well, you could assume that this\n","complete independence, that says the probability of one word. Although in the chain rule it says\n","that it depends on every word in front of it, now we can see that it does not. It depends on\n","nothing. That's also to say that the probability of one word is completely independent to any other\n","words in the sequence. In this case, we call it the unigram language model, and it assumes complete\n","independence. This is a unigram model. To move from there, we can see that this assumption is too\n","strong because when we are writing the words, we always depend on some previous words. Probably, not\n","the previous 100 or 1,000 words, but at least the previous one or two words. In between no\n","independence and compete independence, we actually have a big space called partial independence. For\n","example, the Markov chain assumes that the probability of writing down any word wk, given all its\n","previous words, can be simplified as the collision probability of wk only depending on its previous\n","one word. If this is true, then we say the Markov assumption is true. This is, you can see, partial\n","independence. Wk is dependent on the previous words, but it's not dependent on everything. Its\n","neither no independence or complete independence. A Markov chain model, because we care about both\n","wk and wk minus 1, it's also called the bigram model. Well, you may say that what if we play around\n","in the space that we assume that the generation of one word, does not only depend on the previous\n","one word, it depends on previous two words. I could do that. I could also say that, it depends on\n","the previous three words.

And the really neat thing about by plots is they show you both the\n","transformed data. What happens to the data after you transform it into PCA feature space? And it\n","also shows you the relationships between the principle components and between the principle\n","components and the data. So it's incredibly useful tool to explore a data set that you've analyzed\n","with PCA. But it's also really good to look at by plots just because they're very useful. Practice\n","in applying the concepts from PCA to understand the structure and data first. Let's do a quick\n","review of the linear algebra basis for PCA. Remember that our goal for PCA is to compute a new set\n","of features that we derive from the old features by taking linear combinations of the columns in the\n","original data set. And so we want to choose this set of features in a way that preserves information\n","about variance in the original data set. But also does so more efficiently than the original\n","features that we want to essentially compress the data set into this sort of smaller set of\n","features. That we can use for a more parsimonious representation. So what is a linear combination?\n","It simply a weighted sum of things and I'm going to note here the linear combination vector, a. I'm\n","going to put it at the top here so the idea is that we're going to be taking linear combinations of\n","columns of X. So for example, if X had three columns, then a might contain point 3.3, 3.5 and 0.2.\n","So we would be a vector if there were three columns in X, then a would have three elements. Real\n","numbers corresponding to the weights that each column was given in the linear combination, of\n","course. There could be a negative element of a as well. And so another way to think about this. If\n","you look at the product of matrix X with this vector, a. You can think of a as a vector. It is a\n","vector and you can think of this operation of multiplication like projection. So if X consists of\n","these data points, drawing little data points here. When we multiply X by a, you can think of this\n","kind of as a projection of all the data points onto a. And what's the result of the projection we've\n","taken the data points. And each data point now corresponds to a real number on this line.\n","Corresponding to its location on the line described by a. And so, in our search for this new set of\n","features that will be a more compressed representation of our data. We want a vector, a, as we\n","discussed in formulating PCA earlier. The vector, a, should maximize in some sense have a maximal\n","variance. So if you think back to that example with the scatter plot, the elliptical scatter plot.\n","The first principle component found the direction of maximum variance of the data, and that's all\n","this criterion is saying right here. That whatever vector, a, this linear combination of columns is,\n","it should. Whatever the variance of that projection is, this projection Xa. That variance should be\n","maximum. So anyway, the PCA algorithm will go ahead, it'll chug along, it will find and a that\n","satisfies that criterion, as well as the second criterion. So to constrain the family of solutions\n","that the norm of a has to be 1. So we will go ahead and it will find a vector, a, will call this\n","solution vector a1. And that solution vector a1 will be a vector like this, it will be a set of\n","weights, one weight per column and it will create a new feature. So the linear combination of those\n","columns of the original data set X according to the weights in a1 will produce a set of these values\n","that are essentially new feature values for each data instance. And PCA is an iterative process, so\n","after it finds the first solution a1, we ask it okay now find another vector that has the second\n","highest variance as a result of applying it to the data. And so on, so we'll get a series of\n","solutions, to this optimization problem. And each of the values in these ai these vectors, is called\n","the loading, so that linear combination is just a linear combination of weights. The weights are\n","called loadings in much of the statistical literature. And the result of applying those loadings on\n","x, are called the scores. So essentially the scores of the thing that appear in the new feature\n","space, it's what happens to the original values of x, you transform them into these new feature\n","space, these ai features that you found. It just basically says what happens to x, what are the\n","coordinates of x in that new feature space spanned by that the aI's? Now when we run PCA, the\n","loadings on the scores are available to us after we fit the model. So if you see down here in Scikit\n","learn, we first take our normalized original data set, run the fit method and that goes ahead and\n","does that process of finding these solution vectors a1, a2 and so forth. And then to get the scores,\n","you just simply call once this PCA has been fit, you call transform on your data. And so this this\n","x_pca what I've called x_pca here those, essentially are the results of applying the data projecting\n","the data onto the principle components. So these are the scores, so the scores come out of the\n","transform method. And then to get the solutions themselves that were found by PCA, you can use this\n","property of PCA that is set once it's been fit, components_, make sure you don't forget the\n","underscore, it's often easy thing to overlook. But pcacomponents_ has its columns that contain a1\n","and a2 and so forth. So we have the scores that are essentially the transformed data in the a1, a2\n","and so forth feature space, and we have the loadings, which are the values in each of the ai. And\n","what biplots are going to do is, they're going to show us both the scores and the loadings in one\n","plot. Let's go back for a minute to the PCA example on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. So you\n","might recall that this data set represents a set of measurements of cell images, and there were,\n","what? 30 some odd features which you can see over here, they actually had an imaging tool like the\n","one on the left to help staff derive the set of features. So it helped measure distances and sizes\n","and dimensions and so forth of these cells on the image. So they have an imaging tool and the output\n","of the imaging tool, with this set of features that came out. Now if we want to find out which of\n","these features are correlated with each other, we can get that information very nicely with a\n","biplot, so in this example what we've done is we've taken the original 30 some odd features an run a\n","principal components analysis with two principle components. So again, think of a principle\n","component like corresponding to a new feature.\n","\n","{\n","    \"course_number\": \"SIADS 543\",\n","    \"course_title\": \"Unsupervised Learning\",\n","    \"source\": \"05_pca-biplots-and-how-to-use-them.en.txt\",\n","    \"start_index\": -1\n","}\n","\n","Similarity Score: 0.7531818151473999\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","You declare an object of the PCA class, right.
