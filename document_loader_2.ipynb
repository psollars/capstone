Thus, you must \"pass\" ALL Assignments AND Quizzes to receive credit for this\n","course. What does this mean? You \"pass\" an assignment or quiz by getting a minimum grade of 80%\n","regardless of whatever late penalty might also apply. If by the end of the course you have any\n","assignments or quizzes that you did not \"pass\", you will be given a course grade of \"incomplete\"\n","until you submit those remaining assignments or quizzes to the level of a \"pass\". Example: You hand\n","in Assignment 3 but only get a grade of 60%, which is less than 80% and thus not a \"pass\". You\n","continue in the course, and to meet the above \"pass\" course requirement, a week later you finish the\n","questions and achieve a score of 90% (ignoring late penalty) for Assignment 3. Thus, you now have a\n","\"pass\" for Assignment 3. Your actual grade for Assignment 3 will be evaluated by the normal grading\n","/ late penalty scheme. In this case, it will be 60% (the maximum of your submission grades with late\n","penalty included), not the 90% grade used to satisfy the \"pass\" criterion (which ignores the late\n","penalty).  | Course Item                        | Percentage of Final Grade | Passing Threshold | |\n","---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | | Week 1 Quiz\n","| 5%                        | 80%               |\n","\n","{\n","    \"source\": \"543_2023-09.md\",\n","    \"heading\": \"Grading And Course Checklist\",\n","    \"section\": \"24\",\n","    \"course_number\": \"SIADS 543\",\n","    \"course_title\": \"Unsupervised Learning\",\n","    \"course_date\": \"September 2023\",\n","    \"document\": \"https://www.si.umich.edu/sites/default/files/543%20_0.pdf\"\n","}\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Late Submission Policy: Important! Please read and understand\n","this section, and if anything is unclear, the instructors are happy to clarify. We realize that, now\n","more than ever, the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra\n","time in completing a course assignment or quiz. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy\n","that gives you a limited number of flexible \"late day\" credits. You have a total of two (2) free\n","late days to use during the course. One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due\n","date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. As an\n","example, suppose you had two course late days left. Submitting any time within 24hrs of the original\n","due date counts as using the first late day. Beyond that time, submitting any time within the next\n","24h counts as using the 2nd late day. After that, each additional 24h period accrues a 25% per day\n","penalty as follows: Once you have used up your late days, there is a 25% penalty for each subsequent\n","24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late. For example, if the due date is 11:59\n","p.m. ET, Monday, and you have _no_ late days left, penalties would be: Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET\n","Tuesday: 25% deduction Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday: 50% deduction Submit before 11:59 p.m.\n","ET Thursday: 75% deduction Submit after 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 100% deduction If you were to have\n","one late day at the end of the term the submission policy would be as follows: Submit before 11:59\n","p.m. ET Wednesday: 25% deduction Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 50% deduction ... and so on\n","as above. Important: You do not need to explain or get permission to use late days. If you\n","choose/need to use the available late days for a week's work, you will be responsible for\n","designating which week(s) you wish to have the late day(s) applied. Your choice could impact your\n","final course grade due to the assignment weighting described in the Grading and Course Checklist\n","section above. Upon completion of all assignments, please _Slack DM the course Instructor and\n","Lecturer(s)_ (combined message) with your desired application of late days. Note that any\n","submissions after the weekly deadline may be counted as a late submission for the week.

Course Basics Course Overview And Prerequisites: This class will\n","teach you to recognize where ethical issues can arise when applying data science to real world\n","problems. It will bring more analytic precision to ethical debates about the role that data science,\n","machine learning, and artificial intelligence play in consequential decision-making in commerce,\n","employment, finance, healthcare, education, policing, and other areas. Largely through discussions\n","of case studies, we will focus on ways to conceptualize, measure, and mitigate harm in data-driven\n","decision-making. You will learn to think critically about how to plan and evaluate a data science\n","project with ethical concerns in mind, and how to cope with novel challenges for which there are\n","often no easy answers or established solutions.  To do so, you will learn key technical, ethical,\n","policy, and legal terms and concepts that are relevant to ethical assessment in data science; learn\n","about some of the common approaches and emerging tools for mitigating or managing these ethical\n","concerns; and gain exposure to readings that will help you understand the current ethical and\n","regulatory environment and to anticipate future developments. Ultimately, the class will teach you\n","how to reason through these problems in a systematic manner and how to justify and defend your\n","approach to dealing with them.  The prerequisites for this course are admission into the Masters in\n","Applied Data Science program and successful completion of SIADS 501, \"Being a Data Scientist.\"\n","\n","{\n","    \"source\": \"503_2023-11.md\",\n","    \"heading\": \"I.

The course will also introduce\n","techniques for visualizing specific data types: temporal, network, hierarchical, and text.\n","Information visualization is a crucial step in both understanding and communicating data. In the\n","first Information Visualization course we focused on the fundamental principles behind visualization\n","--the most basic types of data, encodings, and the perceptual and cognitive processes that make some\n","visualizations better than others. This class will expand on these basic principles to include\n","interactivity. We will see how interactivity can act as a boost to expressiveness and effectiveness\n","by studying a handful of common cross-cutting techniques. The class will also expand on the basic\n","data types to feature techniques for visualizing multivariate datasets, temporal data, network,\n","hierarchical, and text. We will focus on general techniques but also focus on specific real-world\n","case studies for each type. Beyond the theoretical, the course will allow students to build on their\n","Altair expertise to build more sophisticated and interactive visualizations. We will also introduce\n","other libraries as needed for the more rarified data types (e.g., NetworkX).\n","\n","{\n","    \"source\": \"622_2023-12.md\",\n","    \"heading\": \"Course Syllabus For SIADS 622:Information Visualization II Course Overview And Prerequisites\",\n","    \"section\": \"1\",\n","    \"course_number\": \"SIADS 622\",\n","    \"course_title\": \"Information Visualization II\",\n","    \"course_date\": \"December 2023\",\n","    \"document\": \"https://www.si.umich.edu/sites/default/files/622%20_0.pdf\"\n","}\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Qualitative Inquiry for Data Scientists (SIADS 601), Course Schedule: - This course begins on\n","Tuesday, September 26, 2023 and ends on Monday, October 23, 2023. - Assignment due dates vary by\n","week.

To that end, UMSI and\n","the University of Michigan expect their students to demonstrate honesty and integrity in all their\n","academic activities. As professionals in training, students assume various roles depending on their\n","coursework and activities. These include the roles of scholar/researcher, teacher, supervisor of\n","employees, representative to the public (of the University, the discipline and/or the profession),\n","and professional colleague and even the role of provider of services to clients. Therefore, students\n","are responsible for maintaining high standards of conduct while engaged in coursework, research or\n","thesis preparation, and other activities related to academics and their profession. Because students\n","take on multiple roles in multiple settings, some types of conduct are both academic and\n","professional in nature; hence, the inclusive nature of this policy. Educational training, like\n","future professional life, includes demands that might tempt some students to violate integrity\n","standards. There are pressures on students to achieve high grades, obtain financial support, meet\n","research or publication deadlines, gain recognition from the scholarly community, and secure\n","employment. Although faculty members can help students to maintain academic integrity despite these\n","pressures, each student has final responsibility for maintaining integrity in their individual\n","conduct. Finally, conduct that violates the ethical or legal standards of the University community\n","or of UMSI may result in serious consequences, including immediate disciplinary action and future\n","professional disrepute.

This may include the student’s performance in the\n","role of researcher or scholar, teacher or mentor, supervisor, service-provider or colleague. Of\n","particular note in this regard are behaviors that make the workplace hostile for colleagues,\n","supervisors or subordinates. UMSI students are expected to adhere to ethical standards in a variety\n","of work settings (e.g., offices, classrooms, and laboratories) within the explicit standards set by\n","University policies. Language or behavior that is threatening, disruptive, abusive or hostile can\n","make the workplace so unsafe or unpleasant that others cannot do their work.
