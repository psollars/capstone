The process of collecting data in qualitative research is often more important than the actual data itself. This is because it allows for a deeper understanding of the subject matter being studied.\\nQualitative researchers often use interviews or focus groups as their primary method for collecting data. These methods allow for in-depth conversations with participants which can provide valuable insights into their thoughts and feelings about a particular topic or issue. Additionally, these methods allow for open-ended questions which allow participants to share their experiences in their own words rather than having them respond to predetermined questions set by the researcher. This allows for more nuanced understanding of complex issues than would be possible through traditional survey methods such as questionnaires or polls which only provide binary answers (yes/no).\\nQualitative researchers often use multiple methods when conducting their studies in order to get as much information as possible about their subject matter before drawing any conclusions about it based solely on quantitative evidence alone (e.g., survey results). For example, they may use both interviews and focus groups in order to get different perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied; this helps them understand how different groups view things differently from one another which could lead them down different paths when trying to solve problems related to said issue or topic being studied by them respectively..\\nWhat are the strengths of Qualitative Inquiry?\\nWhat are the strengths of Qualitative Inquiry? The strengths of qualitative inquiry are its ability to provide in-depth understanding of complex issues, its ability to capture nuanced perspectives from multiple sources, its ability to generate new insights through open-ended questions, its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an issue or topic being studied by them respectively., its ability to provide multiple perspectives from different groups within society about an'],\n"," 'ground_truth': ['\\nFinal Project Submission including:\\n    A report that tells the story of your project, which can be formatted as a blog, a scientific manuscript, or something else.\\n    A GitHub repository full of the code required to reproduce your analysis and figures, documented with an informative README.\\n    One of the following high-level overviews of your work designed to be shared:\\n    A 3-5 minute video from your team about what you made.\\n    A poster appropriate for a data science conference, such as the MIDAS Data Science Symposium.\\nWeekly Mini-Deliverables: There will be weekly mini-deliverables throughout the course, as outlined in the grading section of the syllabus.\\n',\n","  'Data Mining II, SIADS 632 includes a particular focus on time series analysis.',\n","  'The primary instructor for SQL and Databases is Graham Hukill.
