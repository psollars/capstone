How many credits are required to complete the MADS program?,34,"To earn a Master of Applied Data Science at the School of Information, you must complete a minimum of 34 credit hours of SIADS coursework, with a cumulative grade point average of a B (3.0) or better, including required coursework and electives.",handbook
How long do students have to complete the MADS program start to finish?,Five years,Students are expected to complete all coursework within five years from the date of first enrollment in the program. Students exceeding this time limit must file a petition for modification or waiver of policy. Petitions must describe explicitly the amount of work remaining and a timeline for completion. Students must be making good progress and have good academic standing to receive an extension. A student who does not complete degree requirements within five years and does not petition for an extension may be withdrawn from the program and required to apply for readmission.,handbook
