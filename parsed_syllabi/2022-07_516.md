# Learning Outcomes

Explain the relationships between MapReduce, Spark and Hadoop

Use MapReduce to sort, filter, and summarize a dataset

Use Spark RDDs to manipulate, summarize, and analyze a text-based dataset

Use Spark DataFrames to manipulate, summarize and analyze heterogeneous data

Use Spark SQL to perform complex queries on heterogeneous Big Data

# Course Schedule

- **This course begins on Tuesday, June 28, 2022 and ends on Monday, July 25, 2022.**
- Weekly assignments will be **due on Mondays at 11:59 pm** (Ann Arbor, Michigan time-Eastern Standard/Daylight Time - EDT, UTC -4).

In **Week 1** , after some discussion of how we can define Big Data,  you will be introduced to the split-apply-combine workflow common in Big-Data work. After overviewing scaling of distributed systems, week one progresses further into discussing how one can use libraries such as MapReduce, Hadoop, and MrJob for distributed solutions to big-data problems.

In **Week 2** , the course shifts focus towards introducing the Apache Spark functionality, structure, and stack. After further exploring the relationship between Spark and Hadoop, students will learn about the creation and manipulation of resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) using Spark and Python.

In **Week 3** , you will focus on working with Spark dataframes, including initialization from various file-types, column manipulation, and operations such as sorting, grouping, and user-defined functionality.

In **Week 4** , the course shifts focus to Spark's support for Structured Query Language (SQL) and explores methods available for data selection, filtration, and cross-table joining with SQL and Spark.

# Letter Grades, Course Grades, and Late Submission Policy

We realize that the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra time in completing a course assignment. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy that gives you a limited number of flexible “late day” credits.

You have three (3) free late days to use during SIADS 516. One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. Once you have used up your late days, 25% penalty for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late. For example, if the due date is 11:59pm Monday, with no late days left, penalties would be:

Before 11:59pm Tuesday: 25% deduction

Before 11:59pm Wednesday: 50% deduction

Before 11:59pm Thursday: 75% deduction

After 11:59pm Thursday: 100% deduction

You don't need to explain or get permission to use late days, and we will track them for you. Note that resubmissions after the deadline will be counted as late submissions.

The grading scale for this course is as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| A   | 95% |
| A-  | 90% |
| B+  | 87% |
| B   | 83% |
| B-  | 80% |
| C+  | 77% |
| C   | 73% |
| C-  | 70% |
| D+  | 67% |
| D   | 63% |
| D-  | 60% |
| F   | 0%  |
