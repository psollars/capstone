# Course Syllabus for SIADS 622:Information Visualization II

## Course Overview and Prerequisites

This course extends our understanding of information visualization. Leveraging the topics covered in Information Visualization I, we introduce interactive techniques that can be used broadly for visualization. The course will also introduce techniques for visualizing specific data types: temporal, network, hierarchical, and text.

Information visualization is a crucial step in both understanding and communicating data. In the first Information Visualization course we focused on the fundamental principles behind visualization--the most basic types of data, encodings, and the perceptual and cognitive processes that make some visualizations better than others. This class will expand on these basic principles to include interactivity. We will see how interactivity can act as a boost to expressiveness and effectiveness by studying a handful of common cross-cutting techniques. The class will also expand on the basic data types to feature techniques for visualizing multivariate datasets, temporal data, network, hierarchical, and text. We will focus on general techniques but also focus on specific real-world case studies for each type. Beyond the theoretical, the course will allow students to build on their Altair expertise to build more sophisticated and interactive visualizations. We will also introduce other libraries as needed for the more rarified data types (e.g., NetworkX).

_Students should have successfully completed Information Visualization I prior to enrolling in this course._

Note: All assignments are required to earn credit for this course.

Please note that instructional team may begin grading before the deadline (for assignments submitted early). Once we start grading your notebook you will not be able to revise your assignment. Be sure you are happy and done with the work whether you submit on the deadline or before.

### Letter Grades, Course Grades, and Late Submission Policy

Refer to the [MADS Assignment Submission and Grading Policies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/siads-orientation/supplement/9eHGY/mads-assignment-submission-and-grading-policies) section of the UMSI Student Handbook (access to Student Orientation course required)

For this course, assignments will be accepted 24 hours late with a 20% penalty. After 24 hours we will not accept your assignments unless you have prior approval for an extension.

Also, please note that we do not autograde in this course. We provide either an example of the output or the specific visualization for you to replicate. Because we can't autograde this (we need to look at the visualizations) this course is manually graded.

We apply the following for letter grade determination. Please note that we rarely give an A+ in this course:

| Letter Grade | Score Range |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| A            | >93         |
| A-           | 90-93       |
| B+           | 87-89       |
| B            | 83-86       |
| B-           | 80-82       |
| C+           | 77-79       |
