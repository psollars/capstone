# Course Schedule

- This course begins on **Wednesday, March 29, 2023** and ends on **Tuesday, April 25, 2023 at 11:59 p.m. EST.**
- All assignments are due at the end of the course.

  **Week 1:** Build and train multiple standard text classifiers, learn how to turn text into meaningful features, understand how hyper-parameters affect performance, and plot results for different amounts of training data to see how textual variability affects performance.

  **Week 2:** Train a word2vec model on data, compare off-the-shelf vectors with the trained vectors in a classification task, use those vectors to measure word similarity in an evaluation.

  **Week 3:** Write programs that use part of speech tagging, dependency parsing, and coreference models to extract simple information from a text corpus and analyze that information.

  **Week 4:** Train a word sense disambiguation (WSD) system using classifiers, compare performances for unsupervised and supervised WSD systems, and, train a classifier to predict social/pragmatic information from text (e.g., sarcasm)

# Technology Tips

Recommended Technology

- This program requires Jupyter Notebook for completion of problem sets and Adobe or other PDF viewer for reading articles.

Working Offline

- While the Coursera platform has an integrated Jupyter Notebook system, you can work offline on your own computer by installing Python 3.5+ and the Jupyter software packages.
