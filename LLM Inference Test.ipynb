Week 3, we switch away from Postgres and we use a\\nthing called Elasticsearch, and we spend Week 3 looking at NoSQL or non-relational\\ndatabase systems. This class isn't really all\\nabout that but I want to make sure that you understand that there are\\nmore than one choice. Relational databases\\nare really useful. There is sort of a buzz about\", metadata={'source': 'siads-611/01_welcome-to-the-course.en.txt'}),\n","  0.6399301886558533),\n"," (Document(page_content=\"talk to databases. And it's high enough and\\nabstract enough that every one of the database\\nvendors is able to build a really cool\\nimplementation and they can sort of compete with each other and build a\\nbetter implementation. So if Postgres is better than Oracle or Oracle is\\nbetter than Postgres, they can fight, they can compete. But then we simply use\\nSQL to talk to it. Now, the SQL turned\\nout to be quite early. And so there's a few extensions and we'll see those\\nthings but a lot of the core SQL is either the\\nsame or very, very similar. So the critical\\ncore bit, and we'll talk about this a\\nlot, is called CRUD. The critical notion is that\\nthere are four basic things that a system to store data is you're going to create some data\\nand put it in, you're going to pull\\nsome data back out, you're going to change data, and then you\\nmay delete data. So that's the thing\\nthat we're going to focus on making fast\\nand simple to express.

In this class, we're going\\nto teach you about Postgres. Postgres is a really\\ncool database. It's both open source, but it has a lot of features. So you might wonder why it is that we are so obsessed with\\nteaching about databases. And for those of us who've\\nbeen around a long time and started like in the\\n70s when I started, it's quite amazing how\\nfast databases are. We just use these things so much and we take them\\ncompletely for granted. When you log into a system like your learning\\nmanagement system, that system probably has 50 terabytes of data and you type your name\\nand your password, and a quarter of a second later it knows\\nwhat classes you're in, and what your notifications\\nare and all these things.
