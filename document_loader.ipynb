The form must be signed by the instructor and by the UMSI Registrar or your MADS academic\n","advisor. Then you submit the form to the U-M Registrar’s Office.  It is up to you and the faculty\n","member to agree on expectations for the audit, though typically students are expected to attend\n","class, participate, and complete assignments (and even tests), though they would receive a grade of\n","“VI” for visitor instead of receiving academic credit with a letter grade.

The purpose of this\n","policy is to make it possible for a student to maintain registered full time student status, along\n","with all the benefits of such status, while facilitating the return to full participation in\n","courses, research and teaching.  The policy applies to full time, enrolled students who are in good\n","academic standing, and making satisfactory progress toward completion of their degree. Students must\n","have completed at least one full time semester of their degree program to become eligible for\n","coverage under this policy. The policy covers the situation of students who experience childbirth or\n","the adoption of a child under the age of 6 for whom the student has parental responsibilities. These\n","eligibility requirements cover all three provisions of the policy.  The three primary accommodations\n","available are:  1. Eligible students are entitled to an extension of one year per childbirth or\n","adoption to the 5-year maximum time to degree policy. UMSI must approve requests for extension of\n","time limits. 2. All eligible students will be granted a Parental Accommodation period up to six\n","weeks long immediately following the birth of a child or the adoption of a child under the age of 6\n","for whom the student has parental responsibilities. During this period of accommodation, the student\n","will continue to be enrolled as a full time student. Because the student remains enrolled as a full\n","time student and continues to pay tuition, this is not a leave of absence. It is instead a\n","modification of deadlines and academic expectations to accommodate the student’s new parental\n","responsibilities. Students are expected to work with faculty and staff in advance of their leave to\n","develop a workable plan. 3. Students in GSRA positions are eligible to continue in their positions\n","with funding and to have modified schedules and the stated 6 weeks leave time upon birth of a child\n","or adoption of a child. The terms of employment for students with GSI or GSSA appointments are\n","covered by the contract between the University and the Graduate Employees Organization. The\n","provisions of the contract will govern stipend and benefits for these students. Students receiving\n","fellowship or scholarship funds will remain enrolled and as such these funds will not be impacted.\n","\n","{\n","    \"source\": \"handbook.md\",\n","    \"heading\": \"UMSI Student Parental Accommodation Policy\",\n","    \"section\": \"38\",\n","    \"course_number\": \"n/a\",\n","    \"course_title\": \"n/a\",\n","    \"course_date\": \"n/a\",\n","    \"document\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEOcpdONdme5kmpNEnZpdbJeVFhEIw1pS0wq16QdH1I/edit\"\n","}\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Data Mining II (SIADS 632), Weekly Office Hours Via Zoom (Ann Arbor, Michigan Time):: Your\n","instructor will hold weekly, synchronous office hours using the video-conferencing tool, Zoom.
