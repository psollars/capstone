Hello, my name is
Alexis Castellanos. This is my office
hours for Milestone 2 and today what we're
supposed to do is just have students drop in and we can answer any questions about either the comprehensive exam or about any of the projects that everyone might
be working on. It's now, 07:00 P.M. If anyone drops by, then I can answer
those questions. If not, I guess I would put myself on mute and camera off up until
those students show up. Thank you. Hey. What's this? I haven't seen you in a while. I know. How's it going? It's going great. How's
it going for you? Great. Good. How's life
after graduation? It's odd because I've been
in school my whole life, but it's nice having a
little bit more freedom. Well, good, it's awesome. How's the program going so far? Pretty good. Pretty good? Now, I'm about two-thirds
of the way in. That's pretty exciting for me. I'm learning a ton.
That's excellent. I even think I'm
learning more than I even thought that's going on. That happened to me too. I don't think I will learn that much, especially within
just one semester, I guess it's just doing a lot of it consistently
really builds on itself. I do appreciate a lot of the courses are set
up so that they give you like weekly assignments
and stuff like that, you stay on top of everything
and that's really good. I have a couple of
questions regarding, it's said on the exam prep that we could come
to office hours. Take a grim. Let me just see what it said. I can't remember exactly. Once again, I'm
just looking at it. It was something we could
work through our ideas. I was wondering if
we could do that. No problem as long as you're
not specifically giving out a full breakdown
or game plan, then we can converse
and go back and forth. I was wondering if I was going
to be giving a game plan. Maybe can we just turn off
recording and then you can tell me if this is a
okay thing to say? Sure, we can turn off recording. I'm pausing recording
just for now, and I'll turn it on
back once we're done. Thank you so much, Alexis. Hello? Hey. These office hours
just to provide for students any general
questions or answers about the comprehensive exam or
about your projects that you might be going through
my background as with natural
language processing. I'll feel free to ask away. If you don't have any questions, just I think to answer
Marianne's question, we can just do a breakout room and I can
answer your question there. I have two quick
questions about the exam. Sure. I guess you guys are already in the conversation, I joined, so sorry if this has been already answered
somewhere but I'm not really sure
whether they are alike, for the exam question three, which is on the CNNs, so on. I'm wondering, let's say
I'm relatively confident that CNNs are not a good
decision or not the best choice. The latter part of the question is worded in
a way where it feels like it's like regardless of how you feel about whether an
application of CNNs is feasible. It continues to
ask how would you design it or the
benefits and so on. How would we answer those if we answer the first part
of it more negatively. You give all the reasons why a neural net wouldn't
be a good application, even though the question
is forcing you to do so. If as long as you provide a strong statement and not only, well, this is
important everywhere, just reject an idea, but also justify it. Give a suggestion of why you would use some
other type of model. Justify why is it more suitable for the
given application. That makes sense. Thank you. My other question was for the question 8 which was
on the data scientist, if you're a data scientist working at a healthcare
company and so on. I'm just wondering, is
there a specific guideline for what is meant by
a technical issue? The technical issues
I would think,of I guess could also count
as pre-processing, like which was
like the previous. That's what I was finding
too, for number 8. Perfect. Yeah, I was finding that
too. That's a good question. Yeah, it was a great question. I also had a fun time with
it when I was a student. Well, I could easily tell you. You both of you have taken
milestones to, correct? Just picking one and then
putting it into the, deciding what was a
technical issue and what was some three pre-processing issues and then explaining everything. Is that what we should do? What exactly is the
question for that one? Because I don't have them
memorized by numbers. We recently changed them. The question is,
imagine that you are a data scientist working for
a healthcare company and your task is to develop a machine learning
model to predict which patients are at risk of developing a certain disease based on the medical records. The first part is
first describe and justify at least three
specific steps you might need to take on to
pre-process the data. Then it's a state one particular technical
issue related to the data that you need to be vigilant about and
how you may avoid it. I'm just not sure how to differentiate technical issues from the pre-processing steps. Technical issues arise when you do any of your I would say
general pre-processing. Things I would say applying some type of
balancing algorithm. That is not necessarily
a pre-processing step, but it's a technical issue. What if we have in a case where, say we have only 100
samples of class A, but we have 1,000 of class B. That's more of a technical issue that we're trying to handle. It's no longer in the
pre-processing step because the
pre-processing would just be first identifying all the
noise that's in our data, reformatting it, and identifying key features
that we're going to use. Now, something like
that is considered a technical step that
you need to take. There's other ones that you
might see within all of data. Say for something like
image processing, you don't have the
appropriate cases. A lot of times what happens
is there's too much noise. What we do is we do something
like augmentation of data. Again, it's no longer a
pre-processing step but a technical hurdle
that we're trying to resolve. Does that make sense? I think that makes sense to me. Okay. Yeah, thanks. That
was really helpful. No problem. No, I got to go back and look at my answers for that. I see. If you guys who are already
in the conversation, I guess I can pop off.
Thank you so much. No, we were done. Well, that's all I had to. Great. When you're
answering these questions, try to be as direct as possible and say if the questions
are formatted in a way where they
give you almost like bullet points just write
small paragraphs or maybe write a bullet point your
method and then explain it because that makes it a lot easier for the people
that are grading it. I'm not exactly sure
who will be grading it, but it's so that all
your answers are easily identifiable
when you can map them back and see if you can
be awarded full points. Thank you. No problem. On question Number 8 that has all of the different questions, I get your point about outlining it nicely so that you
can make sure that you can get points for every
single one of the questions but like it says like
describe one technical issue, like what if you
want to put two? Make sure that you can
describe at least one very valid and clearly
explained technical issue. You won't get any extra points for going over the question. I'm just wondering if it's like, well that technically was more pre-processing or
something like that. Then if I had like put my
second technical issue and explain them both clearly about what you're
thinking was then, like because I don't want
to like lose points if I. I understand your concern. I don't see a problem with it. As long as you just
make it very clear, like I said, make sure
you're outlining. I'm saying these are
technical issues that you could identify
in such a problem. For Question 8, especially some of
the other ones, I feel like there's
a right answer but for Question 8 it
seems like a lot and then is there a correct answer that we should be or is it more like an answer with explanation? Where we're going on that one? Majority of these questions, we're looking for the
explanation and reason, where there is no
one strict answer. It's not like mathematics. It's, this is more
of a use case, and same thing as if you were to interview
for our company. They might ask you a
question and you might not exactly fit what they were looking for but as long as
you give your logic and reasoning behind it and do
have very valid points, then you will be
awarded enough marks. That's really
helpful. Thank you. Now, there is some fundamental techniques
that we are looking for. It doesn't mean you make
up your own algorithm and say that it's better
than anything else. I think that's fair. Now, I'm just thinking it's like there's not that much specifics, like there's a lot of
specific questions for particularly Number 8 with the one that he was just talking about but it's like there's not a lot of information
about the problems and so it. I could see lots of people making different modeling
choices, for example. Just because maybe you need to state some assumptions I was. That's a great point. If
you do decide to any model, really state your assumptions upon whatever statement
you're replying to. Say, assuming this and that, and then give your reason how and just like everything else, make sure you're very
thorough and well explained with your ideas. I think that's good. With a project, this is
a little bit of a side, but with project we're not necessarily sure what
all the best methods to pick for all the
different scenarios. We're actually going to try a whole bunch of stuff just to gain experience on like with
the models, with our data. Is that not a good idea? Maybe we should be like
methodical bullet before we like. Learn by doing and I learned through trial and error just
like any other algorithm. Need a lot of examples. What I would recommend
and would be a great exercise for you and your teammates would be to identify what possible
models are the best choices. Write them down and there's also libraries that can automate
this model process for you. You can use PiCare, and that's one of the
very popular ones and you can put in your problem and maybe a small sample
of your data set, run it and it'll
train and parallel anywhere from 3-15 models, it depends what you choose. Cool. That's helpful. That will save you a lot of time because the library is optimized using C underneath
just like Numpy. If you were to use
something like sklearn to train one model, it will take you about, I think it was like
four and a half times versus the one model in PiCare. Just be aware that it does
tax your system so if you only have two or
four gigs of ram that you might run out and
that's when usually we want to resort to something like the Great Lakes
computing resources. You can just run it there and see what models
perform best. Then you can go back to your
assumptions and see, hey, were the models that I was thinking adequate
for this problem? That's how you start
learning more and be able to get better ideas of how to
approach different things. I'm so happy you said that, that makes me super
happy. The best one. That was great because
that's where we were like, what's our team
planning on doing and I think we're
going to learn a ton. We're really excited about
getting to the project. That's good. Let me just go
ahead and share the link. In case you want to check it
out you can always do that. Also if you create
your own model, I forget exactly how to do it, but you can actually
test that in parallel with the
standard models. The models they use are directly
from sklearn so they're the same ones you'll be
importing from sklearn. However, in your
report and everything, don't just upload
the PiCare pipeline and say that that's your
work and that's pretty much all you did because it's just something for
you to test and see what type of model works best and then you can
tune it yourself. I would say one of the most important things
that you need to learn, because everyone can
just do sklearn import, run a model and turn it in but it will really take
someone with some type of expertise to be able to
take base model and improve its accuracy and scores
further than the base. You guys can see my screen. First of all, go and
figure out like, this is saying like hey, probably this model is going
to be a good one to use. Say it's between decision tree and maybe logistical
regression just for example. Then you can try out
both of those models here and then you
can figure like decision trees is working way
better and then you go into the decision tree and then you do you prune it differently, or you do some other stuff or do some different
layers and you experiment with it more after
you've decided, okay. I'm going to go
with decision trees versus logistical regression. Is that the idea here? Yeah, but that's the idea here. If you look at my screen, this is just a regular dataset. I think it's the PM
diabetes dataset. Just by calling compare models, you can download
all these models and the run them in parallel. You go to whatever
metric score you're trying to achieve
or maximize and you see here I'm going for F1, F1 looks like it's
the highest for extreme gradient boosting
and then I go to sklearn and then try to build it manually and then improve it. Maybe I do some boosting, maybe some bagging and so on. Perfect. But this gives you
the base scoring and it saves you a lot of time. When I was an undergrad,
I didn't know about this and plenty of times I would run into just like hours of trying to go
pipelines and they will break, run out of memory and this
really helped me out. I found it, I think it was the first month that
I started MADS, I just had a bunch of
data science stuff coming up on YouTube
and I found a short. I was like, wow,
this is amazing. It's going to save me hours. There are things like
the optimized functions, however, I feel like whenever I was using their
optimized functions, I kept running
into, I would say, not the best solutions and doing something
like Brit search by myself would end up yielding better results,
just as a warning. But who knows what you can
do with specific module. They have other
metrics too like you can plot your model so you can see the learning
curves and so on. Break down your matrices. That's awesome. Thank you. No problem. It might be good to
post in the chat. Or the link I sent it out
on the chat to both of you. You can just click on it
and access the website. I would book market for you
because it can be super helpful even outside of mad like say you're doing
personal projects. It can help speed
things up at least. Or give you some idea of
what you're working with before you approach
the problem yourself. Does it do mainly
machine-learning models that aren't deep learning? This is the base for supervised
and unsupervised models, it's all the popular ones. There are some
statistical models, although I have not used them, but I know they do exist
within this module. I know when it comes
to deep learning, they don't have any, but you can add it to their
system yourself. You can run it under
their metrics, so you can do or have access to all their
plotting features. I've done that before with Bert. It did allow me to create like 12 graphs within a
couple lines of code. It was worth it because
it saves you time. Well, these look the best and, actually to write them myself. That's awesome, so helpful. Thanks. This is been
really helpful. I think I have to leave
now. Have a good night. You too. Good night. Thank you. Since I'm just going to ask questions
and no one else came. It says that the
maximum is 1,500 but like a number of my
answers are only like five or 600 words. Am I like really on
the wrong track? Like some of them are like that number eight or has like 1
billion questions. That one's long and some of
them are longer than others, but like I felt like I answered every
single one of the pieces. But I'm like maybe a depth
or something. I don't know. Is it about three paragraphs
that you have so far? Three or four paragraphs? Yeah. There's like
multiple paragraphs but it's still only
like 500-words. I think you should be fine. Just make sure that
you're answering all the questions and you're
giving your reasoning why. To be frank, when I took
the milestone exam, my answers were also very short, but I was able to
score pretty decent. I was also worried
about the same thing. I think one of my responses was three paragraphs and
I earned full credit. It really depends
on your content. Let me pause recording
it right now. Well, since I didn't [inaudible] We have I think just two exams
and a couple of quizzes in each course just to make sure you're up to date and
getting all the information. That I would say one of
the highlights about, it's no nightmares about
midterms and finals. That's true. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. All of your time and have fun with your projects
that you're mentoring. Will do. Thank you so much, Alexis. Bye. No problem. Have a good day. That concludes my office hours. We paused for a little bit
because she was explaining her approach to one of her questions or
responses for the exam. We were like thinking
through the logic of it, the reason why it was possible, is because that really shouldn't be shared
because other people can copy her logic and reasoning on how to answer
the specific question. But, if anyone has
any questions, feel free to reach out
to me or the rest of the instructional team and
have a good night. Bye.
