In this video, I'm
going to be reviewing the project guidelines
for Milestone 2, and all of these
guidelines can be found in the document links
in the slides in case you forget anything
or have any questions. In my opinion, the project is the most fun component
of this milestone. It's an opportunity to practice and demonstrate synthesis of all the skills that
you've been learning so far from data exploration
and analysis, to model development, feature development,
and validation, to communicating
those results in reports and presenting
it to an audience. I'm going to be going
over a few things here. The first is what datasets and what modeling techniques are
expected for this project. We, the instructors,
are providing a few sample datasets and
you're also welcome to select your own as long as it's not
a dataset that's publicly available or that's
been previously worked on in for example a
Kaggle competition. If you do decide to
choose your own, please run that by the
instructors beforehand. The project requires
two components. One is going to be an
supervised learning components and the other is an
unsupervised learning, and you're welcome to use the same dataset that you used for the supervised
part with the unsupervised or if there's not a reasonable way to turn it into an unsupervised project, you also have the
option of choosing a second dataset for the
unsupervised components. Of course, those same guidelines about public availability
still apply. Timeline for the project. There are basically four steps. We're going to start
with team formation. Then you'll put together
a draft proposal. Those proposals will be peer reviewed and then reviewed
by the instructors. Then you'll obviously
work on the project and put together a final
report which you'll submit. The first step after forming
a group will be to the select a dataset and to
develop project proposal. This proposal is
a short document. The specific guidelines are listed again in the project
guidelines document, but basically it's
a short document that you'll put
together to pitch your analysis and
evaluation techniques and to solicit feedback from
your peers and instructor. The next step will be
to submit this proposal and it will be
assigned to peers in your course and your cohorts
to evaluate based on a few questions and criteria
that we give you from, does the analysis
technique makes sense? Can you suggest anything
that's missing? Is the proposal
communicated effectively? Not only will you be
receiving this feedback, but you'll also have
an opportunity to see some of your peers proposals and provide that
feedback for that. Next we, the instructors
will provide some quick feedback
and then you have runway to develop and
work on the projects. What does the final
report look like? You're going to be introducing the dataset and the problem and your approach and
why you selected it, and then showing us
what your approach was, what the results were compared to a baseline that
you will provide, and then discussing
those results, what the limitations
of your approach or the dataset might have been. That's it. We're really
excited about the projects. Again, you could find all of the guidelines listed
in the document online. As always, please feel free to reach
out with any questions.
