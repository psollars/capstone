Hi, we've made this short video
to explain some of the main points regarding the comprehensive
exam component of Milestone II. So if you haven't already,
I highly encourage you to read the Comprehensive Exam guidelines document
that's linked from the course shell. In the about Milestone II
Comprehensive Exam in quiz section, you'll see this reading. The reading takes you to a link,
to a document which is the official document for the course that
explains all of the policies. The process and so forth for
the Comprehensive Written Exam and the document looks something like this. Again, please read this carefully. It contains very important
information that's critical to the process of successfully
completing the exam. Perhaps most importantly, it also contains
the written exam questions at the end. We'll talk about that in a minute, but
please read this document carefully. The Milestone II Comprehensive Exam
gives you an opportunity to sub synthesize the data analytic
skills you've learned so far. And all the different records of courses
that have led you to Milestone II. You've covered a lot of ground,
you've learned a lot of techniques and Milestone II is an opportunity to
synthesize those to kind of look to see what are the common ideas
across courses that recur. How those apply to specific
data science problems. And so the Comprehensive Exam part of Milestone II is designed both for
depth and breath. So the synthesis questions which
we ask you to respond to with written answers are an opportunity
to kind of explore specific topics. But doing so in a way that synthesizes
your knowledge across courses. So there'll be some theme where you
draw on multiple examples from, let's say deep learning,
supervised learning, data mining in order to
answer a particular question. And then there's also a breadth
component to the Comprehensive Exam, in that there's a set of quizzes which
are low stakes they're unproctored. They're short multiple-choice,
there's no coding required, but the idea of the comprehensive
quizzes to give some breath. So there's a broader set of questions
that touch on a variety of critical topics from the prerequisite courses,
especially the immediate prerequisites like supervised learning,
causal inference and so forth. In order to draw up the exam questions,
we work closely with instructors from these other courses from the key
prerequisites to Milestone II in creating these synthesis questions and
the quiz questions. So the idea is that at
the start of the course, you'll be given a list of all the possible
exam questions that we might ask. So you'll have plenty of time
to look at the questions, think about them,
start preparing answers to them. And the complete set of
questions are at the end of the Comprehensive Exam
guidelines document. And then somewhere around Week 3, you can
look at Coursera for the specific dates. You'll be told which two questions
from this set you'll need to answer, and you'll be given a deadline with
a specific limited time window to submit your answer to those two questions. So you don't have to submit answers
to all the questions [LAUGH] that are in the guidelines document, you'll be told which to specifically
you'll need to answer out of that set. So the idea would be that you spend
some time in advance preparing answers to questions. And then by the time you're told which two
you're going to be submitting answers to, you might take a little bit of extra time
to refine answers to those questions. But in general, you should have
plenty of time to study and think about the topics that are covered. So here's an example question
that was used in the past. You can see that it asks you
about the design of a system, a machine learning pipeline
that achieves stated goals. So it sort of tries to synthesize
your knowledge of data mining, how to track a set of popular topics and how that progresses over time. Touches on machine learning
methods about how to model topics. They ask you to think about
tradeoffs between performance and accuracy and so forth. So this is the kind of question. So the idea is that you would
structure your answer in a way systematically that addresses the
questions that are posed in the document. And you do so in a logical way where you, you draw on examples from
techniques you've learned about. You develop a logical
description of the answer, you justify your choice of methods. You talk about trade offs and
you point to evidence for why these trade offs exist and so forth. The answers you get to these
questions are graded according to a well defined rubric,
which is available to you through a link in the comprehensive
exam guidelines document. And we basically look for
two dimensions to your answer. One of them is the content itself. Do you cover substantial related relevant information in your answer? Do you cover the questions
that were asked thoroughly? Do you show that you have some
insight into the problem? And so a great answer, content wise would
be one where you kind of draw an abundance of material that's clearly related to
the questions that are being asked. You're answering the points, you're making
clear points to answer the questions. You're giving supporting evidence if
necessary, you're justifying your choice of methods or approaches across
a variety of approaches or materials. So poor answer content wise would
be one where you give potentially a great deal of information, but it's
not clearly connected to the question. Or it's not stated clearly as an answer
where you're not supporting or justifying your choices, you're not
stating your assumptions and so forth. And then the second dimension is on the
coherence and organization of the writing. Great answer would be,
are you clearly stating and developing your answers systematically and
logically? Are you choosing specific
examples that are appropriate? Is there a clear conclusion? Does it flow well? And in general,
just is it well organized and logical? And poor answers in this category,
this dimension would be, answers that are choppy,
that where one point does not logically follow from the others,
where the answers are vague. There's no logical order presentation. So these are the two main
dimensions of evaluation. And then for the quiz,
it's a low stakes quiz. There's no proctoring. As I said, there's no coding involved. These are just short multiple
choice questions based on the same prerequisite courses you've had. For these, there is a time limit although
it's a pretty generous one and there's a limited number of retry attempts so you
don't get an infinite number of retrieves. They're just a small number
of attempts you're given but you'll have time to study for these,
at least one re attempt if necessary. It's relatively low stakes as I said,
it's only about 5% of the course grade and you can take
the quiz any time in Weeks 2-4. So the quiz has been broken
into separate modules. There are three of them currently and so
you can take your time to do each one, you don't have to do all
the questions at once. So for both the written synthesis
questions and the quiz questions, feel free to leverage Slack or email with
your peers over the instructional team. The instructional team won't be available
to help you work through ideas. Please see the course Slack channel and
the Coursera calendar for details on office hours and
appointments that you can make. And we encourage students to form
informal study groups at a high level, you can discuss sort of ideas and
solutions at a high level of course. Ultimately, the answers that you
submit have to be your own writing and that's make sure you read the policy
in the Comprehensive Exam guideline, you have to submit your own work. It has to be your writing. You can definitely discuss at
a high level with other folks, but ultimately it has to be your submission. So some students have found study
groups and to be helpful for this, instructional team isn't involved in
setting those up or coordinating them, but definitely feel free to do that
if you feel it would be helpful.
