Hi everyone. Welcome to the Masters of Applied
Data Science Milestone 2. I'm Kevyn Collins Thompson
and Doctor Coco Krumme, would like to welcome
you to this course. I'm particularly excited
to be involved with Milestone 2 because
the project component is near and dear to my heart, I've led many different
capstone type courses at the University of Michigan. I'm always impressed
by the wide array of talent that's on display
through these projects. It matches well
with my background. I've spent about 15 years
in industry working on some pretty cool software
engineering projects. My background is in software
engineering originally. I'm always fascinated by where research meets
software engineering. I'm really looking forward
to working with all of you. Now I'll let Dr. Coco
Krumme introduce herself. Hi everybody. I'm Coco and I want to echo Kevyn's
welcome to the course. I'm very excited to be one
of your instructors and looking forward to
getting to know you. A little bit about me, I have a background
in applied math and actually evolutionary
biology is what I studied as an undergrad at Yale. After undergrad, I went
back to the Bay Area, California, which
is where I'm from and worked for a small startup. Being a data scientists
before the term was even coined and enjoyed that. But really wanted to go
back to grad school and went back to MIT and
got my PhD there. Then hopped back
to industry and of tech startup world where ever since then I've been
heading up data teams. I founded the data team and grew the data science and
engineering team for another startup in
the logistics space. A few years ago, I started my own consulting
practice where I work with companies primarily in fields involving complex systems
like earth sciences, climate science, agriculture, even
insurance and logistics. I really enjoy
those places where behavioral science and more of the physical world or
as sciences intersect and helping them
with data science, data engineering,
overall data strategy. I also really enjoy
teaching and spent a number of years with the masters in data science
program at UC Berkeley, helping develop and teach
a few courses there, including causal inference
and the capstone course, which was also a
project based course. That's me. I'm very much looking forward to kicking off the milestone and getting
to know all of you. I know all of you have taken
the Milestone 1 course already and the Milestone 2
course is going to follow roughly the same timeline and
have the same components of the project component and a comprehensive exam
tech component. Those things are similar and the timelines in terms of month one being devoted mostly
to the comprehensive exam, although we will get some
project proposal started and month two being devoted
to the project itself that hasn't changed
from Milestone 1. I'll focus on some of the
things that have changed a little bit in walking
through the syllabus. I encourage you as
always to please look at the syllabus in detail
for our course policies. Here we go. Like Milestone 1, the main goals of this course
are to allow you to add an interesting project to your portfolio that demonstrates the skills that you've acquired
so far in this degree. I know all of you have
been working really hard. You've taken lots of
really cool courses. Here's one opportunity now to apply those things together. Both for the technical
side and coding, particular demonstrating supervised and unsupervised
learning methods. Also again in technical
communication in writing up your results in the correct
and coherent fashion. The milestone is also
an opportunity with a checkpoint for you
to review and to test your knowledge in
a pretty broad, comprehensive fashion based
on what you've learned from the prerequisites and so there's a breadth component
in the comprehensive exam. That goes into depth on
some specific questions. That are drawn from the
prerequisite courses. As in Milestone 1, we contacted the instructors for the
prerequisites have them submit what they felt were
really substantial questions that will be excellent
opportunities for synthesized what you've
learned in those courses. In terms of the
project component. The main changes is that in the project
you'll be required to demonstrate both supervised
machine learning and unsupervised learning
methods as part of the project. In addition, for the
supervised part, we provided some private
competition datasets for you to choose from as the basis for
the supervised part. You can also apply unsupervised methods to the
same dataset if you want. Or you can also choose your own dataset for the
unsupervised learning part. The datasets have to satisfy certain conditions which are
outlined in the syllabus. They can't be subject to a non-disclosure agreements that have been basically
the instructors. They need to get access to your datasets if they need them. The datasets have
to be satisfied some minimal criteria in
terms of the challenge. They have to have
decent amount of data. They have to have some interesting
features and so forth. But all that's outlined
in the syllabus. There is some scope, in some cases for using your own dataset for
the supervised learning part. Although we expect
that most people will want to do the
Kaggle competitions. Again, satellite and syllabus, but you can talk to the instructors if you
have a special case. If you have a work-related or school-related problem
dataset project that you're working on, where the data can be
accessible to the instructors, where it makes sense for
you to focus on that. That's your projects.
That's really one of the main
differences in terms of the project component
for Milestone 1. The other difference
between Milestone 2 and Milestone 1 in terms
of the project, is that we've waited
the project more highly in the grading
scheme for Milestone 2. The project itself is worth, if you include some
of the proposal and things is worth
roughly 60 percent. I'll just say a little
bit briefly about the timeline for Milestone 2. Essentially, as in Milestone 1, gets started forming your team, selecting the project and putting together a
short project proposal. In Weeks 1 and 2. Week 3, there'll be a peer
review process or you'll get feedback from two of your
peers of the proposal. You didn't have the chance
to iterate and then submit the revised project
proposal same week of the comprehensive exams. The idea is that by
the end of Week 4, you'll have done the exam. You'll done the quiz. You'll have a concrete
finalized project proposal and you'll be ready to go. You'll just spend all of the second month on
the project itself. That's really the high-level
summary of Milestone 2. There'll be more
detailed descriptions of the project requirements and the comprehensive exam in
separate documents and videos. As always, if you have
any questions at all, feel free to reach out to
us on Slack or via email. We're really looking
forward to working with you. Talk to you soon.
