Math methods for
data science, polynomials. Polynomials are a family of
functions composed of many different algebraic terms
where x is the variable, a sub 0, or a-naught,
is the constant term. A1 is the linear coefficient,
or the first order coefficient. a2 is a quadratic coefficient. a3 is a cubic coefficient. And an is the nth order coefficient. n is the degree of the polynomial, it's the largest power that
appears in the equation. A polynomial of degree n has n plus 1 coefficients, a-naught through an. Polynomials have many properties,
including a domain. A domain is the values of x such that
x is in the set of all real numbers. Polynomials are defined for
all inputs xnR. This notation tells us that all values of x are contained
in that particular set of numbers. The roots of a function, again, here,
we're seeing the f of x notation, are the values of x for
which the function equals 0. The image of a polynomial function
depends on the coefficients. An image or range of a function is the set of all
possible output values of the function. Adding two polynomials together
will produce a third polynomial. When we solve polynomial equations,
one approach is to make one side of the equation equal to 0
such that c of x is equal to 0. Using algebraic methods to
convert to standard form, we can then use the quadratic formula,
mostly for second order polynomials or computers such as Python's numpy package,
to solve. Remember the quadratic equation
x is equal to negative b plus or minus the square root of
b-squared minus 4ac over 2a. Let's solve a polynomial equation. Say we have two polynomials
where A of x is equal to B of x. And we will set A of x equal
to 4x-squared plus 5x, and B of x equal to negative
2x-squared plus x plus 2. If we rewrite these two equations and
set them equal to each other, we can perform some basic algebra
to set these equations equal to 0. So first, let's subtract 2 from each side. Then, we can subtract x from each side. And finally, we'll subtract
negative 2x-squared from each side. Here, we've turned these two
polynomials into standard form, where we have a new equation 6x-squared
plus 4x minus 2 is equal to C of x. Once I have this equation in standard
form, I'm going to rewrite it here. We can use the quadratic
equation to solve for x. So here, a is equal to 6, b is equal to 4, and c is equal to negative 2. We can plug in all of these
numbers into our quadratic formula where we're plugging in 4 for b,
6 for a, and negative 2 for c. Again, do some algebra. Here, we have 4-squared, which is 16. 4 times 6 is 24 times negative 2. All over 12. And we have negative 4 minus or plus the square root of 16 plus 48. All over 12. Gives us negative 4 plus or minus square root of 64, which is 8. All over 12. Now, the plus or minus here
indicates that we have two parts. Negative 4 minus 8 over 12, which gives us negative 12 over 12,
or negative 1. And we also have negative
4 plus 8 over 12, which gives us 4 over 12, or one-third. So here, x has two solutions,
negative 1 and one-third.
