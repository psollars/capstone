Hello, and welcome to Math Methods for
Data Science. I'm Professor Grant Schoenebeck, an assistant professor at the University
of Michigan School of Information. I'm a theoretical computer
scientist by training. My recent research has focused on studying
social networks and mechanism design for information elicitation. I have a passion for mathematics,
and while I love both useful and useless mathematics,
this course focuses on the useful kind. As you look at the syllabus, you'll notice we have an ambitious
amount of material we are covering. That said, we will not cover
all these topics in depth. We're doing more of a survey approach, picking out the important concepts you're
going to need later in the program. So think of this as a foundations
course that you can refer back to as you get deeper into the machine
learning and data mining courses. A familiarity with these topics should
serve you greatly in later courses, as well as any further
practice in data science. You're all coming in with
a wide range of math skills. On my end, this makes it difficult to pin down the
level at which the course will be taught. So hang in there and keep the course objectives in mind,
which can be found in the syllabus. This course is four weeks, and
has a math review assignment to see if or where you need some refreshers on
math concepts, a problem set for each week that involves
Jupyter notebooks and Python. And two short writing assignments designed
to get you to see how these concepts are applied to data science research. You will notice that I'm not in many of
the videos, which were created by Dr. Erin Ware, a research professor at
the Institute for Social Research. Math Methods is one of the first courses
you're taking in the data science program. As the online experience may be new for
you, the online teaching experience
will be new for me. I hope you are looking forward
to it as much as I am.
