Methods for data science vectors. Concepts components and
representation in two-dimensions. What are vectors? Vectors are multi-dimensional objects. They're a way to describe
directions in space? Classically vectors describe physical
quantities like velocity acceleration and net force. They are integral parts of data science
computer graphics, machine learning, and probability theory. Vectors are built from components. You can also think of vectors
as a set of numbers or a list of numbers in two dimensions
of vector will have two numbers. A vector is composed of two components in a two-dimensions vx and vy. Vector algebra can be defined as
operations performed on a list of numbers. Let's look at an example from physics
of how we should think of vectors. We're going to use a vector
to describe velocity. Let's say a ball is traveling
at 15 meters per second. We could have two separate vectors v1
in which our components are 0 and 15. This tells us that this
ball is traveling in the y direction at 15 meters per second. Or we could have vector 2 with
the components 15 and 0 telling us that this ball is traveling in the x
direction at 15 meters per second. Vectors tell us what direction
the ball is traveling, but they also tell us the speed. Therefore these vectors
are telling us both the speed and direction of a particular object. A two-dimensional vector
contains two numbers where the vector v is equivalent to (vx, vy). The vector v is such that v is in
the set of real numbers squared. We have the square because there
are two components within the vector. The value of vx is called
the X-component of the vector and the v y is called
the Y-component of the vector. Vectors are represented in
a number of different methods. All of these methods are equivalent. Our first set of notation is
called component notation. This is what we've seen thus far. In this case, a vector is represented
as a pair of coordinates, vx and vy. We also have something called unit vector
notation that we'll discuss more in a future lecture. These vectors are expressed
in terms of unit vectors, where unit vector i represented
as i with a carrot on top is equal to (1,0) and j is equal to (0,1). Finally, we have a length and
direction notation, represented in terms of
the length of a vector which is represented as the vector inside
of two bars and an angle or the angle theta relative to the x-axis. Unfortunately, vector
notation is not standardized. Some authors try to help by making
numbers constance Greek letters and vectors lowercase letters. Some use bold font and
lowercase for vectors. And some use arrows
above lowercase letters. All three of these
notations are equivalent. I will try to consistently use
the vector notation that has the arrow on top of a lowercase letter.
