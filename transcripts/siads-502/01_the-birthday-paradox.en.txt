Welcome back to math methods for
data science. In this video, we're going to talk about
the birthday paradox in the birthday paradox or birthday problem. The question is how many people must be
in a room to make it more likely than not that two of them have the same birthday. We're going to assume that each of
the 365 birthdays is equally likely. Notice that if there
are 366 people in the room, two of them must have the same birthday. But the question here is how many need to
be in the room to make it more likely than not that two of them
have the same birthday. Take a moment and think about it and give it a guess before
turning to the next slide. It turns out that the correct answer is
23 which is less than most people expect. What we noticed is that if there's
only a few people in the room, indeed, the chance of them sharing
the same birthday is quite rare. However, things shoot up
rather quickly between 10 and 20 then once it's very likely that
two people have the same birthday. So over 99% likely at 60 people,
the rate growth rate slows dramatically. Yeah, I had a colleague who tried this
in a real classroom with 85 students and actually went through all 85 without
finding to that had the same birthday. So that was really quite
an unhappy circumstance for him. Why is our intuition often wrong here? It turns out that when we think about it,
we kind of substitute in the problem. How likely is it that someone
has the same birthday with me? But that's not what the question asks, how likely is it that two
people have the same birthday? If we slightly changed the problem to be? How many pairs of people
have the same birthday, then we can use our linear
narrative expectation. There are n choose two pairs of people, each pair has probability one over
365 of sharing the same birthday. First person's birthday is what it is, and the second person has a one out of 365
chance of having that same birthday. So we see that this quantity here, the expectation of the number
of pairs of people. The same birthday depends on and
squared rather than and so it's going to grow quickly according and
squared. As the number of people in the room grows
notice for 23 people, this is 230.69. So slightly more than the probability
off there exists a couple in the room that shares the same birthday because
there may exist more than one. So in the next slide, we're going to be
precise and avoid this double counting. Let BNB the probability some pair of N
people share the same birthday notice. If there's just one person, there cannot
be a pair that shares the same birthday. If there are two people,
it's one of the 365 as computer before. If there are three people, well, what's the chance that two of
them share the same birthday? Let's compute instead the chance that
two of them do not share the same birthday to this quantity here,
and we'll take one minus that. So for them,
do not share the same birthday. The second person have must have a
different birthday than the first person, but also the third person must have
a different birthday than the first two. The probability of the second
person having a different birth in the first person. It has 364 divided by 365,
there's only one bad day there. The chance of the third person has
a different bridge in the first two is 363 divided by 365. And as we go up,
we'll just keep on multiplying this. So if there are any people, the chance
that the Earth person does not share a birthday with the first and minus one
people is 365 minus and minus 1/3 and 65. So it's just this product here, and that will give us an exact
calculation off this probability. This is part of a more general problem. So the birthday paradox come up in
different settings with different numbers of days of in general. There's this handy approximation the
number of items required to make it more probable than not that there
is a collision to people. It's the same birthday when there
are D days is the square root off to log in times D? So this is about square root of 1.39
times D, so here's the problem. If we have a million account numbers and we assign them randomly after how
many accounts were you expecting it? A duplicate okay, well, that's just
square root of 1.39 times a million. So right off the bat, we can estimate that
it's around 1000 because the squared of a million would be 1000. In fact, the answer that we get using
this formula are precisely is 1177. So we would need about 1177
accounts before we had a duplicate. So may be more likely than you think,
because it varies with the square root of the number of days,
rather than the number of days themselves.
