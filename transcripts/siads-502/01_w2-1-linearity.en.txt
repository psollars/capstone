Math methods for
data science week 2, linearity. Linearity is the foundation
of linear algebra. Let's look at a polynomial equation
written two different ways. You can see each x value has
a polynomial and a coefficients, mx is the linear term in this expression. It has x raised to the first power,
all the other terms are nonlinear. Linear terms are special and that changing
the value of the input x will lead to proportional changes in the value of mx. If the input is 2x, then the linear
term will have a value of 2mx. If the input is 50x, then the linear
term will have a value 50mx. This type of input/output proportionality
doesn't hold for nonlinear terms. A single-variable function takes
a real number x as an input and outputs are real number y. One of the most general linear functions
is from the set of real numbers to another set of real numbers. And this can be written as y is equivalent to the function f(x) which is equal to mx. Where m is a value in the set of real
numbers and is called the coefficient. The purpose of this function
is to multiply the input by m to get a value of y. Composition. What is a composition? Given two linear functions f(x) = 2x and
g(y) = 3y. What is the equation of
the function h(x) which is equivalent to g of f(x) or
written g(f(x))? Let's write this composition
out using substitution. The composition of f(x)
equals 2 times x and g(y) = 3y is the function h(x), which is equivalent to g of f(x), which is equivalent to 3 times 2x or 6x. Composition is combining two functions
by substituting one function's formula in the place of each x and
the other function's formula. What is a linear function? A linear function maps linear combinations
of inputs to the same linear combination of outputs. A function f is linear if it satisfies the equation f of alpha
x1 plus beta x2 equals alpha f(x1) plus beta f(x2), for any two inputs x1 and x2 and for all constants alpha and beta. Are lines linear functions? Let's think about the equation of a line. l(x) = mx + b, where the constant m
corresponds to the slope of a line and the constant b is equivalent to
the y-intercept when f(x) = 0. Let's see if the equation for a line,
l(x) = mx + b satisfies a linear function. First, we're going to
write the equation of the line substituting
alpha x1 + beta x2 for x. So here we have l of alpha x1 plus beta x2 equals m times alpha x1 plus beta x2 plus b, we'll distribute the m. So now we have m alpha x1 plus m beta x2 plus b. We're looking to see if alpha l of x1 plus beta l of x2 is equivalent to m alpha x1 plus m beta x2. Because of this additional constant term,
we can say that these are not equivalent and therefore, the equation
of a line is not a linear function. This is actually a different type of
function where the constant is added to a linear term. This is called an affine transformation,
but it's a topic not covered in this course. Since linear algebra
studies all things linear, we need to look at cases of functions
with multiple variables as input. Let's set up a situation where
we take a pair of real numbers. R and R, and
we map them onto the set of real numbers. The most general linear
function of two variables is f(x,y) = mx times x + my times y. mx can be thought of as the x-slope and my can be thought of as
the y-slope of the function. mx is the coefficient in x and
my is the y-coefficient in the linear expression
mx times x plus my times y. Let's look at an example. f(x,y) = 6x + 5y- 4, we can rewrite this as 4 = 6x + 5y, and then we can solve for x and we can solve for y. So in order to solve for x,
we would substitute a 0 into y. And solve for x,
where x would equal four-sixths or two-thirds, and then we can solve for y by substituting in 0 for x, And we would get y equal
to four-fifths and then we can map where these points
are on a coordinate system. Remember, x equal to four-sixths and y equal to four-fifths. On our coordinate system, We can map the intercepts at
x equal to four-sixths and y equal to four-fifths, and
draw a line through those points. Here we are learning a new
term linear expression. A linear expression in the variables x1,
x2 and x3 has the form a1 times x1 plus
a2 times x2 plus a3 times x3. Where x1, x2 and x3 are arbitrary constants in
something like in the variables or in v refers to an expression in which all
included variables are to the first power. What does this mean linear in v? While this expression here
contains nonlinear terms, 1 over a, b to the 7th and
the square root of c. It is still a linear expression
in the variables x1, x2 and x3 because those are all to the 1. A linear equation in the variables x1, x2 and x3 has the form a1x1 plus a2x2 plus a3x3 equals c. It is linear only because those
x values are to the power of 1. Let's say we're talking
about an equation like this. 4x- 2y + 8z = 10, where x, y, and z correspond to the three variables of interest. We can rewrite this using variable
y as a function of x and z. y(x,z) = 2x + 4z- 5, this is done by just doing some algebra to solve for y. We can take the same equation and
solve for a different variable. Perhaps we could interpret a write this differently in terms of x
as a function of y and z, such that x is this function of y and z, where we have ten-fourths
plus y halves minus 2z. A real-world example of this might
be if you want to predict x, but you know the values of y and z, or
the previous example, where you know x and z and want to predict values of y. Linear equations have multiple
applications in data science. There are geometric interpretations,
such as a line or a plane. There are also first-order approximations. Linear models or
first-order approximations or functions represented as
infinite Taylor series. This would have been a topic
covered in calculus.
