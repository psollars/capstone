Math methods for data science, vectors, dimensions, and basis. Remember that an n vector
is a vector of size n. N also refers to
the dimension of a vector. Two-dimensional and
three-dimensional or 2D and 3D vectors or the most intuitive to work
with because we can visualize them on
Cartesian planes. The general representation for an n vector is a vector
v with components v1, v2 up to vn that are subsets
of the real numbers. When we get into
talking about basis, it's much easier to think of our vectors in terms of
unit vector notation. We discussed this in
a previous lecture. In three-dimensions,
a unit vector points a vector in one of
the three dimensions x, y, or z. This is the same representation
as a Cartesian plane, with a third z-axis. The unit vectors are
represented as i, j, and k. In other words, the i unit vector is
pointing in the direction x, the j unit vector is
pointing in the direction y and the k unit vector is
pointing in the direction z. The i, j, and k vectors are the backbone of a standard basis
in three-dimensions. When we talk about the basis, it's very convenient to think of a three-dimensional vector in the three-dimensional space
of an xyz-coordinate system. For instance, the vector
negative three, two, two, can also be written in
unit vector form as negative 3 times the i vector plus 2 times the j vector plus
2 times the k vector. Here's the v vector in
three-dimensional space. But what if we change
the basis and we're no longer in the
xyz-coordinate system. First, let's actually
define what a basis is. Say we have a three-dimensional
vector space R cubed a basis for R cube is
a set of vectors e1, e2, e3 that can be used as a coordinate system
for the real numbers. If e1, e2, and e3 is in basis, you can represent any vector v in the real number space
as coefficients v1, v2, v3 with respect
to that basis. In other words, we can
write these vectors as a vector v equal to
the coefficient v1 times the unit vector e1
plus the coefficient v2 times the unit vector e2 plus a coefficient v3 times
the unit vector e3. We won't deal much with the math
behind changes of basis. However, there's
a very intuitive example often used in computing. Say, we want to set a color on a computer using the RGB system. RGB indicates how
much red, green, or blue is included in
this particular color. We can represent the RGB as a vector with bases r, g, and b. For instance, the University
of Michigan color maize is represented by the vector
255, 203, and five. These represent how much red, green, and blue go
into the color. Umich blue is a vector 0, 39, 76. The goal here is to
understand the concept of basis just saying that we can represent these colors
with respect to a particular set of
values r, g, and b.
