Math methods for Data Science, Bayes' Rule and Maximum Likelihoods: Probability
Review - Addition Rules. Before we get too far into
all of the probability rules, I want to give you a cheat sheet. I have here the addition
rules, the "ORs", the "ANDs", the
multiplication rules, and the conditional rules, as well as different specifications for
different cases of events, such as in general
independent events and mutually exclusive events. Mutually exclusive
events are those where events A and
B do not overlap. Independent events happen when knowing that A occurs does not change the
probability of B, and general events are when neither of those
two cases are met. This is a good reference
to come back to when doing
probability problems. To compute probabilities
of the form P of A or B, we use the general addition rule. For any two events A and B, the probability of A or B is equal to the
probability of A plus the probability of B minus the probability of A and B. Just a word of warning, "OR" does not mean what
you think it does. In statistics "OR" is all of the events in
one condition plus all of the events in
the second condition minus all of the events that
overlap the two conditions. Let's look at a general
addition rule example. We are given the probability
of A equal to 0.76, the probability of
B equal to 0.22, and the probability of
A and B equal to 0.18. What is the
probability of A or B? Well in general,
addition rule tells us that the probability of A or B should equal the probability of
A plus the probability of B minus the probability
of A and B. In this case we can
plug in those values, probability of A plus the
probability of B minus the probability of A
and A and we get 0.8. So the probability of A
or B is equal to 0.8. Typically, we don't turn
probabilities into percentages. Let's look at one more example of a general addition rule. Find the probability that
a randomly selected person is likely to vote
or favors the law. In this case, we want
everybody in one outcome. So all of those who
are likely to vote plus all of those who are in favor of the law
minus the overlap. So the probability
of those likely to vote is equal to 721 over a 1000, probability of those in favor of the law is equal
to 523 over 1000, and the probability of likely
to vote and in favor of the law is the overlap
or 372 over a 1000. Then we just plug this into our general addition
rule equation. Seven hundred and twenty
one over 1000 plus 523 over 1000 minus
372 over a 1000, gives us 872 over 1000 or 0.872. In the special case of
mutually exclusive events, we can simplify
the general addition rule. If A and B are mutually
exclusive events then the probability of A
or B is every outcome that satisfies
event A plus every outcome that satisfies event B
minus the overlap, but because this is
mutually exclusive, we're subtracting zero, and we can eliminate that
from our equation. This rule can be extended to more than two mutually
exclusive events. Let's look at
conditional probability. Approximately 15 percent of adult men in the US are
more than six feet tall. Therefore if a man is
selected at random, the probability that he is more than six feet tall is 0.15. Now assume that you learn that the selected man is a
professional basketball player. With this extra information, the probability that
the man is more than six feet tall becomes much
greater than 0.15. A probability that is computed
with the knowledge of additional information is called a conditional probability. The conditional probability
of an event B given an event A is denoted
by P of B given A. P of B given A
is the probability that B occurs under the assumption that A
has already occurred. The probability is computed as, the probability of B given A
is equal to the probability of A and B over the
probability of A. This can also be reversed. The probability of A given B
is equal to the probability of A and B over the
probability of B. Consider the following table
which presents a number of US men and women in millions
25 years and older, and their favorite type of book. If we select a person at random, What is the probability
that that person is a man? In order to calculate
this probability, we need to know the total number
of men in the sample. So we would take the sum of all of the different
book categories and get 94 million men in
this particular sample. We then need to calculate
the total number of individuals in
the sample so we can add the number of women in millions and get
101 million women, adding these together gives us 195 million individuals
in the sample. So what is the probability
that the person is a man? Ninety four million out of a
195 million gives us 0.48. What is the probability
that the person we randomly select is a man
who likes True Crime? The outcomes that satisfy this condition
True Crime and male are 29.6 million out of
a 195 million individuals, giving me 0.15 as the probability that
a randomly selected individual is a man who likes True Crime. Now, let's find the probability
that the person likes True Crime given that
the person is a male. We now need to calculate the
probability that they like True Crime given that the randomly selected
person is male. Therefore, we're
creating a denominator of men only which we
know is 94 million, and then the number of men who like True Crime as 29.6 million, and we get a probability of 0.31 as the conditional probability that given we have
selected a male, the probability that
that person likes True Crime.
