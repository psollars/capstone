Math methods for Data Science, probability review; multiplication rules and
conditional probability. Remember our cheat sheet. Today, we're going
to be talking about the second column and
the third column. The general method for computing conditional probabilities
provides a way to compute probabilities for
events in the form A and B, we can also write this
as A intersect B. So for any two events, A and B, the probability of
A and B is equal to the probability of A times
the probability of B given A, or we can say that the probability
of A and B is equal to the probability of B times
the probability of A given B. So for instance, say
we're given this table, where we have tick bites; tick bite yes or tick bite no, and Lyme disease; Lyme disease
yes and Lyme disease no, and we have counts for
each of these categories. What is the probability of having a tick bite and
having Lyme disease? Well, we can define
our events A as having a tick bite and B has
having Lyme disease, and calculate our probability
of A and B equal to the probability of A times
the probability of B given A. So let's find the
probability of A, that would be the
probability of a tick bite. There are nine individuals here who have had
a tick bite out of 40, and so we'll take nine over
40 and we're going to multiply this times the
probability of B given A. Since we're saying given A, we're not including anyone
who has not had a tick bite, since our denominator
is going to be only those who have
had a tick bite. So out of those who've
had a tick bite, how many have Lyme disease? Seven out of nine. This gives us 7 over 40
which is equal to 0.175. So the probability of
having a tick bite and having Lyme disease is 0.175. You might also notice that
this is the probability of the intersection which is why we use the symbol intersect. Where does tick bite and
Lyme disease intersect? Seven out of the total 40, which is exactly what we calculated to get
this probability. Let's look at another example. At company Y, the probability of having computer brand A is 0.3. Of those who have
computer brand A, the probability that it has been infected with the
Z virus is 0.22. Find the probability that
a computer at this company is brand A and infected
with virus Z. Let's write down what we know. We know that the
probability of brand A at this company is 0.3
and we know that the probability of being
infected with viruses z given you have a computer of
brand A is equal to 0.22, and we're trying to find what is the probability of having computer brand A and
an infection from virus Z. So to translate our equation, the probability of brand A times the probability of virus Z given brand A is equal to the probability of brand A
and computer virus Z. This should be 0.3
times 0.22 or 0.066. Let's look at the concept
of independence. Two events are independent
if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability that the other event occurs. If two events are not independent
we call them dependent. Let's take two events; driving to work and
it's raining outside. Let's say I always drive to work. If I drive to work, everyday except
the days I'm sick, the probability that I drive
to work is equal to 0.99. If it's raining outside
does that change the probability that
I'm driving to work? Probably not, since
I go to work every day and I drive except for
the days that I'm sick. Therefore, the probability
of me driving to work and me driving to work given
it's raining are the same. Therefore, driving to
work and it's raining outside are independent events. Now, let's slightly
alter this event. Again, I drive to work every day. So unless I'm sick, I'm driving to work. So the probability that
I drive to work is 0.99. Now, it's a category
5 hurricane outside. I'm probably not going
to work that day. So the probability
that I go to work given there's a hurricane outside has
substantially dropped. Now, we see that
these two events are dependent, knowing that it's
a hurricane outside changed the probability
that I'm driving to work. The multiplication rule works somewhat differently
for independent events. When we have two events, A and B and A and
B are independent, then knowing that A happened did not change the probability of B. Or in other words,
the probability of B given A is equal to
the probability of B. This leads to
a simplified version of the multiplication rule. For any two independent
events A and B, the probability of
A and B is equal to the probability of A times
the probability of B. Remember that this used to be the probability of B given A, but since the
probability of B given A is just equal to
the probability of B, we've substituted that in instead of the
conditional formula. This rule can be extended
to the case where there are more than two
independent events. For example, what is the
probability that if you have three kids they're all boys assuming that the probability
of having a boy is 0.5. Think about it? Does having a boy first change the probability
of having a boy second? No. So therefore, these events
are independent events. Because they're
independent, we can say what is the probability
of having a boy, and having a boy, and having a boy? Which is equivalent to
saying the probability of A times the probability of
A times the probability of A. We can substitute in
the word boy for A and we get the probability of
having a boy, and a boy, and a boy is equal to 50 percent times
50 percent times 50 percent, or 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5, and we get 0.125. How does this work? Think about the sample space
for three children. We can have a boy, a boy, and a boy, a boy, a boy, and a girl, and so on. How many times does
three boys happen? Just one out of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
different situations. One out of 8 is equal to 0.125. Note this only works when the probability of A equals 0.5, otherwise, this would turn
into a binomial problem. Where n is the number of trials or in this case
the number of kids, and p is the probability
of a success. When we sample two items
from a population, we can proceed in either
of two ways: We can replace the first item drawn
before sampling the second, which is known as sampling
with replacement. The other option is to
leave the first item out when sampling the second one, this is known as sampling
without replacement. When sampling with replacement each draw is made from
the entire population, so the probability of
drawing a particular item on the second draw does not
depend on the first draw. In sampling with replacement, the draws are independent. In sampling without replacement, the draws are not independent
or they are dependent. So to review our formulas for our addition rule which is
equivalent to or or union, we have the probability
of A or B equal to all of the events
in one plus all of the events in the other
minus the overlap. In the case of
independent events, we have the
probability of A or B. Conceptually the same thing, everybody in one
plus everybody in the other minus the overlap. But here the overlap is
just the probability of A times the probability of B. In mutually exclusive events, again the same concept, probability of A or B
equals everybody in one plus everybody in the
other minus the overlap, but the overlap is zero since they're
mutually exclusive events. You can see the
pattern now through all different types of
probability events. For multiplication we can
do something similar. For multiplication we're dealing with a situation where we have and or the intersection, and the general case the
probability of A and B is equal to the probability of A times the probability of B given A. When we have independent events, the probability of
A and B is equal to the probability of A times
the probability of B, and when we have
mutually exclusive events, the probability of A
and B is equal to zero. Since they don't occur at the same time we can't have an intersection
between the two. For conditional probability, we have that the probability of A given B is equal to the
probability of A and B, and since it's given B, B becomes our denominator and we have the probability of B on
the bottom of our equation. For independent events, remember the definition
of independence. Independence says that given B the probability of
A doesn't change. Therefore, the
probability of A given B is just equal to
the probability of A. For mutually exclusive events, the probability of A given
B doesn't exist, it's zero. Since again, we have no overlap between
the events A and B.
