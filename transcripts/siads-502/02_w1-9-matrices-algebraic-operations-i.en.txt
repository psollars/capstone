Math methods for Data Science,
matrix operations one. In the next two lectures
we're going to talk about algebraic operations that can
be performed on matrices. In this lecture, we'll discuss adding and subtracting matrices, multiplication by a
constant or scalar, matrix-vector multiplication, matrix-matrix multiplication. In the next lecture, we'll talk about outer and inner products, matrix inverse, and transpose, and the trace and
determinant of a matrix. When we add and subtract
matrices we will have two or more
matrices as input, and we will get a
matrix as an output. Addition and subtraction are
performed component-wise. In this example I have
matrix A and matrix B. Both are 3-by-2 matrices and I'm going to
add them together. Since this is done
component by component, let's see what happens when
we add matrix A plus matrix B. I know that since this is
a component-wise operation, I will end up with
a 3-by-2 matrix. In order to add or
subtract the matrices, I'm going to take
the first component, the value in row one, column one, for each of the matrices
and add them together. Then I'm going to do this for every other set of
components in the matrix. 5 plus 4, 2 plus 3, 6 plus 2, 8 plus 1, and 3 plus 3. These calculations will
give me a new matrix. Two by three matrix where
my components are 6, 5, 9, 9, 8, 6, and this gives me my result
of matrix A plus matrix B. Now let's subtract
these two matrices. Again, this is
a component-wise operation, and I'm going to take
each component from matrix A and then subtract
the component for matrix B. So 5 minus 4, 2 minus 3, 6 minus 2, 8 minus 1, 3 minus 3 which will give me again a 3-by-2 matrix with
values negative four, negative one, seven
in my first column, 1, 4 and 0 in my second column. What did you notice about matrix addition and subtraction? You should have noticed that
the matrices have to have the same dimensions in order
to be added or subtracted, because the components need to match from matrix A to matrix B. So in general, if I'm adding
two matrices each 3-by-2, three rows, two columns, I will end up with
a 3-by-2 matrix. Here's the general form for
adding two matrices A and B where A and B are both
three by two matrices. You can see each component
lines up and we have the sum of the components
in our final matrix. Multiplying by a constant is also known as scaling a matrix. If we have a constant Alpha
and a matrix A, we can scale
a by Alpha as follows. We take the constant
alpha and apply it to every single
component of matrix A. So we have Alpha times A1_1, Alpha times A1_2 and so on. Let's do an example and multiply
A by the constant three. Here I'm reminding
you of a formula for multiplying by constants, and here I'm defining matrix A. So in order to calculate
our scaled matrix, I'm taking the constant three
and multiplying it by A, and again this is something
I do component wise, and so Alpha times A
is equal to 3, 6, 24, 15, 18, 9, and I simply
calculated this by taking our constant three and multiplying it by every component within matrix A. Matrix vector multiplication is a
little more complicated. Let's look at a general form first to see where we're going. When we multiply a matrix A, where entries are real numbers and the dimension of m by n, and v as a vector of dimension n, our results are in
n-dimensional vector. Inputs our a matrix and a vector and the output
as a vector. Take a look at
our result matrix and see that we take v1 as the first element and
vector and multiply it by the first element in
the first row of our matrix, plus v2 times the second element
all the way up to however many columns there are in our matrix multiplied by
the last element of the vector. That becomes the first row
of our new vector. Then we can take the second row and multiply by
each element of our vector. To get the second row of
our resulting vector, we do this through
all rows of our matrix. This operation is much
easier to see in practice. Let's multiply
this 3-by-2 matrix and 2 vector to see your resulting matrix
vector multiplication. First, let's write
out what we're doing, we're taking matrix
A times vector v, and so I have
my matrix 1, 2, 8, 5, 6,3 and I'm multiplying
by vector negative 2, 3. In order to calculate
my matrix times my vector, I'm going to take 1 times
negative two plus 5 times 3. Again, this is just taking the first element from the vector multiplied by the first component of the matrix and the first row, and the second element of
the vector multiplied by the second component and
the first row of our matrix, and then I'm going to do
this for the remaining rows. Two times negative
two plus 6 times 3, 8 times negative
two plus 3 times 3, and that will create
our new vector which is the result of our matrix
times our vector. You should see each of
these negative twos are the same since they are the first element
from the vector, and the same thing with
these threes here, those are the second
elements of the vector. Finally, if we complete
this calculation, we should have
negative two plus 15, negative four plus 18, negative 16 plus
9 which will give us a resulting vector of 13, 14. And negative seven. One thing you may have
noticed when we did our matrix vector multiplication, is that another way to think
of this multiplication is to look at the dot products
of each of the rows. So in other words, if I'm looking at the multiplication of
matrix A by vector V, I'm essentially looking at the dot product of each of
the rows of the matrix. Where I'm taking
the elements from the matrix a11 and
a12 times the vector, all the way through each
of the rows of the matrix. Which is equivalent to
exactly what we did to calculate our matrix
by vector multiplication, a11 times the first element
of the vector, plus a12 times the second element of the vector and so on. So you can see that the matrix vector multiplication is really just calculating a dot product for each row of the matrix. When we multiply
two matrices, A and B, where A is in the realm of
real numbers with dimensions M by L and B is in the realm of real numbers with
dimensions L by N, we will get an M by N matrix. The inner dimensions here need to match in order to multiply
two matrices together. Here's how we would write this
in mathematical language. Each element of
the resulting matrix, so our resulting matrix
would be the C matrix. Is the sum of A's row and B's column
component products for all Is where the rows go from value one all the way
up to M and the values J, go from one all the
way to N. Again, it's way easier to see this
if we have an example. In order to translate that math formula into
something that's useful for us, let's take a look at how we would multiply
two matrices together. First, let's take
the first row of element A and the first column of matrix B in order to calculate the first components of matrix C. In order to do this, I'll take a11 times b11 plus a12 times b21. Now to calculate the second
component of our C matrix, I'm going to take
again the first row of matrix A and the second
column of matrix B. Multiply the first values and then add the product
of the second values. You should be seeing a pattern
here. We'll do one more. In order to calculate
this next element of matrix C, I'm going to move down a row in matrix A and use
the first column of matrix B. Then to calculate
the second element and the second row of matrix C, I'll use the same row of matrix A times the second
column of matrix B. One last note on
matrix-matrix multiplication, you'll notice that
this first matrix, matrix A is a three by two
matrix and the second matrix, matrix B is a two by two matrix. What happens when we create a matrix from
this multiplication is we end up with
a three by two matrix. As you can see from
our calculations. Let's say a practical example of matrix-matrix multiplication. Again, we're starting with
a three by two matrix and we're multiplying this
by a two by two matrix. So we should expect to see a three by two matrix
as our final matrix. I will set this up over here. Let's walk through our pattern, I'm going to take
the first row of matrix A and the first column of matrix B and that will create our first element of
our resulting C matrix, 1 times 7 plus 4 times 9. Then let's do the second element. Again, I'm going to have 1 and 4 and I'm going to multiply
1 by 8 and 4 by 10. We'll keep going
through each row of matrix A and multiplying it
by the columns in matrix B. Let's simplify these
calculations and we will get a matrix like this. Finally, to solve for
our A times B matrix, we'll finish our calculations
and get a matrix with 43, 59 and 79 in the first column, 48, 66 and 84 in
the second column. Our next lecture will cover matrix transposition, inverse, outer and inner products, the trace of a matrix and
the determinant of a matrix.
