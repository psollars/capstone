Math methods for
data science, row reduction. Row reduction can be used
to solve sets of equations. It's also directly applicable to eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let's start with
a bit of notation. If I take Ri and
switch it with Rj, that's essentially
switching row i with row j. I can multiply a row by a
constant and make a new row. I can also add two rows together, perhaps row i and j and
replace one of those rows. This notation will help
us as we go through the algebra of
row reduction and matrices. We start with a system of equations that we want to solve. Our goal is to
reduce the rows and the values such that we have essentially
an identity matrix, where we have ones on the diagonal and zeros
on the off-diagonal. You might also see
a notation where a bar is drawn between the matrix that you're solving and the solutions
on the right side. In this case, if we reduce our rows to an identity matrix, our solutions will
be the x equals whatever value is in
the far-right column, y equals whatever values in the far-right column and z equals whatever value is
in the far-right column. Let's see how this works. I have a set of equations, where I'm solving for x and
y. I have coefficients for each of those x values
and coefficients for each of the y values
and the solution. If I translate these set of
equations into a matrix, I'll take the
coefficients from each of the variables and the solutions and create a matrix for
which I am trying to reduce the rows such that I have ones on the diagonal and zeros
on the off-diagonal. I can see that row two, if I multiply row one by negative two and
add them together, I can replace row two
to start with a zero. What does this mean and how
can I write it in notation? I'm going to take
negative two times row one and add it to row two and replace row
two with the new values. I already have that
one on the top left, I don't have to do
anything to it. In order to make
that bottom left a zero, I'm going to perform
these row substitution actions. So let's take negative
two and multiply the first row and add
it to the second row. Negative two times
one is negative two. I'm adding it to the second row. So first off, this first row
doesn't change. So negative two times
one plus two is zero. Negative two times
four is negative eight plus nine, equals one. Negative two times three is equal to negative
six plus five, gives me negative one. Now, I have ones on my diagonals and a zero and
my first off-diagonal. But I need to find
out how to make this upper right a zero. So let's take
negative four times row two and add it to row one
to create a new row one. Again, row two isn't
changing in this math, so let's write it out. Then let's take
negative four times row two. So negative four times zero is zero plus row one
plus one is just one. The next value, negative four
times one is negative four, plus four is zero. Negative one times
negative four is four plus three equals seven. So what this tells
me is that x is equal to seven and Y is
equal to negative one. This is another way to
solve a system of equations and we can go back and prove to ourselves that this is correct. So I'm going to substitute these values back into
one of the equations. X is equal to seven plus
four times y equals three. Seven minus four equals three. Yes, it works. So this is one way using row reduction to solve
a system of equations. Let's look at a more
complicated example with three sets of equations and three variables
that we're solving. If I take the
coefficients of each of these variables and translate
them into a matrix, I'll take all of
my x values, y values, z values and then the solutions, I will have a matrix
with one, two, one, two, negative one, three,
one, negative one, negative four and then a
vector of my solutions, six, one, negative three. Our goal is to make a matrix, that is a three by three
matrix where we're solving for x, y and z. Let's see how we can do
this with row reduction. Here, I've rewritten
our system of equations as a matrix with solutions
on the right side. I see that I already have a
one in the top left corner, but I want to make zeros in the off-diagonals
and so I'm going to start with this first column
and try to make those two rows start with zeros. I can see that if
I take row one and multiply it by negative
two and add it to row two, I can replace row two
and have a leading zero. I also see that if I take row one and multiply it
by negative one, I can add this to row three
and replace row three. So I will do these two actions
simultaneously. So first, I'll take this
negative two times row one and add it to row two. So negative two times
one is negative two plus two is zero. Negative two times
two is negative four plus negative one
equals negative five. Negative two times
one plus negative one is equal to negative three. Negative two times six
is equal to negative 12 plus one equals negative 11. That creates my new second row. The first row on both of these equations here
doesn't change. So I can just write that out. My next step here was
to take negative one times row one and
add it to row three. That would give me zero, one, negative five
and negative nine. I can see here that row three would be perfect if I could just have
this as row two. So I'm going to take row two and switch it with row three. It doesn't really
matter what order these rows or in because they're just different
equations and I can substitute them
wherever I want to. So I'm going to
rewrite this matrix, substituting rows two and three. Two steps I can do next
are creating a zero instead of this two and a zero instead of
this negative five. My first step will be to take
a negative two times row two and add it to row one
and replace my row one. Also, I could take a
five times row two and add it to row three to
then replace my row three. So we'll look at
the algebra and then I'll rewrite this matrix
on the next slide. My first step, negative
two times R2 plus R1, creates my new R1. In either of these steps, my row two isn't changing. So I'm going to go ahead
and translate this over. Now, I'm going to take
negative two times row two and add it to row one. So negative two times zero plus row one
is just a one here. Negative two times
one is negative two plus two is equal to zero. Negative two times
negative five is 10. I'm going to add that to one, that gives me 11. Negative two times
negative nine is equal to 18 plus six, gives me 24. Then my second equation here, five times row two
plus row three. So five times zero is zero
plus zero is equal to zero. Five times one is five, plus negative five is zero. Five times negative five is negative 25 plus negative three, it gives me negative 28. We're getting big numbers here. Five times negative
nine is negative 45 plus negative 11
gives me negative 56. So I'm going to
write this matrix on the next slide and
we're going to keep solving since we're not done yet. Now that I've brought
my matrix over, the next thing I can see
to do is to try to make this negative 28, zero. Well, I could take
negative one-twenty eighth times row three
and replace my row three. So I'm going to do this. Row one and two, don't change, so I can
just copy those over. Now, multiplying
the first value by negative one-twenty eighth
gives me zero, zero, one and then I need
to multiply negative 56 by negative one-twenty
eighth which will give me two. Next, I want to
get rid of this 11 and five and make them zeros. So I'm going to take
negative 11 times R3 plus R1 to replace my row one and I'm also going
to take five times row three plus R2 to replace my R2. Here again, row three
doesn't change, so I'm going to copy that over and then perform
my algebra operations. Negative 11 times R3 plus
R1 is going to give me one, zero, zero and a two. Five times R3 plus R2 is
going to give me a zero, one, zero and one. So there we go. I've
solved my equations. X equals two y equals
one and z equals two. I can go ahead and plug
these back into one of my original equations
and prove that it worked let's pick 2x minus
y minus Z equals one, two times two minus one
minus two equals one. Four minus one minus
two equals one, four minus three equals one. Check. These methods will come in handy when we're calculating eigenvectors in the next lecture.
