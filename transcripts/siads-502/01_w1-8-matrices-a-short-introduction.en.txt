Math methods for data science. Matrices, a short introduction. What is a matrix? A matrix is a two-dimensional array or
table of numbers? The two dimensions refers to the fact
that we have rows and columns. An entire matrix is referred to as
a single capital letter like A or B. We refer to dimensions within the matrix
as M and N or rows and columns. You may also see notations like n and
p when referring to datasets, where n is the number of observations and
p are the parameters or variables. We typically write dimensions as m by n. Here are two matrices, A and B. Let's figure out what the dimensions
are for each of these matrices. For matrix A we have one, two, three rows by one, two columns. So matrix A has dimensions of 3 by 2. Matrix B has dimensions of three rows by three columns. In order to remember which goes first
think of RC like remote control or some other mnemonic device to actually
remember that the rows come first and the columns come second. And then you can align it to
whatever notation you have, whether it's m and n or n and p. When we talk about matrices,
we often say consider the m by n Matrix A, which is in the domain of real
numbers with dimensions m by n. This tells me that I have a matrix called
A which is in the set of real numbers with dimensions m and n, where m
are the rows and n are the columns. Each of the values inside the matrix
are referred to as components and we notate them as aij, where aij is
the value from row i and column j. You might be thinking wait
what happened to m and n. Well, we say that i takes
on the values 1 through m, and j takes on the values 1 through n. So m and n are maximum values of i and
j respectively. What can this look like? So let's consider the 2 by
2 Matrix A in the domain of real numbers with two rows and
two columns, where the i equals 1 components
are all 0 and a21 and a22. These are values in the second row,
first Column and second row second column are 2 and
12 respectively. Here's my standard notation for
an A matrix, and I know from my problem that
the i equals 1 components. So that means the row is 1 are both 0 and the a21, so
the first column second row is 2 and the second column second row is 12. This is how I would apply my rows and columns when I'm given
a problem like this.
