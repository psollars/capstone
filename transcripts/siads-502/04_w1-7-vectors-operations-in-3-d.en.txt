Math methods for
data science vectors, operations in three-dimensions. We can perform operations on vectors of
three-dimensions similar to those that we performed on
vectors of two-dimensions. These include addition, subtraction, scaling,
dot products, length, and we will introduce a new operation cross-products. Remember we can represent our vectors as a set of numbers. In this case with three elements since we're
in three-dimensions. We can also represent
our vectors in square brackets which is more similar to a matrix notation that we'll
discuss in future lectures. If I'm turning into
mathematical notation, I will represent each
of the components as v_1, v_2, and v_3. This notation will translate to all of our
different operations. Again, this is
a very similar lecture to that of operations
in two-dimensions. However, we are extending each of these vectors to
include three elements. Addition and subtraction will sum each of the elements from the vectors to create a new
vector of three-dimensions. Scaling will take a constant a and multiply it by our vector. Our dot product will produce
a single value where we sum the product of each of the components of
the two vectors. We will calculate a cross product which is a new concept
to three dimensions, and we will calculate
the length of our vector. Our addition and
subtraction calculations are just extending our addition, subtraction operations to
more than two dimensions. Here we have two, three-dimensional vectors u and v already drawn on
our Cartesian plane. Let's add them together. In order to add two 3-D vectors, we will add the components
of each of the vectors. Our first component, our x value, will take the x components from each of the two vectors
and sum them, and then we'll do the same
with the y components, and finally the same
with the z components. This will produce
a new vector for us which is the sum
of the two vectors. Our new vector goes; one unit in the x, one unit in the y, and one
unit in the z direction. Now let's subtract
those two vectors. Again, we'll take each
of the components of the vectors and subtract
them to create a new vector. Here I've taken each
of the x values, each of the y values, and each of the z values
and subtracted them to create a new vector; negative three,
three, negative five. This new vector will go negative three units
in the x-axis, three units in the y-axis, and negative five units
in the z-axis. Now let's scale
a three-dimensional vector. We have one vector u, and we're going to scale it
by a factor of negative 1.5. In order to scale, we'll
take this constant and multiply it by each of the elements or
components in our vector. Negative 1.5 times negative one, negative 1.5 times two, and negative 1.5
times negative two. This will give us a new vector; 1.5, negative three, and three. This new vector will go
1.5 units in the x-axis, negative three units
in the y-axis, and three units in the z-axis. You can see when we scaled
by a negative number, it flipped the direction
of our vector. The dot product of two, three-dimensional vectors
will produce a single number. Here again we have
two vectors u and v, and we will find the dot product
between the two vectors. The dot product sums
the products of each of the components
of the two vectors. That is, if we multiply
the x components, the y components, and the z components and
sum them together, we'll produce the dot product. In this example, let's take the x components from
the u and v vector, negative one times two
plus the y components, two times negative one
plus the z components, negative two times three. This will give us negative
two plus negative two plus negative
six, or negative 10. So the dot product of these
two vectors is negative 10. The cross product is a
little more involved than some of the operations
we've seen before, but the algebra is
no more complicated. Say we have two vectors u and v, and we want to find
the cross product. In order to find
the cross product, we will create a new vector. This is an instance
where following the formula is going to be
your best path forward. So let's take each of
the elements that are described in
this formula and write them out so that we can
perform the algebra. So I have room to show
you all the steps, I'm going to separate
these out into their individual
elements x, y, and z. So to solve for the x element
of the new vector, I'm going to take
two times three. That's the element two
from the u vector, and the element three
from the v vector, and I'm going to subtract
off the element three from the u vector times the element
two from the v vector. This should give me six
minus two, or four. So our new x component is four, let's solve for the y component
of this new vector. The y component of
this new vector should take
the third element from the u vector times
the first element from the v vector minus
the first element from the u vector times the third
element from the v vector. This will give us negative four minus negative three or
negative four plus three, which will give us
the value negative one. So our y element here
is negative one. Finally to solve
for our z element, we're going to take
the first element from the u vector times
the second element from the v vector and subtract off the second element from the u vector times the first
element from the v vector. This will give us one minus
four or negative three. Giving us our third element
of negative three. Our final vector then from the cross product of
these two vectors u and v will be four, minus one, minus three. Which gives us a vector of
four units in the x direction, negative one unit
in the y direction, and negative three units
in the z direction. Finally let's look at calculating the length for
a three-dimensional vector. Say we have the vector u, and we want to
calculate the length. We will take the square of
each element of the vector, sum them and then
find the square root. For this vector u, let's
square each of the elements, negative one squared plus two squared plus negative
two squared, and then calculate
the square root. In this case we have the square
root of 1 plus 4 plus 4, which gives us the square root
of 9 which is equal to 3. So we have just
calculated the length of the vector u as equal to three.
