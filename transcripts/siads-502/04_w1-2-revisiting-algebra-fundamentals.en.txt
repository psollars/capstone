Math Methods for Data Science. Revisiting Algebra: Fundamentals. Most of this lecture is to
get us on the same page in terms of notation
and definitions. Let's first talk about numbers. Natural numbers, numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are represented by a script N. Integers extend to the negative numbers but
are all whole numbers, like negative 3, negative 2, negative 1, and so on. They also include
natural numbers. These numbers are
represented by a script Z. Rational numbers, those that terminate, numbers
like five-thirds, 1.5, 0.125, negative 4 are
represented by a script Q. Real numbers, numbers
like negative 1, square root of 2, e, and Pi, those that can continue on in their decimals are represented by script R. Finally,
complex numbers, those including
imaginary numbers like i are represented by a script C. One thing to
note is that all of these numbers are nested
within other sets of numbers. For instance,
the natural numbers or script N are nested
within integers, which are nested within
rational numbers, which are nested
within real numbers, which are nested within
complex numbers. So I can say that the set of real numbers includes
rational numbers, integers, and natural numbers. Variable names. A lowercase x is a general name for an
unknown in equations. It's also a function's input. We might see notations
such a f of x. Letters like i, j, k, l, m, and n, lowercase, are names
commonly used for integers. Letters like a, b, c, and d, again lowercase, are typically
used to notate constants. Constants are just numbers. Random variables and
probability are often denoted by capital
letters like capital X. A lowercase letter
with an arrow over the top is a common
notation for a vector. Capital letters like A and B are common notations
for matrices. Let's also talk about
terminology for math equation. We've all seen math equations but let's talk about
the components. For instance, this math equation
is made up of two terms. The first term, a
times b times c, plus the second term, d times e, is equal to 0. On the left side of the equation, we talk about this
as an expression. Then taken as a whole, we have an entire equation. Let's talk about
Cartesian planes. A two-dimensional
visualization of a number line is also
called a Cartesian plane. Here we have a number
line representing integers from negative
four to four. The Cartesian plane is just a two-dimensional
representation of this with an x-axis on the horizontal
and a y-axis on the vertical. We can represent a point P by two coordinates on
the Cartesian plane, P_x and P_y, which gives a coordinate for
the x-axis and the y-axis. A vector is represented also in a similar format
with two components, v of x and v of y, representing an x
and y coordinate. Let's represent points and
vectors on a Cartesian plane. A point starts from
the origin and has coordinates in
the x and y direction. In this case, a point P has
the coordinates negative two, negative two, where
we go minus two on the x-axis and minus
two on the y-axis. If we draw a vector, it can start anywhere
but will always be the same in terms of
magnitude and direction. For instance, vector 1
with the components two, two can start at the origin per se and go two units in
x and two units in y. We could also start
anywhere on the plane, for instance, a point of x equal to 0 and y
equal to negative 3. As long as we go up two units in x and
over two units in y, we have the same vector. In this case, vector 2. Let's draw a last
vector, vector 3, in which we could start
again at the origin and go minus four units in x
and up one unit in y. There are several other
fundamental processes of algebra that if you
are not familiar with, you should find some resources
to refresh your memory. These include
algebraic properties like the associative,
communicative, and distributive properties, factoring and
quadratic factoring.
