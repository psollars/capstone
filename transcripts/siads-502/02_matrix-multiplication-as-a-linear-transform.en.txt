Welcome back to math methods for
data science. In this video,
we're going to talk about matrix multiplication as a linear transform. So first off, let's recall
the properties of a linear transform, T. A transformed T is linear if both T of cx, tx is some factor and c is some scaler, equals c times T of x. That is when you multiply
the input by some scalar, it multiplies the output
by the same scalar. Additionally, T of x plus y, here x and y are vectors,
should equal T of x plus T of y. That is the transform applied to
the sum of two vectors is the sum of the transform applied to
each vector individually. Now, matrix multiplication
satisfies both of these properties. Let A be an n by m matrix. So A then maps from Rm to Rn because of A is an n by m matrix, It maps an m dimensional vector
Into an n dimensional vector. Let's check that matrix multiplication
satisfies both of these properties. So first we want to confirm
that if we multiply A by some scalar transform the vector that we could just scale the output. So, A, recall is just an n by m matrix. We're going to call the label
entries a11 to a1m on top. So the first thing to see is the row and
the second one is the column. So then on the bottom, it's an1 to anm, okay. And we're multiplying that
by c times the matrix x. We'll c times x is just cx1, cx2 cx2, cxm, okay, and what is this equal? While the first entry we take the dot product of the first row with this vector, the first entry is going
to be c time's a11 times x1 plus c time's
a12 times X2 plus and so on so forth to the last entry. C time's a1m times xm all right, and the we're going to do this and then the last of the outputs just skip it. But we'll get a sense for what's going on here is going to be the
last row times this column, which is C. An1 x1 plus cam2 times x2 so on so forth they'll see anm times xm. Right, so that's the output of
the left hand side A times cx. Okay, but notice this is
also the output of the right hand side because we can just filter
the c out of this entire thing and we just get C times the vector
a11 x 1 plus dot dot dot. Sorry c is out there a1m times x m and then on the bottom, we're going to get an1 x1 plus anm times Xm. And we noticed that this factor here, what's inside of this
factor is simply a times X. This here is a times X. We can see, that's what you get
when you multiply the first. The first one is the first row of
a times a vector X and so on so forth. Last one is the first, the bottom
row of a dotted with the vector X. So we've checked this first property. Okay, let's check the second property. It basically follows the same way. If we take our matrix a 11, a1m, an1, anm and
multiply it by X ,we get that up there, we already saw that If we multiply this by X plus y will the vector
x plus y is going to be x1 plus y1 x2plus y2 2x m plus ym, okay. So if we multiply he's the first
row it's going to be big here. It's going to be all right. A11 times x1 plus y1 plus a12 times x2 plus y2 and so on and so forth down to a1m times x1 plus y1. And we get the same going down I'll just put the last one here is an1 x1 plus x1 y1 plus one so forth anm times xm plus ym, okay. And now the thing to notice is
that we can break this matrix up into two separate matrices. Where the top row just equals
will pull all the X terms and all the white terms will group
the X terms together and the Y terms together and
so this is going to equal. Well, if we look at the X terms, that's a11 x 1 plus a12 x2 and that's a1m x m. Okay, and then there is a plus here. This we're still in the first row. A11 y1 plus a12 y2 plus 2a 1m ym, okay. And each, entry and this is going to
be the same down on the bottom. You can separate the X terms and
the y terms together. And the thing to know here is
that the first X terms is equal to the first entry in a X and the y terms
is equal to the first entry here in ay. And so this first term is just
equal to the first term of ax plus the first term of ay,
and it will be the same down. So that confirms that matrix
multiplication also satisfies this second property that the result of
the sum of two vectors is the some of the results of applied
to each factor separately. Knowing this can help us understand
how matrix multiplication works. So by property one We know that with C equals
to zero that any zero m vector must be transformed to the zero and
vector. So if we take a times any zero vector are you better give us zero vector back. And this is this has to be true
because the function if we think of multiplying by a s t t of zero,
has to be equal to zero. Because if we multiplied the output if
we put if it was not equal to zero, then we could say let C equals zero and t of c time's X has to be
equal to C times, T of X. And because she is zero, this equals zero here and so t applied to zero has to be equal to zero,
okay. Another cool property is
that if you take any line, it maps to another line. So let's say we take a line X plus cy. So we're thinking of C
belonging to the real numbers. So we have some vector X and
some vector y. And we're just tracing out this line here we can multiply y by a big number? Get something up here by a small number. Get something down here is we're
tracing out this line X times y. And if we apply a to it, so
let's just write it as our t X plus c y. This has gotta equal by the first rule,
it equals t of x. So by the second role t of C y. And now applying the first rule, this equals t of X plus c times t of y, and we see that this here is a line,
right? So t of X will just draw
a picture here t of x, some vector and t of y is some vector and c just if we make c big we
get something out here. If we make c small we
get something out there. But again it traces a line. So matrix multiplication maps, lines, to other lines. Also it maps parallel lions,
two parallel lines. So Parallel lines. Y is that. Well, if two lines are parallel,
we can they differ at some point. So let's draw one line is C X and the other one as c x plus y. So this is a line cx is a line shifts along with x here and c x plus y you just shift by a vector y here and then you take the same twist to it. So these this gives us parallel lines and again we can see that
the result is parallel lines because t of c x equal c t of x and t of c X plus y equals
c t of x plus t of y. And so in the end, the difference between
these two lines is just this t of y and each of these maps to,
a line again that ships with t of x. So now we have lines. This is just t of X, this line here and then we shift by some t of y and we get this other line
here t of y plus TX. Now things get a little funky. If either X or
Y maps to zero of why maps to zero. These lines become the same line. And if x maps to zero, these lines in
fact, become a point instead of a line. So let's see some pictures of this. So let's say we have our matrix a here. So this is a matrix and
we're imagine, is a linear transform. So if we take X equals,
say this red vector here so that would be X equals 12, okay. And we multiplied by a then we're
going to get this blue vector here, so it's going to translate over here. So a of 12 is going to be equal to negative one 2.5 and we can indeed check that. This is the case eight
times 12 equals on the top. We have one times one, it's one negative. One times two negative, two on the bottom. We have 0.5 times one, which is 0.5 and
then we have one times two, which is two slide indeed
equals we thought it should. And so this red vector here after
the transform becomes his blue vector. Now, if we take that red vector times two,
then we get this yellow vector and this should, when we multiply it by
a should result in the blue vector by two, which is his green vector here
because these two points on a line and input, they should also be on the line and
the output. And if we do the multiplication,
we can see that that indeed happens. So the outcome of a applied to 24 is
going to be minus 25 which is this point here to get a better sense for
what these linear transforms do. We could look at more fancy shapes here. We have a square. I'm drawn the square. The initial square is just from,
one one two one, minus one twe, minus one minus one, two, one,
minus one and back again. So you go around the square here and you can see that this I'll
label the points here, just a B, C, D and
a then maps to this point here and be maps to this point here,
this is C and this is the result of D. So I guess call this prime. Okay, so you see that this initial
square maps to this Rambis and the points are rotated and then stretched. Okay, so you take the square, you're
going to rotate it a little bit, and then you stretch it out and
you get the resulting diamond. Notice the parallel lines say parallel,
right. So AC and AD or
both parallel before and after. Similar with the other set and
straight line stay straight. So we're just rotating and
stretching in this bottom chart. Here we also start with the same square
will label the points again A B C D. But now,
something slightly different happens. So, the point A maps to
a here be maps here C and D. This one here the square flipped
it flipped like in a mirror. And then after it flipped,
it rotated about 25 degrees. And then it got stretched again. Okay, so it rotated, flipped, rotated and
stretched in this picture here. Notice again straight lines
map to straight lines. Parallel lines map two parallel lines. A few more fancy objects here we have octagon and we see where they go. And again in the top
picture things are flipped. So this point A here maps to A and B maps to B here. So Octagon is flipped and then rotated and then stretched and similarly down here. A maps to A, B maps to B, okay. So here things are flipped, rotated and stretched again. Okay, so that's what these linear
transforms tend to do they flip potentially rotate potentially and
stretch potentially. In general, if we have some subset of points car in and
we'll have some matrix or linear transform that
that's an N by N Matrix. And then we can look at the image of
the set s through the transform and will say that a point is
in the image of the set. If it corresponds to some point
in the pre image were you then apply the matrix multiplication,
okay. And in general here,
if you have some figure, which is your s,
then a of s and basically flip, rotate and stretch your image. So it could be something
like this when you get done. But parallel lines are going to
map to parallel lines. Straight lines map to straight lines as
before you can't make anything curvy or or things like that. Okay, great. So that's what I wanted to
talk about in this video, which is again interpreting
a matrix as a linear transforms. So to understand matrices and the properties of matrices we can look
at them through linear transforms. In the next video, we're going to
talk about some properties of the new transforms and how these translate
into properties of the matrix.
