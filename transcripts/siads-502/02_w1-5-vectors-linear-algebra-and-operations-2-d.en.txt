Math methods for
Data Science vectors, linear algebra, and
operations in two-dimensions. Many different algebraic
operations can be performed on vectors
including addition, subtraction, scaling, dot products, length,
and cross-products. All of these vector operations
have specific formats. Addition and subtraction
will produce vectors when adding two or more vectors
of two dimensions. In this case, most
of our notation will include a u vector and v vector, representing two
2-dimensional vectors. In addition, subtraction we will create a new
vector where we add the components together from each of these two vectors
or subtract them. Scaling, where we're
taking a constant a and multiplying it by vector u, which is equivalent
to multiplying the components by the letter a. The dot product will
produce a single value. Dot products are represented by a dot in between two vectors. The length of a vector, again represented by placing the vector inside of two bars, is equivalent to
the square root of the sum of each of the components
of the vectors squared. We will also talk
about cross-products, but only for vectors of
three or more dimensions. Instead of looking at vectors in terms of mathematical notation, we can think of vectors as just a set of numbers in a list. Instead of writing them
in mathematical notation, I can write them like this. Either represented
as points were in the coordinate system or I can put them inside of brackets, and represent them stacked
on top of one another. These are two-dimensional
vectors or two vectors. A two vector has a size of two, basically telling
us that there are two elements inside this vector. What would a one
vector look like? We don't typically
differentiate one vectors from numbers since a one vector
would have one element, and therefore just be
equivalent to a single number. An n vector would
have n elements. So a three vector or a seven vector would have
three or seven elements. These would just continue
stacking numbers on top of one another to represent
this particular vector. Another unfortunately
confusing part about vectors is
how we index them. Indexing vectors refers to how I should refer to each of
the elements within the vector. How should I talk about
the value negative 2.4? Well, since negative 2.4 is the first element
in the vector v, I could call this v1. To refer to any element
or component of a vector, we can use the notation v sub i where i is the position of the component from i
equals one to n. Meaning, this first component
here starts at one, and the second component
would be two. When we talk about computers
and indexing vectors, computers typically start
from i equals zero. It's just important to note that there is
a difference between computer indexing and mathematical
indexing for vectors. We will stick with a mathematical
indexing for vectors, but do be aware of this
in future courses. Let's see how some of these
operations work with vectors. Say we have two
2-dimensional vectors, u and v. Let's draw
them on our plane. Here I've drawn both vectors, u and v. When I want
to add these vectors, I follow the format given. So I take the x components
of each vector, six from u and five from v, and I sum them, and then I take the y components 4 plus 2. This creates a new vector, (11,6). You can see when we sum these two positive vectors
that we create a third vector that
splits the difference between them and
increases the magnitude. Let's take these same two
vectors and subtract them. We will take vector
u subtract vector v. This is equivalent to taking the x
components from vector u, and subtracting 6 minus 5, and the y components 4 minus 2 to produce a new vector, (1,2). This new vector is
the difference between u and v. Now let's look at scaling a vector where
we have a constant a, let's say 1.5, and we're scaling this vector u
by that constant. In order to scale, we will take the constant and multiply it by each
of the components. Here 1.5 times 6, and 1.5 times 4 producing
a new vector, (9, 6). This vector will be
the same direction, but a greater magnitude
than the original. Dot product between two vectors, u and v will produce
a single number. In order to calculate
the dot product, we will take each of
the components from each vector and
multiply them together, and then sum them
across components. In this case, we have
two vectors u and v, the same vectors
we've been working with and we'll multiply their components and then sum them to find our dot-product. I'll take the x components from each vector six and
five and multiply them, and then sum the product
of the y components. In this case, I have 30 plus 8 giving me a dot product between these two vectors of 38. Let's calculate the length
of the vector u. In this case, we have
a two-dimensional vector u, and we're going to plug in our components into our formula. So to calculate the length of u, we will take
the x component squared, plus the y component squared, and the square root of the sum. So here we have
six squared or 36, plus four squared or
16, all square rooted, gives us the square root of 52, which you can leave as
the square root of 52, or you can solve this
into decimal form. Or you could simplify the square root as
2 times the square root of 13. This is the representation of
the length of the vector u.
