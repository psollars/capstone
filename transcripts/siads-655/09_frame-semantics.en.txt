So far we've talked about
semantic roles and predicates. You may have had a sense that predicates
may be related to each other. We could try to think about this and
what's known as frame semantics, which tries to capture more structured
information about predicates and the arguments. Let's look at a particular example. Let's think about what we know
in a particular situation here. The travelers spent a few hours on blank. If we say the traveler spent a few
hours on land, this often applies say that the travelers were out to sea or
were on a particular vacation. If you say that the travelers
spent a few hours on the ground, this would often apply say that we
were flying and that we were grounded, the plane had landed and
we were exploring on the ground. The idea behind frame semantics is that
there's often types of information, say real world knowledge or
background information that we as readers infer naturally
from reading these sentences. Semantic frame try to capture this. We can think of a frame almost like
a knowledge structure that builds in information about stereotypical events. We can think about who is involved or
what happens or when does it happen? And many NLP systems try to
use frame semantics to bridge the gap from what's expressed in a context
to what's assumed in the real world. Frames can even be cued by a single word. To give another set of examples. Let's think about what we can
infer from the following sentence. Priya gave Miguel $100 for
a tip or ransom or an allowance. And each of these cases,
this creates a different type of frame for what we might know if Priya
gave Miguel $100 for a tip. This suggests that Miguel is doing
some service for Priya say a waiter. And this is a quite a generous tip. If Priya gave me about $100 for ransom, the suggested Miguel is involved
in some sort of kidnapping event. If Priya gave Miguel $100 for allowance, this is just that maybe
Priya is Miguel's parent. There are many other nouns that
we can place here such as bounty, refund, honorarium,
tuition retainer, bonus or rent. If you think about each one of these,
we often evoke several different types of background knowledge that are often just
assumed from changing one single word. These different examples are cases where
a frame is cued by a particular word. One of the most famous frames is
what's known as the restaurant frame popularized by Schank
& Abelson back in 1975. Here, let's give an example. She went to a restaurant,
he ordered a meat and three and a drink. He asked the waiter for the bill and left. If we read this sentence,
it seems like a quite a regular sentence. If I asked you did she eat the food? You would probably say yes. However, nowhere in this frame does it
express that she is actually eaten. Instead, he's ordered the meat and three,
and then he has paid the bill and left. In fact, it doesn't even say
that he's paid the bill. It says he's asked the waiter for
the bill. And we assume much of the semantic
frame for what happens in a restaurant. Because of our background knowledge
about what people do there. Frames reflect these commonalities
by thinking about the event and the types of arguments that they have. So for example, if you have Esther made
a cake, the cake was cooked by Esther, Esther's baking of the cake or
the cake preparation took time. We can think about in each of
these cases that a frame is cued, the same frame is cued by these verbs. That the cooking creation frame. Esther also plays a similar role here, the cook and we can think about
the cake itself as the produced food. Unlike some of the earlier examples
from the previous segment, we can think about frames as
generalizing across multiple predicates. Much like say how a sunset in
wordnet reflects multiple senses. Here a frame may be
cued by multiple words. If you try to compare PropNet to
FrameNet that we could think again, here's prop net for the verb increase. We have our two arguments that correspond
to the proto role and the proto argument, as well as the verb specific roles. In FrameNet, we could think about frames
as being cued by lexical units rather than particular verb senses. Say, a cooking event versus
the PropNet frame for increase. And we have arguments that are general,
say, cook or produced food. Let's take a look at the cooking event. Here, we'll have lexical units, and these lexical units are words that
are going to signal the frame's presence. So for the cooking event we have
words like bake or cook cooking. We also have words like roasting or
to whip up something. Within this frame we
have core frame elements. This is cook and produce food. And these are the core elements
of the frame that are typically present in all instances. The cook is the person
that produces the food and the produced food is a result
of the cook's effort. But there are many other frame elements to
the cooking event, such as the container that holds the food or the degree
at which the oven event occurs or the cooking event occurs,
where the heating instrument itself or the ingredients that are used
in the cooking event. The manner in which the cooking
event was performed. There are many other frame elements for
cooking event. And as regular people in the real world,
we often can enumerate many of these types of frame elements as background knowledge,
if we think about it, they're often implicitly assumed in
the types of events we describe. I should also point out that
lexical units aren't just verbs, although we've just described many verbs. So for example, on the change
in a position on a scale frame, we could think about there are verbs
like increase, advanced jump or slide. But they're nouns like escalation or
growth or shift, or adjectives like accelerated or growing, and even adverbs
like increasingly, that typically signal this frame being evoked that something
is changing along the scale. Within frame that frames
themselves can be related. If we think about cooking event,
this frame often inherits many of the properties and
arguments from other types of events. So in this case cooking event
inherits from the apply heat frame. Apply heat itself inherits
from other types of frames, such as an activity frame. Or unintentionally affect frame. There are other types of relationships
beyond these inherited such as apply heat causes something to absorb heat. And there are sub frames such as activity
has activity stop or activity start. All these create a rich structure in which
we can understand the common sense of the world. Through minimal queues, helping natural language processing
bridge to the real world. Fragment itself is available
in many languages. And these are often cross linked to
some degree much like the universal dependencies for dependency parsing. We can think about looking at frames and
common sense and to some degree we can even look at cross
lingual information as to what is assumed in different situations. Framerate is an ongoing project. And there are many different
words trying to do these frames, semantics and real text.
