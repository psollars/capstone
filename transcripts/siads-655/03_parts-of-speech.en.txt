In thinking about
the structure of language. Let's take a look at one common aspect
that people look at parts of speech. I'd like to start about thinking
what exactly is a part of speech and maybe something you've already learned? But let's think if we could
get some intuition for what parts of speech are here,
let's look at an example. I made you a blank, but I ate it. What might fill this? You might think of
the language model itself and think about what words come in, say,
cookie or sandwich or smoothie. But if you think about other types of
words, we would probably say that jump or bright or even easily do not work here
in this context, why is that here? We could say that one criteria for words is that they have some
valid use in the same context. Here, a context forms a constraint,
and we'd like to look for regularity in which types of words
can fill a particular context. In practice, morphology can
also help to find categories. Here let's look at examples of
different morphology is for five words Cookie Kim wah, sneeze, jog and the we can see whether these words might
take the Suffolk's s here often to indicate plural so
we can have cookies or key Moi's. We know that sneezes or
jogs we can think about the suffix for ED to indicate the past tense of a verb. In this way, we can see that cookies or
keen wad probably does not make sense, except in some very unusual circumstances. Unlike that, those sneezed or
jogged sounds perfectly fine. For though we can see that it could
no longer take the plural ending nor the past tense ending. Finally, we can think about the I N G for
participle forms. Sneezing and jogging sound fine, whereas
the other three words don't work well. These morphological surfaces could help
us think about which kinds of words might form a similar category. You might also note that
there are exceptions, so you might say that eat eats eight and
eating. We might think that
the morphology differs. This is an exception to the rule. So unlike this very sad cat,
you cannot eat a cookie. You have to eat a cookie. But these exceptions to the rule, these irregular verbs do not
break our morphology rules. We can also think that there
may be some ambiguity here. We have waffle waffles, the plural where
you have multiple waffles and we also have the verb form of waffle, so waffled and
waffling may works in these cases, however we can think about now is adverbs in this
ambiguity is still not violating these. So what exactly is a part of speech? Here we can think about A part of speech
is really a category where all the words in that category appear in very
similar syntactic context, much like we saw before with
our morphological rules. They perform similar types of
functions and sentences, and they have similar
morphological transformations. A part of speech really is
a distribution over these properties. There may be some exceptions to the rule,
but by and large the category holds for
all the words in it. English actually has
eight parts of speech. They're commonly recognized. Let's take a look at them here
example of now towns, and these typically will describe people,
places or things or ver black mounds. We also have verbs, which describe actions
and processes that we might perform adjectives that describe properties or
qualities of nouns. Adverbs that mostly modify verbs
in terms of their quality but also can modify adjectives or
even verbal phrases. We have determined like a and that marked the beginnings of noun
phrases pronounce such as you, me and it. Propositions that indicates spatial or
temporal relationships between entities. And conjunctions that join clauses and
sentences like and if or, as. I will say,
that new words appear all the time so that words may be slotted into the one
of these parts of speech categories. So, for example, to look at a few
recent words from the past year. They can think about Deep Fake or
Inspo orm you'd even Zoomer. All of these words end
up in the noun category. Similarly, we have verbs like a magnetized
self, isolate, micro target or even spilled the tea. We can deal with new adjectives like all
dressed offi or see us and adverbs like High Key, which is the opposite of
low key for these parts of speech. The fact that new words
appear in them all the time. What makes them called what's known as
open class categories here we expect that these categories will grow over
time we can contrast this with, say, the other four parts of speech like
pronouns or determine er's English Rarely, if ever,
adds these new words to these categories. We would call these closed
classes of parts of speech. I will say, if you have a new word and
you don't know the part of speech, it is out of vocabulary guessing,
and now is often a useful indicator. As we typically invent. New now is frequently for
things that we say invent directly or for concepts that need a new name. The parts of speech that we've just
seen for English aren't universal, and languages, in fact, can differ quite
a bit in their parts of speech. So, for example, some languages like Kesha
don't differentiate between now owns and adjectives for the most part, or languages like Tongan don't differentiate
between now owns and verbs. Some languages actually have
very few adjectives overall and choose to describe words using other types
of parts of speech and constructions. Other languages have different properties
for opening closed classes, for example, and Japanese verbs and
adjectives are largely closed, and new ways of describing processes come from
other parts of speech I will say that these claims depend on how you
actually define a part of speech and this actually open area of
linguistics as a field. So if you're interested in this, there are
some interesting works from NLP trying to create a universal part of speech tag set. They would let us look at
languages across the field and try to understand how they're
different parts of speech. Very one of the main challenges within NLP
is trying to resolve what is the part of speech for a particular word in a context. We'll call this task part
of speech tagging and typically is going to try to result break
this ambiguity through some sort of natural language processing technique. So here's an example of I will
make you a cookie as a sentence. It seems fairly straightforward
with one interpretation, but if you look at the types
of parts of speech, we could see that I may be a proper
noun or it could be a personal pronoun. Will, it could be a modal verb or another. Now you could think the document you
make for after you pass away make itself could have three different
parts of speech you on Leah pronoun. Thankfully, a could have many different
possible interpretations, and Cookie itself is just announced with
just a simple sentence of six words and just these parts of speech. We have 72 different possible
part of speech labeling for this one sentence alone, and there may
be more that are possible in practice. This creates considerable ambiguity that
natural language processing techniques will have to resolve. Knowing the parts of speech of a sentence
can actually help us resolve some of the ambiguity and syntax as well. Let's look at one example
from an earlier lecture. British Left Waffles on
Falklands There's some ambiguity on how to interpret this sentence. If we have, say, one part of speech
labeling here, the interpretation is that the British is the subject, and they're
doing leaving of waffles on the Falklands. However, another part of speech
interpretation is that British left is itself a noun phrase and
that the verb here is waffles, indicating that while the left is doing
the waffling by resolving the ambiguity, the parts of speech we conform
downstream tasks like syntax and parsing toe understand how these
words relate to each other. Voice assistants and speech technologies
often rely on parts of speech as well for pronunciation. So, for example,
thinking about now owns adverbs. Often, announcer verbs differ
in how they pronounced. She addresses the crowd versus
I forgot the addresses. He patrolled the confines. She confines the cat. My speaker has a defect. The spies will defect soon. Object oriented programming. The lawyers object to this. I got an upgrade. She should upgrade her seat. When you hear a verb or renown
mispronounced by your voice assistant, perhaps you can think next time. How might this have been
interpreted differently? With a different part of speech, you may find that these mistakes often
lead to downstream pronunciation errors. As a result, part of speech tagging
is quite useful in practice, even though it seems
like a very simple task.
