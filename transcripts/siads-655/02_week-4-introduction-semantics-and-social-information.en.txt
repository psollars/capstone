Welcome to Week 4. We've talked a little
bit about syntax and a little bit
about word meaning. Let's go a bit deeper and
broader in the Week 4 content and talk about semantics
and the kinds of social information that
we can get from text. Let's look at what's going
on in this conversation. Here, the person on
the left he said, "Do you want to think
from Zingerman's?" The person on the right
he said, "Tom's new job." Person on left he said, "Do you need silverware too?" The person on the right he
said, "Nope, I'm all good." What can we learn about
this conversation? Well, for one, it looks like
someone is ordering food. If you've been to
Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, you might know that Tom's new job is in fact a Turkey Reuben. However, this requires
some understanding of what is going on and
what this entity is. We might be able to
pick up on this, say, by looking at silverware
and knowing that silverware cue's some
eating activity, or that Zingerman's
is a restaurant, and that you might order
food at a restaurant. We might also notice
a few other things. For example, the
person on the left uses proper punctuation
and capitalization. The person on the right doesn't
use periods, and in fact, adopts a more
informal tone saying, "Nope, I'm all good." This might suggest a certain type of social relationship between these two people texting each other. What do you
think it might be? In Week 4, we'll try
to tease out both of these types of tasks
using questions asking, how do we understand what's
the semantics or meaning of this and how we can recover this type of
social information. If you think about the
meaning of a sentence, we can say that semantics
is going to describe, well, the meaning of the
words and the sentences beyond trying to ground it
in the real-world itself. We can think about what
do particular words mean? What kind of entities that
phrases referring to? For example, understanding that Tom's new job is
in fact not a job, but a Turkey Reuben. Or what kind of event
is taking place? Understanding that
this interaction is describing an
ordering food event. We could also think
about this social information and
trying to recover it. What can we infer through the fact that one person uses punctuation and
another doesn't? Or that there's more
colloquial phrases? How can we use this type of social information to
study society itself? We can look at how to
use social information, semantics, discourse, and different types
of applications. We'll look at all of
these together in Week 4.
