Let's take a look at semantics. We can start from a simple
example that we looked at before, asking what the words mean? Here, we can think about the word coyote. We could potentially try to ask what
coyote means by trying to count all of its co occurrences in a vector. And create a V dimensional vector where
V is the length of our vocabulary. Here we could say that these co
occurrences reflect what coyote means in practice. We might even try to dimensionally reduce
this down to say the two dimensional vector like we did with where at tech or
with L LSA. But we might also look
at a different approach, which is to go to the dictionary. And here we can see that coyote
has two different meanings, one, the small canine, or
to the person that smuggles immigrants. These might both be reflected
in the count vectors. And we'd like to understand how
do we actually capture this and model it effectively in practice. What this is really describing at
the semantic level is what's known as polysemy. Where a single lemma here coyote could
have multiple distinct meanings. And we'll call these senses, implicitly
complicates NLP to a great degree. In fact, ambiguity is one of
the fundamental challenges for NLP. Let's look at this in practice. As the baddest snowboarder around, she combined a wicked quad cork
with a sick misty flip to win. This probably sounds
pretty positive actually. If you think about some of the words
describing different aspects, so bad, sick, wicked. You might go to the dictionary to say,
well, what did these mean here? Imagine that you're an NLP system and
you could read these definitions. And say well, bad means failing
to reach an acceptable standard, sick means spiritually morally unsound or
wicked means morally very bad. However, we probably make
the interpretation of the second sense. Also in Merriam Webster,
that bad means good or great or sick means outstandingly or
amazingly good. And wicked means going beyond
reasonable predictive limits. These are essentially antonymic
readings of the same words. And completely reverse our
interpretation of the sentence. Do get a correct interpretation of the
semantics of the sentence requires us to figure out what exactly is intended by
these words which are heavily ambiguous. Humans actually have no problem figuring
out which meanings are present. So for example,
thinking about one particular word. If we say they really serve red meat. This would be a something about the meat
you would offer of the menu verses he served as a U.S. ambassador to Norway. This is not someone not being
served on the menu, but serving in a particular role. Or he might have served his time. Here something that has
been incarcerated.. These different meanings of
serve are antagonistic and can't be read in the same way. With just a minimal context, we have no
problem making the correct interpretation. Word senses can be related
to each other as well. So for example, I'm going to the bank. You might think that there's
only a few meanings of bank. It could be that you're going to
the sloping land besides the water, like the river bank. You could be going to a financial
institution that accepts deposits. And these are probably two of
the more common definitions of bank. But it could just be a loan Richard pile,
like an earth bank, or it could be a bank of GPU's something
like a similar objects in a row. Could be supply reserve
items a blood bank, which is an extension
of that second sense. Thinking about a financial institution for
things other than financing. There's even the ninth sense which is the
building where bank too does its business. You could be going to the bank yet not
actually going to do business at the bank. Or it could be a flight maneuver, which is
reminiscent of what a maneuver would have to be, should you be running next to
a bank to make a long sloping turn. These sensors are related to
each other to some degree, yet often distinct in other ways. And words may have many
different such senses. In fact, if you think about one serve,
it has 15 different meanings. Here these are the meanings
shown in wordnet, which is one of the common
sense repositories used in NLP. Some words are even more polysemous. Famously line has over 30 meanings and
even more verb meetings as well. Trying to disambiguate between
these two can be very challenging. You might ask, do we need all 30? How would we even tell if
the two are synonymous actually? So how would we tell if two senses
are distinct or actually the same? What are the ways to do this is to create
a context that evokes both meetings. This is known as zeugma. And to see if a single sense
can be applied in both, it's going to encompass both
interpretations of the sentence. So for example, you might ask
which flights serve breakfast? Here, the flight is delivering food. It says definition of serve, or
does Midwest Express serve Philadelphia? Here serve as offering service to
that particular airport, okay? Combine these two in zeugmatic expression. Does the Midwest Express serve
breakfast and Philadelphia? This probably sounds funny to most of you. And in case in these cases, in linguistics
we often prefix this with a question mark to indicate this is an unusual reading. The most readers will
not find grammatical. There may be some of you who do
find it grammatical, but for most people it seems odd. As a result, we'd say that serve actually
has two different meanings expressed in the first two sentences
that are different. Because they cannot be combined
in the third sentence. However zeugma isn't always a problem and
you can actually get some pretty interesting yoking of
multiple meanings together. So for example, Mark Twain, has the famous phrase they covered
themselves in dust and glory. They cover yourself in dust
as well to become dirty. But to cover yourself in glory, this is more of a poetic license
describing attaining glory. Star Trek The Next Generation
has the phrase, you're free to execute your laws and
your citizens as you see fit. Here execute adopts two different
meanings in terms of to carry out the laws versus to execute
as in kill citizens. Yet the sentence seems quite grammatical. You might even see these in some of funny
phrases like I like my X like I like my Y, Z. Typically, Z has adopted
a zeugmatic meaning that differentially modifies both
the X and the Y's in different ways. Yet, you can combine these two to
make a funny kind of expression. The kinds of semantic relationships we
have between senses actually hold between different senses of a word. So synonymy isn't between a word,
but really between its senses. And there are many such
semantic relationships. Two of the more common ones
are hypernymy or hyponymy. You could think of these as more general
or more specific kinds of things. There's metonymy, which is to use
one aspect to refer to another and we'll show an example of this one. And meronymy, which is X is a part of Y,
many such essential knowledge bases or NLP databases will have these types of
relationships between senses themselves. Let's look at synonymy briefly. We'll say that two senses are synonymous
if their meanings are nearly identical. Typically we won't require them to be
exactly identical because words may vary in slightly different ways
depending on context. The idea is that we can
swap the different words. And if the senses are synonymous, it really doesn't change the meaning
of that particular sentence. So how big is a plane or
am I flying on a large or small plane? You might say that there are two senses,
for big and for large that are synonymous in this case. Yet, there may be other ways
that these are not synonymous. So for example,
she became a big sister to them, or she became a large sister to them. Here we would say that there
are two senses of big and large that are not synonymous. And in fact, you can't say that
the words themselves are synonymous, only two senses are. This is a good reinforcing example
that it is senses that are synonymous, not necessarily words. Hyponymy is another common
sense relationship. And here we would say that sense
A is a hyponym of sense B, if A is a subclass of B or
A is a kind of B. For example, a dog is a kind of canine. Hyponymy is the complimentary
relationship, where B would be a kind of A. Just to give you a few examples,
we would say that a car is a kind of vehicle mango is the hyponymy
of fruit as a kind of fruit. A chair is a kind of furniture or
dog is the kind of mammal. Let's look at one last example metonymy. This is a sense relationship that you
may not even realize is happening, but it's actually quite common. Here we'll have two senses that describe
different aspects of an entity. And we'll use one to refer to another. This is perhaps best shown
through some examples. So for example,
the White House announced that. We see that White House has many
different potential meanings. Some would say the presidential
branch of the US government. Here we are actually
using a spokesperson for that branch as the intentional meaning. Or the upper peninsula
grows amazing apples. We could think that the apple tree,
is what could be described here or it could be the fruit of an apple tree? Depending on which thing
you're trying to describe. Third, we might say, I love Jane Austin. In practice, most people are not
referring to Jane Austin the person, but to the works of Jane Austin,
to an aspect of Jane Austin's identity. These substitutions are quite common and
we do them all the time thinking about how we want to highlight
particular aspects of an entity.
