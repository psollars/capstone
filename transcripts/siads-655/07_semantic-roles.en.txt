We talked a bit about word meaning. Let's try to generalize meaning
to a slightly higher level, and we'll talk about semantic roles. To illustrate this,
let's look at a few examples. Let's say that we have the sentence
the student wrote the program in Python using PyCharm. Or the Python program was written
by the student in PyCharm, or PyCharm was used to write
the Python program by the student. Here we'd say that these all mean the same
thing, and in fact that they have quite a bit of overlap, they primarily
differ in their syntactic analysis. What we'd like to say is it this is really
the same event that's being described in different ways. Event-based semantic roles
are one way to describe this. Here, we can think about verbs like buy,
or write, or tell. These verbs form predicates to
describe particular events. And that we can from these predicates
identify arguments that specify what the role is within this event. So for example, if the predicate is wrote,
we could say the student is a argument that maybe describes the author
of that particular predicate. Or that there's predicates for what is
written, or what it's written in, or what tool is used. These arguments essentially describe
the cause, or the result, or even the manner in which
something was done. In event-based semantic roles we'd like
to try to look at commonalities across predicates and to make some sort
of specification of what types of arguments each of these predicates take,
our predicates again describe events. There are many different
definitions of roles. And just to give you an example again
looking at the predicate for wrote, we could say that well,
there's a verb specific role for wrote here, the role is author. This is the role that student fills here. You could look at a more abstract role,
say the volitional cause of the event, the thing doing the event. We could even go to a very abstract
role say this is a do-er in an event as opposed to the receiver of the doing. These different definitions of roles at
different levels of specificity that allow us to generalize or
compare different types of predicates and are many different trade-offs. The key idea is that thematic roles
capture the common roles across different verbs the common arguments. So for example, if we say that the student
wrote the program in Python using PyCharm, or the musician played
a sonata on the guitar, or the lawyer delivered
a closing argument. We might be able to say that
in all three sentences, there's a commonality in terms of
someone creating something else. We can say that student musician and
lawyer have agency and are acting of their own volition and directly causing
something in the event to transpire. We'd like to be able to compare these
sentences by saying that they're evoking a similar type of semantic role and
playing out in a similar type of frame. We can also contrast this
with the event itself. By looking at programs to not an argument,
where we say that these are all the result of the events described in the predicate
for write, play or deliver. In thematic roles,
there are many different definitions, and this is an example of a subset of them. We can say that there's agent as
the volitional cause of an event, one of the roles that
we mentioned earlier. Someone experiencing an event but
not necessarily cause, a force behind the event say a wind or
an earthquake. We talk about the result or
the content, the beneficiary. There are many such semantic roles. To go back to our earlier example, say the student wrote the program
in Python using PyCharm. We can try to do role labeling, here,
looking at student as the agent. We can think about program as the result. We can even thing about
PyCharm as the instrument. Python itself is not labeled in these and I hope to show you that there are many
different types of roles that aren't necessarily covered with
the thematic roles. Roles themselves have
many uses in NLP though. And essentially often semantic role
labeling serves as an intermediate representation, much like how parsing has
served as an intermediate representation for other types of NLP tasks. Semantic roles however, are useful for
things like question answering, or machine translation or
even information extraction. For example, in machine translation, if we
know the role, we can potentially reorder the sentence in the translation to
make it easier for understanding. That said, there are many challenges in
defining what exactly is a role to do semantic role labeling with. What are the boundaries or criteria? For example, can a vacuum have volition? But it depends on whether the vacuum is a
Roomba, or what sort of other technologies built into the vacuum for us to say that
it's necessarily a cause versus an agent. Some folks have tried to argue that we
could simplify this down to very coarse roles and the fact that Dowty,
in the famous 1991 paper, has argued that there are really only
two roles that we could probably use. These are known as proto-roles for
proto-agent and proto-patient describing, the do-er and the thing that is done. Some definitions actually
have many more roles. One in particular known as FrameNet,
which we'll talk a little bit about later. Defining these roles depends quite a bit
on what your definition and scope are. In the next segment, we'll look at
different definitions of semantic roles and talk about how we might
discover them in text and use them.
