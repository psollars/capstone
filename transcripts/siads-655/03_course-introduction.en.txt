Alright, welcome natural
language processing. So, we have a very exciting class today. And I'm glad that you've joined us. Some of you might not actually realize
what Natural Language Processing is. So I thought it might be
useful to actually try to say, what's this class is going to
be the about at a high level? For one thing, I want you to think of
natural Language Processing is trying to build computer programs that
understand human language. This will be a challenging task. Another
thing to think about is going to try to create representations of language
that we can use for applications. Things like downstream tasks,
like understanding what people want, their intense or even solving
a problem that they might want to ask. You might still be thinking, why do
we need Natural Language Processing? Well, one of the big benefits of having
Natural language Processing in data science is it helps bring structure to
a lot of unstructured text data that we have. As a part of this, you'll learn about
techniques to reason about language. From this unstructured mess, you'll be
able to get information back out to reason about it and to understand human intense. And there's a huge
downstream applicability for many of the tasks that you
want to do in data science. The other thing is text is everywhere. And I want to emphasize that
text really is everywhere. We have all sorts of things that
we may not even think about. Our potential sources of data for
using data science techniques and Natural Language Processing. We have all of literature. Books are text.
We have things like newspapers. These daily updates that we receive. All sorts of news could be
really useful for doing NLP. We have things like legal documents and
notes. These two are text that can be analyzed
in mind. We have things like social media in its endless capabilities.
We even have things like office, an organizational documents that could
be mind to do interesting things. See, I want you to think of Natural
Language Processing as a gateway for data science. Natural Language Processing
takes this unstructured text. And let's you do things like information
extraction to pull out information and useful bits that you can use to
analyze that unstructured mess. You can do things like
time series analysis. Say to see whether certain words or
certain phrases or certain types of information
is increasing overtime. You can do things like digital humanities, like study our culture by looking
at the evolution or change or facets of particular types of
cultural products like books. You can do things like graph learning. And we'll talk in this class a little
bit about how to turn language structure into graphs. And finally, you can even do
things like causal inference. For example,
which headline might get more clicks? These are the kinds of things that natural
language processing can help you do. So, what's the applied part of the class? Natural Language Processing
is a really big field. I'd like to think of it like at Iceberg.
I'm going to show you the tip of the iceberg in this class. In this case,
will talk about common libraries that will help you understand natural language and
how to make sense of it. And used to effective
Natural Language Processing techniques. As a problem that will talk about the very
common techniques that use a practitioner will want to use to get something up and
running very quickly and to solve your task. We'll think about text as data science. And thinking about how to
turn the unstructured mess into something structured
that you can reason about. And use the rest of the materials
that you've learned in this course. And broadly in this program
to apply to text directly. But that said there's a lot of
stuff that's below the sea level. So one of the things that
we're not going to cover, that you hear a lot about with Natural
Language processing is deep learning. Many of the advanced techniques today do
use deep learning or advanced machine learning or neural networks to do
some of the most fancy techniques. This is beyond the scope of the current,
class. But you know that it does happen a lot? Also not talk exactly but
how algorithms work. You may have seen some of this
in your machine learning class. But for the most part, we'll try
to treat things as black boxes so that we can actually talk about
the language and about the representation. And there are many, many other cool
techniques that we just won't get a chance to talk about in this class,
unfortunately. So, what all is involved in
Natural Language Processing? I'd like to think about NLP as
perhaps a pyramid of language. Starting say from words,
from words we'll go to morphology. Thinking about how words
differ from each other? How the word form itself may changes
representation of the meaning? We think about syntax,
about the structure of language. We think about semantics about how things
actually, how sentence is in words. What do they actually
mean when put together? Of course,
there are more than just sentences. We have discourse. Thinking about what is a longer
piece of text, say a paragraph or a dialogue between two people mean? Thinking about pragmatics. What is intended by
the statement that is said? And even there's a social layer. There's all sorts of common sense
knowledge that we put together. So, Natural Language Processing is a huge
spending all of these things together. Just to give you a hint of some of the
techniques and approaches in applications that we might see each level,
let's look at a few of them together. At the word level, it may seem obvious. What are words? Well, they are the things that are there.
You're in class right now. That's 6 words. And that's pretty obvious to us. But to a computer,
we might ask what should a word be? For example, applied data
science is an amazing skill set. Data science itself is a concept. Should we treat data
Science is a unique word? Practitioner or an NLP user, you'll have to think about what should
constitute a word or concept for me. If you're dealing with social media,
you might see this NLP is fire, which is slang,
should emojis count as words? This is a real case when you have
to think about what constitutes a meaningful unit of entry
into my application. You might even run into cases where
you're working in different languages. So here we have Chinese, there are no
spaces to separate word boundaries. As a practitioner, you would need to say
how do I analyze this piece of text, if there aren't necessarily
obvious words for me to use? So this is some of the things
that you have to think about, at the morphology side, we can think
a little bit about say, parts of speech. So here if we have a sequence of words,
we could actually try to label things and say adverbs or adjectives, nouns,
verbs, proper nouns and so on. And we'd like to be able to pull these
things out to say, do some analysis. Similarly, we could try to look for
it named entities, so finding people, places and things. If you read this this sentence right here,
students enrolled in the University of Michigan School of Information's Master
of Applied Data Science Program, will take courses in all the essential
subjects in applied data science. Well there's a few things that stand
out as people, places, and things. For one, we had the University of
Michigan as an organization, two, we have the School of
Information as an organization. And then we have your degree,
the Master of Applied Data Science, and these are actual entities that
we would like to pull out and maybe reason about when
doing data science. At the syntax level,
we can try to connect words together, maybe to do information
extraction as well. So the scientists found
at her lab Ann Arbor, we could say what's the subject of the
sentence and what is the subject doing? We could pull it out
a subject relationship, or a direct object of relationship. What is being done? Even some sort of modifier to
describe where that's done, and we'll talk about how to both apply and
extract this type of information. At the semantics level, we could try to reason about
what's the meaning of a sentence. So, one example that will talk
about in this lecture today is, sentiment analysis, trying to understand
whether something is positive or negative. This sentence I love cats
seems very positive, but we can also think about more complex
cases, about what is being intended here? So here's a review,
when I turn state witness, they didn't have enough money to put
me into witness protection program, so they bought me this mask, and gave it
a list of suggested places to move. Is this a positive review? If you know the mask, it probably seems like a positive
review because there's a lot of humor. So there's a lot that goes into
thinking about the semantics and what's the intended meaning. At the discourse level, as we move higher
up to thinking about larger units of text, one of the things that NLP is done
recently is focused a lot on question answering. So if you say have
a Wikipedia bio page here for Dorothy Johnson Vaughan,
we could read this page and ask a machine learning natural language processing
system, where did Dorothy Vaughan work? We could even say let's
try to do summarization so to do something like
an automated cliffs notes. Here we can take a larger paragraph,
and we could try to smash it down into something smaller by
retaining what's important. This also let's us do
things like translation, which is incredibly challenging here. This also let's us do translation
on many different languages, so there's lots of opportunity. Finally, just to show a few
more at the top level, thinking about pragmatics, we have
things like language generation, so there's autosuggests that you get on your
phone or say on common search engines. These types of suggestions let us think
about how do we create longer units of meaning, especially if we're
thinking about dialog. One of the hottest applications in
natural language processing these days, is thinking about chat bots or
conversational agents. These are often, say useful in customer
service when you want to try to triage an early dialogue with the customer to
figure out where to best route them. Of course, this seems like a lot to talk
about, so what are we going to talk about? For one we'll talk about
text classification, this often a very common application to
do it with natural language processing, especially at the data science level. Well, think about sequence labeling, that
was like the part of speech tagging or the named entity recognition
tasks that I showed you earlier. We'll think about word meaning,
it's going to be useful for trying to track word connotations. We'll talk a little bit about syntax
in the structure of language. This is often can be very useful for
information extraction, and in fact we will talk about information
extraction and how those to relate. And finally we'll think about discourse, so trying to pull out larger
meaning from larger units of text. I want to also emphasize that NLP
itself is very interdisciplinary. So within the space of NLP, we still
have connections to say, robotics. So thinking about how humans, or even conversational agents
can interact with us. We have lots of work from machine
learning, thinking about the core that black box, part of NLP that
we won't talk too much about. But there's often co-commitment
advancements made in both. Well, think about artificial intelligence,
how do we reason about the world and make assumptions? And there's some work in cognitive science
thinks about how humans, how do we actually understand language and how can
that inform how we could process this? Finally, there's some work in linguistic, Thinking about the structure of language
and the formal study of language. Of course, there's many applications
beyond in social science. Language is a very social phenomena. I just want to emphasize that
language is not just English. And when we say NLP,
NLP itself is not just English. So many of the techniques
that will talk about today. I will show you examples in English, because that's the language
that we are all fluent in. However, if you're working in other
languages, NLP should work in them. And there are many new and exciting techniques that can be
tuned to different languages. So this class will teach you a required
skillset to do common NLP tasks will be incredibly helpful for
you in your applied data science degree. Well familiarized with the concepts that
able to go beyond what you've learned in the class and do more advanced NLP. And will help you turn this
text into structured data for use in applied data science, thanks.
