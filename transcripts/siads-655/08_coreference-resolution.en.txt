Let's look at
higher-order structure and set in text directly. Today we'll talk about
co-reference resolution. Let's illustrate
co-reference resolution from an example text. In practice many texts contain types of referring expressions. Here, we have a discussion
of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was an Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993 until her death in
September 2020. I'd like to reason something
about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. To do so, we have to understand which expressions refer back
to Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As you read through,
you actually will spot seven total references
in this passage, and there are many more
in the document below. These are what's known as
referring expressions. As a human reader, we often gloss over
these and implicitly understand that
these are connected back to a particular entity. There also may be
overlapping expressions too, for example, the Supreme Court of
the United States has additional references where it's only referred to as Court. We as readers implicitly
know that this refers back to the Supreme Court of the United States in this context. For this, we will refer to the original entity
as its reference. For example, in the her
we'll refer to this as a referring expression that refers to another
reference in the text. Coreference resolution
is the idea of taking these
reference and referring expressions and
trying to link them altogether to what's known
as a coreference chain. Here, linking Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, she, her, Ginsburg and any other text strings that refer back to
this particular entity. Coreference resolution is one of the critical steps for trying
to understand discourse. For example, if we wanted
to ask questions for passages like: "Who nominated
Ruth Bader Ginsburg?" If we went directly to the text, we would see she was nominated by President Bill Clinton
replacing Justice Byron White. However, to understand this, we'd have to understand who her or she is
referring to in text. Similar, if we wanted to ask, "When did Ginsburg die?" We see that phrase, her death in September 2020. Again, we have to resolve
the referring expression, her back to the right entity in order to make that connection. However, coreference is a challenging step for
understanding discourse. Levesque proposed this famous
Winograd Schema Challenge from Terry Winograd's
original ideas. Here, look at the expression. The trophy would not fit into the brown suitcase because
it was too small or big. In this case, the word, it, can refer to either the trophy or the suitcase depending
on the adjective. For example, the trophy would not fit into the suitcase
because it was too small. Firstly, the suitcase
being small, whereas the trophy
would not fit into the brown suitcase
because it was too big, refers to the size of the trophy. Understanding and resolving
this ambiguity in what it refers to requires quite advanced language
understanding. Another famous example. The town councilors
refuse to give the demonstrators a permit
because they feared violence. Here, they, first
of the counselors, whereas we changed the expression to, they advocated violence. They refers to the demonstrators. Solving these requires
many kinds of real-world social
and other kinds of pragmatic understanding
about the meanings of words. Creating a challenging
step for doing coreference resolution and
resolving these pronouns. Coreference can be a
difficult task in general, as you can think about what
reference might refer to. For example, I took the test
and it went pretty well. Here, it, refers to the entire expression
that taking of the test, not just an entity. Or the captain looked upon the ship and
remembered her fondly. In English, ships are often referred to with
a feminine gender. Thinking about her may not
actually refer to a person, it may refer to a ship. Or even as one famous
example from Recasens et al. In France, the president is elected for a term
of seven years, while the United States, he's elected for a term of four years. Well, it's a slightly
gendered example admittedly. Here, the point is that he refers not to the
president of France, but to a parallel reference. In this case, it's a false
coreference resolution to refer to the he and President. In practice, however, pronominal
coreference is easier, but there's still a long tail of challenging coreference
chains that make it difficult in
practice to say that you have all of the reference
referred to correctly. There are many different
applications for coreference, especially for mining information
from large documents. Doing document analysis, information extraction
and narrative extraction. In many cases, looking
at things like legal text or
executive summaries, we'd like to use
coreference resolution to resolve the ambiguities
of these references, the he's the it's and the she's, and understand how these refer back to entities in
order to extract meaningful information
about who's doing what and what is happening
in a particular document.
