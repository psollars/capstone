So we talked about how
this already was an example of exploding data, and we talked about how
depending on your monitor, there's a very faint white
box around the 2014 data. It looks great on my monitor, I don't know how
it looks on yours. And here you see some
best practices, right? You see that there's clear
distinction between colors, you see that they've
got the source data, you can see who created it, which is good because
I did take it out of context from the
greater news article. But this is another
one that Lauren and I sort of worked on together, and here one of the things
that I wanted to figure out was they're making the case here that road quality in
Michigan is declining. If you're not from this
part of the world, we do get a lot of snow
on and off in Michigan, so that means there's always
a lot of salt on the roads, which degrades the quality
of roads over time. Here they were really
trying to show you in part how the years leading up
to the 2008 recession and the years after have left our roads in
worse condition. So the way this is
visualized right now is interesting, right?
because we can see that gray bar for
Fair is going down, and we can see that the
red Poor is going up, and the fact that
the poor roads are red kind of taps into that emotion. Red is also the color of blood
so it can look kind of violent and problematic. And yet, there are perhaps other messages that we might want
to pull out of this. So Lauren using her Inkscape
technique started by saying she thought maybe she would
do a stacked bar chart, here is a horizontal
stack bar chart, and she thought she
would play with the colors. And she thought, "I'm going to make the
colors even more literal. I'm going to have like
green means go, so that's the good one. Fair is a neutral color, and Poor is, I'm really
going to work up the red." So she did this and she actually hadn't been thinking
about a traffic light, but we were suddenly
like, "Wait, green and red are also
parts of a traffic light, maybe instead of Fair being gray, we should make it yellow." And so she changed the
color of that layer, and she changed it into a
vertical stacked bar chart, and then she and I looked
at it and thought, "Well, that looks just like
the flag of Jamaica, so now that's giving off a message that we
didn't expect." So even though we have this
sort of the traffic light look, and that was part of why
she turned this into vertical stacked bar charts
to kind of plant that metaphor, this wasn't quite where
she wanted to go. So then we tried again. We tried here using
gradations of color, so that the poor roads
were the most red, and the fair roads
whee the medium red, and the good roads
were the lightest red, and this made the most
sense because we weren't seeing like Italian flags and
Jamaican flags any more. But still we weren't
sure that it was getting the exact
message that we wanted. So we actually took the
data from this bar chart, and we stuck it in Google Sheets and played around
with it a little bit. And so we tried with a pie chart. This is, a pie chart, remember, is really good for comparing
parts of a whole. So we tried just visualizing the earliest data
and the latest data. And here you can see there's a lot more poor roads and
there's fewer fair roads. Those are sort of the two big
takeaways we get. So we stuck this into Google Sheets, and we thought a pie chart was a really good way
to visualize this because it helps us see
percentage of a whole. It's a very familiar structure, and we're keeping the
data very simple. We don't have a million segments. So we thought this would be a good place for us to go next. And this was better, because we
can definitely see that the poor roads are a bigger
chunk of the 2014 data, which was the latest data in
that original bar chart. 2004 was the the earliest data
in the bar chart, so we're going to see that's the
strongest contrast, and we could definitely
see that the percentage of fair roads was declining. So we thought we were
a little closer to being on the right track. And you'll notice here that as we pulled this out of Google Sheets, we also took away the default key that
exists in Google Sheets, and we superimposed the
words on the graph itself. And that helped keep things
a little bit more streamlined and a little clearer. And here we also made a choice
that really we didn't think the actual percentages
mattered in this visualization
because we were trying to communicate, frankly, a blunter message, which is
the roads are getting worse. And we can see the difference
in the proportions, and so it becomes less important, given that there are
only three slices, that will tell you exactly
what percentage is what. And that's what gave us the
thought that we maybe needed to simplify even further. Maybe all we had to do was say, "How many roads are poor and how many are fair or better?" And so we went back
into Google Sheets, we added up the data
for good and fair, and here we have a very
simplified set of pie charts. And now we're very dramatically showing that the percentage of poor roads in this ten-year period is significantly different. You don't really know how
this is going to play out until you start
experimenting a little bit. Again, we left off the
percentages because here we don't necessarily need them to show
the magnitude of the issue. Maybe if this is in a report, those specific data points
might be in the narrative or might be in a chart, but they're not so
important here. That was really fun
for the two of us to tag team and work on together. Remember that we looked at this tax cuts expiring
as this being an example of a wonky y axis that didn't start
at the zero line, and we simplified it
into this one that did. And you can see again, we superimposed the number, we did that in PowerPoint, to make things as
clean as possible, instead of sticking the
number above the bar chart, which is how the default
in PowerPoint worked. And we were looking really here at the fact that if the
tax cuts expired, the wealthiest Americans
were going to have that five-and-half
percent increase. And you know, remember in
Week 1 we talked about Coco Chanel and how she
would say things like, "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and
take one thing off"? Sometimes just when you think
you're done with something, it is worth asking yourself, is there any other way
that you could do this? And as I was working through this, I heard one of those
Elizabeth Warren pep rallies and she was talking about
the 2 percent wealth tax, and I thought, "Oh, so we're
really asking, in this case, the difference between the
old rate and the new rate would be a nickel on the dollar,
five-and-a-half cents." And so sometimes you can find that an unusual choice will make
things stand out even more. And so my final, like just when
I'm about to go out the door, I stop and ask how I'm
going to change it, that moment for me was to say, "Maybe it's about
emphasizing the nickel." And here I've still got
the specific amount, it's actually
five-and-a-half cents, and it says that in the subtitle. But I've now got
this catchier title, and I'm trivializing
the difference between 34 and 39-and-a-half percent, right, by saying it's just a nickel. Now there's definitely
bias built into this. Clearly, I'm not one of
the wealthiest Americans, so I can joke about other
people's tax money, but this is just a way to think differently about how
you represent things. I will also say that this is
actually a 2013 nickel, this would have been
the nickel that was out then, and yet it's still isn't our default
mentel model of nickel, so an earlier version of
the coin might even have been better for triggering
those emotional responses. So in honor of Coco Chanel, just when you think you're done, it's always worth asking, "Is there another
way to do this?" Next up, we're going
to take a look at an online tool that you might prefer to the Inkscape or PowerPoint or Google
Sheets approaches, and we'll do that next.
