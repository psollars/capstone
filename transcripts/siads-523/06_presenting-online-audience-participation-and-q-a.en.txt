Welcome back. As we continue thinking about presenting on line, I want to talk about a
component that will be present when you are presenting
in the workplace, but that we're not requiring
for the assignment. And that's handling of how the
audience interacts with you, and question and answer periods. So oftentimes when we do
online presentations, the norm is that you have a
question and answer period. So people expect
to have that time. But different disciplines
have different rules or norms about how question
and answer is handled. So in some academic disciplines, people ask questions
as questions arise, and the expectation is
that the speaker will stop and clarify and then go on. However, other disciplines have question and answer at the end. So you'll want to sort of
alert your folks as they come in to your session about how participation
is going to go. So in your introduction you
might say something like, I'll stop a few times during this presentation so
you can ask questions, or I'm going to ask you to
hold questions to the end. If you're presenting
to a big group, sometimes your webinar will
actually have a moderator, and the moderator will
keep track of questions as they show up in
the chat window as the webinar continues and then they feed those questions to the
presenter at the end. But you want people to know that first,
asking questions is okay, and when the right
time might be to do that. You also want them to
think about what kinds of tools they use for interactivity. In a small video
conference meeting, everybody's going to have
their microphone and you'll be able to just
talk to one another. As your group gets
bigger, however, you might want to set
some expectations for how engagement happens. So if you're doing a
presentation for 500 people, you're not going to work
500 microphones turned on. That's just going to add
to a sense of chaos. But what you might
do is you might say, we'll take questions
in the chat window, some platforms have a Q&A window, and you want to just alert
them of what the norm is. And you also probably
at the same time want to alert them to whether or not they can also chat among
themselves as time goes on. It's another way in which the
chat feature can be used. So if you're trying
to create a sense of community and a sense of
warmness in your room, you might even invite that. Sometimes when I am
giving presentations to K-12 educators, for example, much of the content might be geared towards highschoolers, but there may always end up being one or two kindergarten
teachers who show up. In that case, it's
actually helpful to me to have the ability
for me to present while the participants are talking with one
another and guiding themselves to adapting
something to their grade level. I don't know how you feel
during question and answer, but sometimes I feel
like I'm really on the spot and I'd better have
an answer right away. And if question and answers
make you nervous, here's some things
that I do to help. First of all, no
one expects you to start answering the second
their question ends. So you always have time
to take a deep breath, and we'll talk more about
that in the next section. That's one of the
best things we can do to calm ourselves down. I also like to say thank
you for the question. That does two things. One, it honors that they've
asked, and secondly, if your brain needs a
little more time to think, then a statement like that gives you a little bit more space. Next, and this is
particularly important when you're on the
face-to-face end of things, as well as the online end, you want to repeat the question to make sure everybody got it. So if you're reading a
question out of the chat, you would want to read
that question aloud. If you are in a
face-to-face setting, you would want to repeat it
as well. And that's become a real rallying cry in
conferences as we're filming this in 2019,
because people with hearing impairments or people who missed the question
or were distracted want a chance to hear
what's going on. And then you're going to respond. If you don't know the answer, it's okay to say you
don't know the answer. Sometimes you may have to say, "I'm not sure about that, can I get back to you?" And then make sure that you do. So oftentimes when I'm
presenting in a webinar, I have a notebook next to me where I can write
those notes down of things that I've committed to doing because then it's
important that you actually follow up. And give the best answer
that you can give. Remember that honesty is better than looking like
you have all the answers. So don't be afraid to say, "Let me get back to
you about that." And then finally, it can
be really helpful to double-check that you actually answered the question
that they asked. And so thinking about a followup
like, does that help? Did I answer your question? Did I make sense? Are all ways in which you give them the opportunity to ask
for clarification. So think about a couple of
those types of sentences for your toolkit so that it looks
natural when you do that. I am surprised at how often
when I ask this question, there is a followup or
a clarifying question, or, quite frankly,
that I got it wrong. So I've found that this is a
really valuable addition to my toolkit because if my goal is for my audience to
be more empowered, then I need to be the one who's making sure that they are
understanding things. Now, I want to talk
too about wait time. And wait time is an education term that has to do with
how long do you wait before you ask a question
before someone answers. And when I talk to
people who are doing their first online presentations in video conferences
and webinars, oftentimes they tell me that
the most freaky moment of the whole presentation
comes when they say, "Are there any questions?" and nobody says or does anything. And that's because there
is a delay between when someone hears what you
said in your transmission, the time it takes them to understand what
they just heard, and to formulate a question
and potentially to type it can be quite long. And this is true. This wait
time trick is true in face to face and on line. It's just particularly acute in
the online environment. So when I'm giving a webinar
and I ask a question, I have to remember
to wait ten seconds. Usually if I don't have a
question after ten seconds, that probably means there aren't going to be any questions. And that can seem like an
endless amount of time. But it is amazing how
a little more waiting and a little less jumping
on to the next thing does to keep that warm
and cozy environment that you've been
trying to create. So I always remember
ten-second wait time. My residential students
when we talk about this often say they can see it once they know that's my trick, they can actually see
me sort of tapping my fingers to keep myself
honest to count to ten. So ten seconds is about
right for on line. Sometimes eight seconds is
more right for face to face, but I allow ten anyway. It also gives a really
nice signal that you actually do want
to hear questions, that you aren't just
saying that and hoping you can get that part over with. So a ten-second wait time
is one of my favorite instructional
strategies. Now, I want to talk a
little bit about nerves. So there's some
interesting things that can happen when we present face to face
versus present virtually. And some people are more nervous in one environment or another. Often we hear that introverts
are actually much more comfortable with online
presentations than face to face, because it feels cozier and there's less sort of stage
fright involved. So here's some things
that have helped me with dealing with nerves. First of all, this is
my rehearsal studio. I seem to spend a ton
of time in the car. It's no surprise that the University of
Michigan is just down the highway from the Motor City. And I find that when I have a
big presentation coming up, I am constantly talking
to myself in the car. I'm working through ideas, I'm thinking about how I want to say things, and over time, the repetition of those
ideas starts to impact themselves on my memory and suddenly I don't have to
speak with a script so much, or I can just write
down a few key points, or I can just put an
image on a slide and I'll remember what it
is that I need to say. Now, I say this because for you, your rehearsal studio might be your shower or your
bathroom mirror, but there really is no way to work on your nerves
except to practice. To make sure that you're as comfortable as you
can be explaining ideas and having that sense
of mastery over the moment. This keyboard image is here because for some of my
residential students, they find that one
of the best ways for them to prepare is they actually script out
everything that they are going to say
in their presentation. So for me, sometimes
scripting things out helps me sort of figure out
what role I'm going to play. Kind of like an actress. Am I among a group of
elementary school teachers? Am I with a group
of school leaders? Am I with a group of
library directors? Am I with a group of folks who
are going to be librarians? Each of them requires a different set of vocabulary
and a different touch. And you know this from your
own presentations to this date in your
classes and such. So again, I almost never
end up using the script, but it helps me settle in
to who I'm talking to. And here is a lovely photo of
someone's grandmother. Another strategy
that we have found in our residential
coursework is that students find that pretending they are talking to a loved one, and grandma is the loved one they identify the most often, helps make sure that they
are staying as friendly, as nonjudgmental, and as
non-condescending as possible. So they find that this
really puts them in the mode of being helpful and of trying to maximize
comprehension on the other end. So if that works for you, you can put a photo of your loved one just off
the side of your webcam, or you can use your imagination. And what is remarkable is, when folks tell me
that they do this, you can hear it in their voice. You can hear that there's a different tenor that's
just a little bit warmer, a little bit more confident. It's a rather magical technique. Now, maybe that's not your
style or your cup of tea, in which case, dress up. Some people actually for
online presentations, or for online
interviews or anything else where they feel like they're going
to be on the spot, they like the confidence that presenting themselves
professionally brings. So if you're someone that
rises to the occasion when you put on a suit or whatever business attire is
for you, try it. I know lots of graduate
students who put on a suit to do a phone
interview because it just makes them feel like
they're more authoritative and more sort of in control of
the conversation. Sunglasses are optional. And finally, let's talk
about breathing. So the number one
thing that calms me down is when I stop and
take a really deep breath. And when I say deep breath, I don't mean like the
breath stops about here, I mean the entire
belly is moving and filling up with
air and going out. So what I want you
to think about here is you breathe in through
your nose and out through your mouth and keep pushing the breath out
until there's nothing left. That process of slowing
down that natural movement is going to do so much to
help you get resettled, right? We breathe less rapidly
when we're calmer. So this is the thing that
works the best for me. And I will say that it
actually works better for me standing up
than sitting down, because there's a little
bit more room for that diaphragm to expand. All right. That's it for this lesson.
