Hi. Welcome back.
In this section, we're going to talk
about those scenarios and how to work with an audience. So let's get started. You'll know from looking
at the scenarios that one of them is
for Chicken Kitchen. Between the two options
presented there, one was Kendall County in Texas and one is Frederick
County in Maryland. Your job is to narrow down
to which county looks more amenable to be the site
of the next franchise. In order to do that, you
have to think about "How would I make that decision?" Well, we know that that company has some particular,
that it thrives in communities with
particular demographics. They tend to be communities
that are wealthier, that lean a little bit
more conservative, that have more recent building, and that have the disposable
income in order to eat out. We also know that
Chicken Kitchen, while technically in
the fast food category, is like places like Panera, one step up from budget fast food places like
McDonald's or Burger King. So it's not just do they eat out, but can they afford that extra couple of
dollars per entree. So in order to decide, I need to learn some more
about those communities. So I'm going to walk
you through some of the data sources that I would use and some of the
questions that I would ask to help
me figure that out. But before we do that, I want to talk a little
bit about context. Even from the earliest phase
of your research here, I want you to be mindful
about who the audience is for your ultimate communication and this question of "what's your why?" And this will come up a couple of times as we go through the term, which is a thought
coined by Simon Sinek. So let's talk first about
who you're trying to inform. In your practice as
a data scientist, sometimes you'll be talking to peers and that's when you're using all kinds of
data science slang. That's when you're talking
about Python or R, you're talking about JavaScript, you're talking about
complex statistical tools. And as you work up to managers, you may stop talking
so much about the minute details and start talking a little bit
more big picture. But ultimately, the
decision-making power in each of your scenarios lies with
the executive of a company. And that's important because there
are several factors that come into play when we're
talking to executives. First, you're
talking to the folks who actually have the power to make decisions. And because
they have that power, they're also extremely busy. So the power is in you to be succinct in the ways
in which you communicate. And that's why we'll
explore things like a short executive summary and a long-length report. And that's why your oral
presentation that you record is going to be
so relatively short. But executives are
often not expert in data science or perhaps not
even expert in statistics. And that means we can either
load them up with a bunch of technical information that
they may not understand, which could lead to some
unintended outcomes, or we can be that bridge
builder who figures out how to communicate that information to the executives in a
way that's respectful, appealing, engaging,
and that ultimately guides them to adopt the decision
that you feel is best. And there's always some ambiguity in the choices that you make. So even in this example scenario that we'll be
working through all semester, at any point, the recommendation
could go the other way. And the idea there is to
recognize that it's rarely the case that there's
only one good answer. So again, we're not going
to concentrate on here, "Did you decide
the way we decided?" But instead, we want you to
think about the arguments you make and the case you make for why your decision
is the best one. As we're thinking about
that executive audience, we're thinking about
"what's my why?" We're thinking about
what they need to know in order to
make that decision. That means we're going
to be judicious about what data we look at that
we ultimately include. And you're going to find
as we go through this process that you're going to find a ton of information. And at first, everything is going to simultaneously look
important and/or relevant. And over time, as you become more knowledgeable and
more confident about the ways in which that data is starting to roll
together for you, you will start to realize that some of that data
is more persuasive than others and some of your arguments are more
persuasive than others. So in a way, you're going
to let your garden grow, and then as you get
ready to present, you're going to weed out the information that's
less important. The other thing you might
be thinking about is, do you already have credibility? So we've all had that class with the world-famous professor
whose slide decks look terrible and who
bumble as presenters. But we put up with
it because we know that they're amazing and
they won the Nobel Prize. So we'd better listen, right? In most cases, if you
are in this position, you don't yet have that
level of assumed authority. And that's why we'll need
to think about how we can use graphical
elements and text and formatting and vocal
delivery to help build you up, to sort of be your backup
singers as a professional. So let's think a
little bit more about those executives and
what they care about. Duarte points out that
for-profit executives tend to have their minds
on these three things. First, they have
their mind on money. How can we maximize
our revenue and maximize our profit
with the lowest costs? So arguments about money might be particularly
persuasive for them. Secondly, they're
interested in market, having a bigger share
of the market and, or perhaps thinking
about the time between research and development
and getting to market. So there's often a sense of
time urgency for executives. They don't want to spend
too much time developing a product that might
take six years to come to market if they could find a product that they
could develop in three years and with
similar revenue outlooks. And finally, they tend to
care about exposure, which means they tend to
maximize retention and sometimes maximize the status
quo, and minimize risk. Now, this last one, if you're working
with a for-profit executive in a startup, you might find that
their motivation is a little bit different. So the Mark Zuckerberg Facebook "move fast and break things" is an exception to this rule. But my entire career, I have always worked
for non-profits and non-profits are driven
a little bit differently. So when we think
about non-profits, they might also care
about other things. So imagine that you're pitching to the head
of the hospital, or the head of the United Way, or the head of an
arts organization, or the head of an
independent school. They tend to also care about things
like trust and reputation. So they both want to maximize the support they have
for the community, but minimize potential
embarrassments, wobbles, mistakes, or fissures in how
people think about them. Secondly, they often tend
to think about impact, which is that they
really want to achieve the mission of the
organization and they want the most dollars and the most effort to
go into achieving that mission and not into
unproductive activities, wasteful spending, poor
use of staff time. They also value relationships. Not-for-profits are often
concerned with human beings as either their clients
or their customers or the benefactors of something. So they want to maximize
those human relationships, whether they are with
someone who will receive a service or they're the one who's funding
that service, and they often want to
minimalize what for lack of a better term, I'll
call individualism. Minimize the sense that everyone stands
alone in isolation. And finally, non-profit executives, especially those who work
in the arts or research, often want to maximize those
very messy opportunities. Creativity is messy,
it's expensive, and it's very human-driven. Research takes time to develop, to test, to validate. So they want to make sure
that there's a lot of time that can go into
those process things, whereas maybe a for-profit person is really focused on product, and minimize distractions or
things that get in the way. So a good head of a research group will want to
maximize the amount of time they're spending on research
and minimize the amount of time they're spending on bureaucratic paperwork,
for example. So you can see how depending on what kind of executive
you're pitching to, you might use different
ways of communicating. Now, sometimes you'll get a for-profit executive
who also cares about relationships and
oftentimes you do get not-for-profit
executives who often care about money as well. But knowing the sense of
what matters to them will help give you a lens
for how to look at data. And I'll give you one more example. In my old life, I worked for an
elementary school principal, and my value when I worked with students was
I really wanted to see them using their brains
in problem solving and making decisions and practicing
higher-order thinking. But this present principal had started his career
as a school janitor. And that long career that
led to him being a teacher and
ultimately a principal meant that he was
really concerned with people feeling safe
and happy in a space. So if I went in and
talked about, "Oh, they're doing all this
difficult problem-solving," he would paste this polite but
sort of pained smile on his face. So I wasn't going
to be able to make my message carry out well. But if I told a story of
engagement, if I said, "I'm trying this
new experiment with my students and what
I'm finding is that they're really diving
in and they're really excited about
learning and they really can't wait
to come in the room and keep learning every
day," he would light up. Either way, I was
asking for support for the methods I was trying, and either way, my
ask was the same. But in one situation I could get a stronger response from
him than the other. So he was more likely to say yes when I framed it
in things he valued. So be mindful of that as you move through these scenarios. Next up, we're going to
start our data exploration.
