Welcome back. Now it's time to put
our work gloves on and start thinking about
design considerations. So I want to return us to this chart
we've been looking at throughout. We've understood our purpose and
our audience. We've been using potential displays to
figure out what's important in the data. And now we're ready to really
start doing the design work. So we're going to focus
on these small four boxes in the bottom right-hand corner. Removing unnecessary distractors,
minimizing cognitive load, focusing on what matters, and
using aesthetics to communicate. Now let's take a look at
each of those in turn. Removing unnecessary distractors is what
your textbook calls eliminating clutter. I think that I like this term
of unnecessary distractors more, this is work that comes from Duarte,
because things can be cluttery but still useful, but things that
are distractors don't help at all. Here's some things that you look for
in this phase. First of all, poor alignment. So one of the things, remember we
looked at that Pew Research table and it had that table that
the data was all centered in, and it just created these like
snake lines going down the table. That's an example of alignment. I like this expression that Nolan Haim
makes about distracting pixels, anything that's there that
doesn't really have to be there. It can also have to do with uncoordinated
or non-systemic use of color and contrast, that you don't have
a consistent color scheme throughout or that different hues of a same color are
not used consistently across your report. Sometimes the issue is too much text. There's just too much text in too
many places and too many lines. Maybe all the intervals are marked. Maybe you've got too many intervals
going up and down the y axis. Sometimes it's a key that hangs off
the side of a visualization when that key could be incorporated
into the visualization itself. And sometimes labels outside of
the visualization can be an issue. And we talked about that when we looked
at that pie chart with the flags, and how some of the percentages were inside
the pie chart, and how neat those looked, and how some were outside, and
how cluttery those looked. This is our really cool
research study, and this is a table that
accompanies the study. And you see a lot of these when
you do scholarly research. And because the primary audience for
scholarly research is other researchers, often you see tables like this. And there's actually some really important
data in this table, and I thought let's try to figure out how we can make
this important data stand out some more. The reason this is important is because
this is a study that looks at how folks from different races described whether or
not they've been discriminated against. And there's some pretty remarkable data,
and there's also several data messages, several learning objectives, that we
could choose to bring out in this table. So this is definitely
data worth visualizing. So I see sort of four big issues here. One is there's just a lot of data here. There's a lot of numbers and it's hard for me to tell what numbers are more
important and less important. Complicating that is
there's a lot of lines. So I see that these lines are segmenting
data but I'm not really sure. You'll also notice that there's
even an issue with column width. That this is actually showing
some kind of survey data but each column is a different width. And so it's hard for us to know are some columns wider
because they're more important? Next, we see lots of
center alignment here. So you can see that all this text
has been centered, which makes our eyes sort of jag
our way down each list, especially this center column that's
got so much white space in it. And sort of a minor thing, we see
this shifting between italics and regular text over in the
far right corner, which is scientifically correct to
do to show standard deviation, but adds perhaps a bit of visual clutter that
distracts from what we're trying to do. So here's what I did to start. In her book Storytelling with Data,
Knaflic often talks about how she goes to everything being
gray in her visualizations, and then she figures out what
does she need to draw out. And when I look at tabular data, my instinct is always to
left justify everything. And we'll talk later about how that's
not always the best thing to do. But for me what it helps me do is
it helps me see all the information without some of that visual clutter. So we will fix this later. And
I've changed the font to a sort of more open font that's a little
bit easier on the eyes for a screen, and that's a sans serif font. And you'll also notice that
I've made all of the columns of the survey response data
equidistant and equally sized. So I no longer have this sense that some
data is wider just because it had a longer survey response of text, right? Now let's take a look
at what happens next. Next, what I decided is I thought the lines
might be superfluous, that they might be adding a sense of visual confusion
more than a sense of visual cohesion. So I took those lines away and
instead I used some colored shading to differentiate one
kind of information from another. So you can see very clearly now that we have two lines of data that
are about African-American responses, two lines of data that are about
Asian responses, for example. Then I decided that I was going to really
start focusing people's attention. So one of the things I did was that
I shrunk down the font size of the n, n is the number of total survey
responses represented here. And I did this because it's very
hard to compare data equitably when you're comparing raw numbers
where the n is so very, very different. So there are almost 20 times as many
Whites being surveyed here as Asians. So instead of comparing the actual
raw number of responses, we'd do better to calculate a percentage, also known
as our rate, and then to compare those. So I started to do that by
shrinking that font size down. But I'm still not telling a story. And I will say here that you'll notice
I've stripped out some rows of data just to fit things a little bit better
on the screen for illustration, and you may choose to do that as well. You'll also notice that I've
added a header and a subheader, and I've used some shading to note
the boxes I want you to look at. Now I could have done this
in lots of other ways. We could have merged all
of the Yes columns, so that we really saw don't know,
No, and Yes. And that would have delivered a
much more blunted set of information. We might have lost some nuance. But the story we might have told there
was that clearly we have almost an inverse relationship between how Blacks
and whites are seeing discrimination. In this case I'm choosing to tell what is probably more of
a minor story in this data. And here we've done even
more simplification. We might decide if we are making this for
the New York Times, that really the n is not what matters,
it's the percent that matters. So here we've done a couple of things. We have labeled the dark blue chart header, pointing out that it's by percent. We've also rounded the figures
to the nearest percent, and we've done some alignment shifting. We've moved away from that left
justification that's my starter crutch. So here what you'll notice
is we took the percent signs away from the tabular data itself. And instead we noted at the top
that we had by percent, we noted that the bottom that figures
were rounded to the nearest percent. And that means we're removing that
visual clutter of percent, percent, percent signs going all across the table. Now if you're making a table that had,
say, percents in some categories and raw numbers and other columns,
then you might choose to add that visual repetition to be clearer
about the different types of data. Or you might choose to just label that
column as being a percent number. And again, that's going to be sort of
situational to the scenario that you're encountering. And finally, you'll notice that we
right-justified the numbers in the table. And we also right-justified
the headers to match up with that. And what we've done done by doing that,
this is a best practice for numerical and financial data, is now we see if we go
back to early arithmetic we see that all the ones column lines up and
all the tens column lines up. So that we can see that there
actually is a big difference between the size of the White and the Black and Asian responses in
the column that's marked in green. And that can help us
better evaluate things. Now we've also stripped
out the decimal points and the numbers after the decimal point. Again, we're talking with a general
audience who doesn't need to know information in that detail. So as you see we have moved
this data across several different phases as we have thought
through who needs to see this data, what is the story we need them to tell. And we have helped to focus a mainstream
reader's attention in that way. Now if you do a lot of work with tabular
data, especially with finance data, if you calculate a lot of reports, there are some effective practices
when you are presenting that data, especially if you're essentially
pulling it straight out of Excel and copying and pasting it into
another document. And if you are that person, I would highly
recommend the book Painting with Numbers by Randall Bolten. The subtitle is Presenting
Financials and Other Numbers so People Will Understand You. And it will walk through things like how
you can use preattentive attributes, he doesn't use that term but it's
everywhere in concept, and how you can organize that information more clearly so
that it's more readable more quickly. And like our course, he is
focused on executives and readers who have limited time. So I have put the record. The Ebook is available through
U of M Library if that is helpful for you. One thought before we go, however.
This is a screenshot of the Federal Election Commission's
2016 election results. And you'll notice here that we've got
lots of those little violations that we've been talking about
throughout, right? You see that all of the numerical
data is centered, you see that there's Times New Roman, you see that
there's lots of use of borders and lines. But there's also a sense in which
we almost expect, for better or for worse, government documents to
look sort of boring and official. And that overproducing this
data might actually dampen its authority in sort of
a twisted sort of way. So just be thoughtful as we go through
this course that every industry is going to be different and everyone's
expectations of what documentation should look like would be different. For the purposes of this course,
this is not what we should be seeing. But it has struck me as I've
prepared this class that there can be a certain reassurance that
comes from unadorned table data. The second thing we want to think about
is minimizing the cognitive load. Now minimizing cognitive load
is a fancy-pants way of saying let's make it easier for
people to get what we're saying. We want people to not
have to work as hard. So if you think about how hard you
have to work the first time you meet Florence Nightingale visualization,
we want to streamline that experience. And we can do that in a couple of ways. We can simplify. We can
up the amount of white space. That's the space that doesn't have
any text or visualizations in it. We can be careful about not loading
too many things onto a graph with too many intervals and
too many units of measurements. And we can work on that middle piece
of how will we know that they know it, which is we can think about anticipating
what a novice user might ask and then designing around that anticipation. And I just want to reiterate,
this isn't like a quiz. We're not saying like I hope you can
find what's important in this data, we're actually going to
come out and tell them. And I bring this up because if you
are someone like me who came up through the humanities tradition, we are often
taught to couch what we believe or to do a bunch of lead-up before
we do the thesis statement. And this might feel a little bit jarring
to just say I can't believe I'm going to tell them, right in the header of the visualization. But you'll find that if your goal
is the user's understanding, then you find that it's
a different ballpark. So let's think about what it means to
really minimize the cognitive load. So this is a Wikimedia graphic about
incarceration rates of inmates. It's a nice long period of time
where they're tracking data. But there's also a lot going on in this
visualization, so it's kind of hard to know where our eye should land and
what's important and not important. And it's got this key
sticking out to the side. Let's take a look at what happened
when Lauren tidied it up a bit. Here what she's done is she decided
she would change the color scheme a little bit. So she thought well, I know that
Male and blue kind of go together. We'll talk more about color
in a little bit. And I know that Female and
pink kind of go together. And then I'm going to use this sort of
orangy color as sort of the intermediate to show overall across all incarcerated
folks what's happening with the rate. We've changed the header here,
and we've come right out and said the issue here is male levels of
incarceration are up significantly. And the reason that the overall rate of
incarceration is going up is not because of female inmates so much as the fact that
we are incarcerating so many more males. Now we could have simplified this even
further by streamlining the x axis or the y axis as well, but we've just made
a significant change from here to here. And you'll notice I have changed the size
of the visualization a little bit just so it would fit in our format once
we made that header bigger. So you remember this example as well
where we tucked the data inside the number to reduce the overall
thinking someone would have to do. And again, we have this header and
subheader that tell us exactly what we want people to get
out of this visualization. Now I wish I had a rule or
a rubric about how much labels you need. And the best advice I can give, is that
you've got to Goldilocks your labels. You want not too much, so I probably
don't need if I have a timeline of all the months on the x axis I probably
don't need January, February, March. I probably just need Jan Feb Mar or JFM. I don't need a slanted x axis label
that's ugly, but also not too little. Part of why I would use Jan Feb Mar
as my labels is because JFM might not make it as clear. So you're going to have to experiment
with a just right version. Sometimes you need more text but
you can make the font smaller or use a thinner weight font. Sometimes you just have
to say the whole word. And that's going to bring this lesson to
a close, I'll see you in the next video.
