Now let's talk a little bit
about visual considerations. So our goal here is to
have visual elements that work cohesively together
to support your argument. So we're going to think about fonts and
colors and graphics and designs. And a lot of this carries over from
the third week of this class, but where I really want to concentrate for
this week is on this idea of mobile. So increasingly, we know that people are
accessing video conferencing software or webinars or online presentations
of one kind or another on a phone device and not
on a desktop screen. So as you are planning
the appearance of your slides, I would highly encourage you to think
about how to simplify things so that they can be seen in
a very small setting. So you want to think about
things like larger fonts, which can be a good move anyway, because
we have an aging population, and so eyesight is not our strong suit. You want to think about less text but
more slides to compensate for that. So less text that I need
to read all at once. So no cramming a ton of text
on a slide that I can't see because I'm looking at a screen
the size of a deck of cards. And more slides not only helps me
maximize comprehension and that big font, it also keeps the visual landscape
moving, which helps keep our audience more engaged in
what we're talking about. It also may mean that you need to
bump up the size of your labels so that they are larger than they would
have been in your technical report. You also want to think about
are there required corporate or organizational branding requirements. So we talked in an earlier week
about brand standards as a way of standardizing colors and logos and
how they're used in an organization. And so you will want to keep those
in mind as you come up with this. Sometimes there's even a PowerPoint kit
of designs that are already approved. If you don't have those restrictions, then
one thing you might want to think about if you don't do your own design is to use fresh templates that people
haven't seen 100 times. So going outside what's in PowerPoint or what's in Google Slides to just make things
spark and look a little bit fresher. So I like slidescarnival.com,
some people design slides in canva.com, that's C-A-N-V-A.com. I like SlidesCarnival, because it can
easily become a PowerPoint template or a Google Slides template, so it gets us moving really quickly. And people point out that they
noticed that it's a fresh design. And it just gives sort of a nice way
to emphasize your sense of freshness and currency. Make sure that you if you are sharing data
that you've gathered as part of a funded project, also known as a grant, there may be rules about where their
logo needs to appear, how your project needs to acknowledge the funder, and
you'll want to ask about those as well. Oftentimes those logos appear either
on a separate slide after the agenda or they appear on the very final slide
where you've got your major points and your questions and contact information. I do recommend that you check your work,
so you can do that in a couple of ways. You can adjust the view of
your slide software so you're only looking at a very tiny slide. Or actually have a rehearsal event and log
in with your phone while you're practicing so you can see what it looks like
on your presentation screen and what it looks like on your mobile screen. And this is just another reminder
of the importance of being clear about what you're trying to communicate. So here is an example of a graph
that I threw together in FRED. You guys know I'm a big fan of
the FRED economic data repository at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. And the green line shows
the total value of charitable donations that have been
reported to the IRS over time. And the blue line at the bottom shows the number of returns
that itemized deductions. And so what you can see in this graph is
you can see that the amount of money of donations is up, but not the number
of people making those donations. And I think this data is really
interesting, but when I look at this on a mobile device, I just can't see some
of this information. It's just too tiny. Now let's look at how we've adjusted
this so it's friendlier on mobile. We've stripped out a lot of
the other information. We've swapped out that scrubbable
timeline at the bottom. We've stripped out the header that
said FRED on it and instead moved that citation to appear in text format
in a very light version of the font. And we've remade the labels so
that they're a little bit larger. And I just did this by putting the
original image in PowerPoint and making text boxes to sit on top of the existing
text to make sure I was staying accurate. You could also use a variation of Lauren's
strategy that she showed you in the video in Week 3 and trace the existing
image and then make new labels for it. But here you see we've really
stripped down how much stuff people have to take in and we've made it
more viewable on smaller devices. Now there are going to be times when maybe
you have proprietary visualizations, or you have specific visualizations that
continually are used to benchmark your organization or your company. If there is no way to
shrink a visualization or to simplify it so it
looks good on mobile, you are going to have to realize
that you'll have to spend extra time to describe it. So we've used the coxcomb example,
the Florence Nightingale example, in Week 3 and you saw it in
the data visualization course. That's a graphic that would take
a long time to describe, which in Victorian England people
had time for. If there's no other way to
make that data apparent, and you remember from Week 3
there are ways to do that, then you need to be able to explain
what each of the rays means, what each of the colors mean. I don't like that approach, I like using simple visualizations
that people understand. Because when we have to tell people
how to interpret the thing we made, the potential for condescension, or for people to feel condescended to even if
it's not an accurate feeling, is increased. So really try to think about
how to make things simple. And remember that even the most
complicated data dashboards, as we looked at in Week 3, they feature
very simple communication structures.
