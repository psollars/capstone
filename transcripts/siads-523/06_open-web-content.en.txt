Now that you have access
to all that amazing data, let's not overlook that sometimes open web
content is really helpful. So for example, you might go to the Kendall County
Election Board site and look at how
people have voted. Here's some other
places that might be useful for you as you move
through this project. First, I think for our
restaurant project, Yelp is a tremendous resource. First, it has reviews. I always think I can
figure something out about a community by how many times
McDonald's is reviewed. It shows you maps, and it shows you peer
institutions or organizations. So from you doing a Yelp
search, for example, Lauren did it and told me
that she found that on Yelp there are a lot of low-budget fast food restaurants like the Burger Kings
and the McDonald's. But there weren't really any in this tier, the Chick-fil-A, Baja Fresh, Panera level. And that becomes a
really important factor because if you're going to
be the first upscale in a community, that might be a
heavier lift than if you are the second or the third and that market is preprimed for you. You might find it useful
to look at Google Maps. That can tell you everything from what else is going on
in the neighborhood, to what parking looks
like in that strip mall, to proximity to highways. Sometimes that is just
a really fast way to figure things out
about a community. You may find that looking at local newspapers can be helpful. Some of them have
limited access or they have delayed access
at the local level. But this would give you a sense of what kind of zoning
things are going on, what kinds of arguments are
going on at city council. You can also look to social media and obviously to
government websites. It can be really
interesting to monitor the kinds of things the
government is tweeting about, what kinds of issues are the
police dealing with, the library or the school, or the Chamber of Commerce. All of these are things
where I can't draw as direct a line as I
can with FRED to say this will be helpful
to tell you that, but we find over and over
when we do this kind of work, when we're looking
at communities, that this kind of information
can help to flesh out the things that data doesn't reveal in its
more traditional forms. All right. That's all the data
discussion we're going to have. You're always welcome to
off-road beyond that, but hopefully you're now in
a position where you feel kind of excited about
making a recommendation.
