Welcome back. Now
let's take a look at that JEGS brand document, so we can get a sense of
what kind of brand standards we might need to
consider in our work. So this is the PDF online
for the brand standards. This is the first page, is 36 pages here altogether, making this a longer document that you will find
for all brands. Now you can choose in
this course to make up your own brand standards to use the existing colors that
are in the templates. So this is more of what
you'll need for the future. Let's take a look
anyway and see how it can be valuable to you
in your future work. So you might look
at brand standards from two perspectives. One, you work for a company and you want
to make sure that your public-facing and
internal messaging are consistent with
the organization. Secondly, that you might be doing this as a client
and you want to know, "Can I lean into certain
colors or certain emotions or certain values that will make my presentation more
appealing to my client?" So what I love about these brand standards is all of the narrative
that's built-in. You don't find these in
all brand standards. But here's an
introduction and from the beginning that this is about family, business and racing. If we go to the next page, we get this auto dial as
a metaphor throughout and it will pop up at various
aspects of the piece. Again, we're not right
into the content yet, but first they're going to
talk about brand identity. This is really cool
because in this case, they've chosen to give
us a little history of the organization. So this way they could
hand this off to a new designer or to a
television advertising company. They've got this packet with
all of this information. Here you see that they've
even brought the mission, vision, and values here. So now I can start to get a
sense of what do they like. They like family competition,
strong business, great customer service
and that it is a family business and a family
is really important here. Talks a little bit about
who are they trying to appeal to in their products? So imagine if Chicken Kitchen had a brand standards document. This would really help us align their internal audience or their internal definition
of an audience with the persona data that we looked at from Experian Mosaic
within demographics now. Then they talk a little
bit about brand strategy, all the different
ways that they are currently communicating
their brand to others. Here's where we really
start to get into the classic brand
standards documentation. That's what they
start to talk about what they call
brand architecture. Here they're going to start talking about the ways in which their various projects
relate to one another. So here is more messaging
about what's important. Here again, I can start to
see that if I'm going to be making a presentation
to this company, I'm going to really want
to look at things like quality shows up a
couple of times here. Ideas of heritage, competition
not being a dirty word, again, all of which is going
to give me that insight. Here's the words
they like to use. I can use those in
preparing my reports and presentations and really tap into then emotionally some of
the values that they have. Skip forward a little bit. Here's even messaging
that can be used. Now let's go to the visuals. Here's where you really want
to be thinking about things. So here you'll
notice that they're telling you when should you
use the black and white logo? When should you use
the color logo? Specifically, what
are the CMYK colors that are being used? CMYK colors, you can
actually stick those into your slide software when you do things like the
color picker logo, when you pick more colors
from the color tab, there's often a
place where you can either use sliders to adjust the CMYK or you can
type in the values. This way your presentation will be exactly the right colors. It also talks a little bit, in this case about how much
white space there should be around the images and
what size it can be. So I do a lot of work with the Institute of Museum and
Library Services and one of their brand standards
is the logo should never appear in print less
than one inch in size. It talks about other ways
that you can use the logos. Also, and this is
really important ways you should not use the logo. So for example, here we see, don't make the crown
a different color. Here we have a colors
we should avoid, and it explains why. So again, someone new can
come into the company and know exactly what's expected. It also talks about which
are the fonts that are used in this company and even
examples of them in. So they say, here are
the two company fonts. So if I'm preparing an
external presentation, I better make sure
these fonts are installed on my device,
on my computer. Also talks about colors again. Now it's going to talk here
about two different colors. Here it talks about
the PMS color. This is the Pantone color. This is a color system you often hear about Pantone
color of the year. It is mostly used for communicating colors
for printing purposes, but often gets used in the home decor and
architecture world as well. Again, we see the
CMYK colors as well, so we can match exactly
our documentation to those standards. This is why I love the
JEGS word so much. It even talks about
how the photographs should look for
this organization, that these are all of
the approved logos. It just goes on and on. Even talks about where
they sponsor race cars, where logos and stuff should be and what color they should be, even things like apparel. So hopefully what you see here is that someone has
gone through and already thought about everything
from what the labels on the boxes would look like to what the stickers on the race
car would look like, so that we get something
that's consistent over time. So if your organization
has brand standards, you want to and you
need to do this kind of work and you don't have
templates preprovided. It's a really nice way
to make things look aligned and to make
your work look consistent across
the organization. If you're lucky
enough to work for an organization that's
provided templates for you, which we have, you won't have to worry about this so much. I hope you'll also start
looking up some of your favorite companies
to see if they've published their brand
standards online. Not everybody does, but it's a really fun way to think about what does it mean
to identify a brand. Maybe it'll even translate into your own social media presence. So that's what it is
about brand standards. The colors, the fonts, the look, the size, the whitespace that we need to make work in our presentations. So I hope you enjoyed
this detour and I'll see you back to continue our
conversation about color.
