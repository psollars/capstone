Hi. Welcome to Communicating
Data Science Results. In the next four weeks, we're going to be
talking about ways in which you move from
being an analyst to being someone who talks about and reports
their data back out. So let's get started
with an introduction of what you can expect in
the next four weeks. This week, you'll have an
introduction to the course. We'll talk a little bit
about the mindset of the course and why we
structured it the way we did. We'll introduce you
to the project scenarios that you'll use in various ways throughout the
entirety of the course. We'll talk a little
bit about data that will help fuel your ability to
complete this project, which I hope will
introduce you to some data sources
that will come in handy for you in future projects. And finally, we'll talk about
this week's assignment, which is creating an
executive summary, a one-page document,
that expresses your recommendation for the
scenario that you're given. I want to start by
telling you a little bit about my own work. I am not a data scientist. I do not use Python to
find insights in data. But what I do instead is I'm interested in data
literacy and what kinds of skills people need to develop to be good consumers of data, to be good readers of data, and to be good
communicators with data. And I hope that this
is helpful for you in the course because
we are always going to be talking in this course
about preparing materials for novices to understand
and feel respected by. I've written both for adults and for children on
issues of data literacy. So our goal in this course is to turn the data analysis
into reports. And I really want to emphasize
the word translation here. We want to translate the
complexity of the data that you found into insights that
make sense for other people. So right from the get-go, I want to say that our goal is not to say, look what I did, here's what I found, devoid from the target audience. That really thinking
with the audience in mind is a big objective
of this course. So over the course of
the next four weeks, we're going to be
looking at these four themes and they'll sort of come and go throughout the
entirety of the semester. The first thing is really
focusing on our audience. Who is the target audience
of the information that you found and the
recommendations that you're making? What do they know? What's their
technological expertise? What do they care about? And how can we use that
information to craft something that's more
customized for the recipient? Secondly, we're
going to talk about storytelling with data
in a couple of ways. We'll talk about
simple strategies to help your audience see what
is important in the data. We'll talk about
strategies to highlight data in visual format. We'll talk about strategies for framing data when we
present in an oral way. And then we'll talk
about technical report writing and how that contributes to your
communication toolkit. And that brings us
to our third theme, which is this technical report, which is a fancy way of
saying a document that talks about what you found and what you recommend in the
scenario that you give. And this is a document that's
attractive to look at, but that doesn't require sophisticated graphic
design software or a graphic designer. We've tried intentionally
to keep things very simple and very
achievable for you with things like
templates and recommended font stylings so that it's really easy for you to make
something that looks good, because nicely packaged
information always goes a little extra far. And in the fourth big theme, we're going to think about how we communicate in an
oral presentation. And as this is an online course, we're going to talk
about how you present on line in a webinar format, sometimes called a video
conference, where you don't have a live audience in front of you and you're talking into
your screen instead. We'll talk a little
bit more about design. We'll talk about
public speaking tips, including what happens when
you get a case of nerves. And we'll talk
about setting up an environment that is
warm and welcoming, and where you know how to
facilitate question and answer. Here's how we'll sequence
each week of the course. This week, we're going to
look at your scenario, and then we're going to look at some sites for demographic
and consumer data, as well as some economic
and government data. You'll use that to determine
the recommendation for which way you recommend that the executive
you're writing for, which direction they should go. And then we'll talk
about writing that up in a single-page executive summary. That'll be the first week. Week 2 is going to be
our lightest week. That's about drafting
a technical report. That's the nuts and
bolts of what we say, how we say it, and how we
organize it on the page. We'll provide some templates to make that look really sharp, but you're always welcome to
go off-roading if you like. In the third week,
we're going to talk about visualizations
and we're going to build on some of the
work that you've done in previous classes
for how we can make visualizations that
highlight what's important to see in the data, and that use design as
a communication tool, not just as a decoration tool. And finally, we'll close
out the course in the fourth week
by talking about online presentations
and you will deliver a recorded presentation
as your final assignment. To help us along the way, we're going to use this textbook, Knaflic's Storytelling with Data. This is a really friendly
book that I think you'll really like having
on your bookshelf, virtual or physical, as
you go through things. Knaflic is a visualizer for those data
visualizations for Google, and she really does a really
nice job walking you through her processes for how she goes about
communicating data using very simple formats as you can see from the
cover of this book. So our mindset here is that the course is
about communication. So the focus is not on data
crunching or using Python, or even using Excel or Google Sheets in any kind of
sophisticated way. So there are no assigned Jupyter notebooks
because most of the data you're going to be
looking at has already been analyzed and
packaged for you. Now, they're available
if you want them, but we're not going to
support them in this course, because our focus is on how
we communicate to and for others with words,
visualizations, and speech. And we've pre-suggested some sources of data
for you to use, and we'll walk you through those this week in the lecture. A variety of resources that I think you will find valuable
beyond this course. So software you'll need for this, you'll want to have
access to Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel is fine. These are very minor
pieces of the puzzle, but they're very helpful
if you are looking at, say, census data
that's in a table, and you want to very quickly figure out what it might
look like visualized. You will want access to Google Presentations or
Microsoft PowerPoint. We're going to use
that not only for your webinar or video
conference slides, but we're also going
to use that as our graphic design tool for laying out your technical report and your executive summary. In a few cases, you might need to use Inkscape, which is an open source
version of Adobe Illustrator, which is a pretty high-powered
graphic design tool. You're welcome to use
Illustrator if you like. This is when you see data that's already been visualized
by someone else and you literally
want to trace it, and divide it into layers
so that you can edit it in a way that makes
more sense for you. The data you choose to use in the project will determine
whether you need that, and we've got a
really great tutorial to help you with that if you
get into that situation. You can communicate
with our team. Make sure you see the notes on the syllabus about
the Slack channel. Take advantage of using Office Hours. We've
got lots of ideas of extra things we can talk about when it comes
to communication. It's a great chance to do Q&A, and if the attendance is low, we can even look at some
of your work in process and do some peer critiquing. We do ask that you keep
away from email as your number one choice
for communication, only because we don't want you to get. lost in our ever-growing inboxes. So here's what we're going
to try to do in this course. I'm a huge fan of this
book that came out in fall 2019 by Nancy Duarte
called Data Story, where she really
talks about a lot of the processes regarding
communication of data. And she talks about data
scientists being on a continuum with three elements: explore, explain, and inspire. Explore is the type of work
you've already been doing. The number crunching, the
running the Python scripts, the trying to make sense
of the data you have. Then the next stage in that process is as you
move up the hierarchy, as you become more
advanced in your career, you move to then explaining to somebody on your team
what that means. And where we want to
get in this course is this concept of Inspire, that you're actually
the one saying, I've run all this data. Now
I'm going to present you with my argument so that you are inspired to take the
action that I recommend. And for some of you, this is an
extension of how you see yourself as a data scientist,
and for some of you this is a slightly different role that you'll be playing
throughout the course. So it's a good time to point out that all of you come from
different disciplines. Some of you have been doing
written reports for decades, or you give tons of presentations and you feel
really strong in those skills. Some of you are really adept with graphic design, and
some of you are not. So I ask you to be thoughtful as you move through the course. You may not be the target
audience for a beginner lesson, but someone else in
the room might be. So let's talk a little bit about data storytelling or
storytelling with data. You hear this term a lot
bandied about when you travel in conversations
about data and design. So one thing is that storytelling
with data is a kind of bridge. You have your technical results, you have an audience
that needs to know about that information and be empowered to make a
decision about it, that's where that
Inspire piece comes in, and your goal is to figure
out how to communicate that. So storytelling is a
communication device. Storytelling with data is
also about making your aha moments visible to others. If you've ever looked at a really complicated
line graph and there's things of all
different colors and the lines are going up and
down and cross each other, and you've had that
instinctive of like, "What is going on here?" Then you were in need
of data storytelling. So in this case it means sculpting information so that people see what's important
the way you saw it, especially given that novice level that we're
going to assume that your executive audience
has in this course. Finally, when we start thinking
about oral presentations, we start thinking
about addressing both the heart and the
mind of the audience. So a technical report
is pretty cut and dry. It's an analysis. It has evidence and data that
back up assertions. When we go to an
oral presentation, we start bringing in
some other elements that help make an
environment that's conducive to people warming to your decision and
your recommendation. So in this case
storytelling with data is a way of addressing
that heart piece. How did we get people to care about the thing
that we care about? How do we get people
invested in that? How can we get them engaged with what the data is showing us? And how do we get them
inspired to take action? And finally, Duarte says,
"Storytelling with data is stories so powerful others can recall
and retell it," right? So we are looking at
ways in which we are sharpening our toolkit,
sharpening the saw, as Steven Covey would say, to be able to create worlds in which this data
communication is happening. Now I want to be very
clear that storytelling with data is not
making up fiction. So it is not creating
your own set of data or manipulating data in a
way that's not ethical, or inaccurate, or incomplete. And that's probably a
question you want to ask yourself as you go
through this work is, "Am I portraying
this data in a way that's authentic to
the original dataset? Or am I kind of cutting some corners so that the data tells the story I want to tell?" We've all been on
the receiving end of political arguments or commentary where you feel like someone's sort of pulling your strings to get you to think
a certain way. That's not our goal. Our goal is not to
get you to say yes at any cost or get your audience
to say yes at any cost. Instead, what we're
interested in is sculpting what's there so that it remains authentic and it
remains accurate, and we don't fall afoul
of unethical behavior. So it's also perhaps useful to think about, going back to
the Duarte Data Story book again, three levels
of decision-making. So right now you're
probably dealing mostly with the first two. One is discrete decision-making. That means you've got a question. You can spend a few minutes in a dataset and it finds
the answer for you. Sometimes I think
about this as like, "Let me just check
my gut on that." So that tends to be
more procedural, and more sort of
every day what you do. When we think about
operational decision-making, we often think of that
in terms of dashboards. I'm just looking at where
the data overall is going. I'm kind of checking to make sure
that things are kind of status quo. I'm looking to see if
there are any changes that mean that maybe we need
to look a little deeper. What I want you to think
about in this course is moving to strategic
decision-making, which means that
you're really digging deeply into the data
so that you can make a strong analysis that
you've synthesized well, either orally, or visually, or in text, and that has an impact to make a significant decision
about an organization, or effort, or initiative. So strategic is
where we are going to concentrate ourselves today. Now in this course, you're going to use scenarios. There will be a variety of scenes from which you can
choose where you want to go. Each of them will
require that you look at both proprietary and
government data to determine, based on
your best judgment and your best analysis, what the correct path
should be moving forward, and what the first steps
towards that path should be. So you'll notice that those
are in your course shell. What we're going to do
now is give you a chance to take a look
at those scenarios, and then we'll come back and
get started in our work.
