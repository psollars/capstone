Welcome back. Now we're
going to focus a little bit on the design elements of
the executive summary. You notice from looking at the sample in the
previous slide that it definitely is a
visualized document, even if you're just
filling in the template. In fact, Duarte suggests that
slidedoc templates be made available at the organizational
level and then they get reused over and over
and over again in various configurations
with various layouts. Here is where we are with current design trends with fonts. You're seeing a lot of
design with sans serif fonts. And serifs are like those little lines that are at the bottom of an f or the top of a t. If it doesn't have
these little lines at the ends of the letters, then it's called sans
serif, without the serif. And what's more popular
now is to take a single font and use
multiple variations on it. Different line weights,
different sizes, bold and italics,
or in some cases, mixing almost identical fonts. So you'll see an example
where we use Helvetica Neue, which is what this slide is
written in, for the headers. It's big, it's bulky. I like that a lot. But when I go to do text, sometimes I like text
that's a little slimmer, so I can fill a little
more text in the column. You can take a look whether you like that matching or not. If you think about how we often learned to write research papers, that we would have
headers in Arial and we would have text
in Times New Roman. We're not quite in that era. And the reason that
we're going to talk about fonts is because you've all gotten some kind of document, some kind of visualization,
where it's entirely clear they made it in Microsoft. It's got that Microsoft
blue and orange, it's got the Calibri font or the Cambria font, and so
it looks just kind of everyday. And our goal here is for
your work to stand out because there are visual elements involved that take it to
up to the next level. And these are all
things you can do without being a graphic designer. Obviously, if you're in
a company that does need graphic design or you're
working for a big client, you would then talk
back and forth with the graphic designer
about timelines and needs and style and they would help
craft that around you. If it's just you, this why I like
Helvetica Neue, for example, and why I've used
it throughout this course. And that's because
with a single font, I can get it to look all
of these different ways. So I could do a caption
in an ultralight or thin, but I'm going to use
bold for the headers. But if I needed to
squeeze a lot of stuff into a small subheader, I could use a condensed font. This is the kind of thing that you
are going to be looking for. And some cool fonts
you have to pay for and some fonts you
can download for free. And we're going to look
at a few of each. So a couple of fonts
that you can purchase. One is classic Helvetica, the classic twentieth
century Swiss font. The Microsoft version
of this is Arial, and Arial does look just different enough from
Helvetica and Helvetica Neue that it can reduce some of the specialness, but if it's
what you got, you can use it. I also like Frutiger.
I like Segoe, which looks a lot like Frutiger. They're both kind of tall fonts. I don't own both of these, so I can't show them to you. I had a student use
Brandon Grotesque. And there's a wonderful
reference guide for fonts called Typewolf, which will keep you
introduced to what's new. Now let's take a look at what you might play with in Google Drive. And remember that every font has its own personality and every font might have
a better purpose. So some of these
look more formal, some of these look a
little bit more playful. Now, what I've done is
I've shown you what each one looks like
in just a basic font, then I've shown it
in all caps, and then I've shown it in a
sample sentence. So for example, I really
like out of this collection, I use Raleway a lot, although sometimes that
it is a really wide font, so sometimes it takes a lot
of space to use Raleway. And I really like Nanum Gothic
because it looks the most like the font
the Economist uses, which is a proprietary font. Segoe looks a little like
that, and so does Frutiger. We're going to look
at what happens when we use Montserrat. I think there are really great
times to use it and there are times when it's
maybe not the best type. You are, of course, welcome to explore other forms as well. What we are really
encouraging you to do is just to bring a little style
into your font choices. And here are some that I like that you could download if you like. And I think it's a lot of fun to pick out different fonts, so take the time to get something
that looks good to you. Now, this is my
"absolutely not" list, with the exception
being if it's in your company's style guide
to do it, then it's okay. Now, Arial is on my don't
use list because I have other fonts that look a little bit more
stylish than Arial, but a lot of folks
still use it and in the right weight and at
the right size, it's okay. So it's all right
to be on your list, just not on my list. I take Calibri and Cambria off. Those are the two Microsoft
fonts, and I can avoid those. Courier looks like a typewriter. That's not very graphically
appealing in a report. And Times New Roman
is the expected, and I'd rather look at something
a little bit different, It goes without saying
that we're not going to use cute fonts. If you remember seeing Avatar, that logo was done in Papyrus. It's like a little theme. We don't need to do that. We don't need to have like
fancy cursive letters or curlicues. And this one's the real deal breaker,
never Comic Sans. Now I know a lot of teachers use Comic Sans when they
send notes home. But the reality is that when you're writing a
letter to a grownup, Comic Sans does not command
a lot of authority. So we're taking that off
the list completely. Now let's go on and talk about
preattentive attributes. And this is a kind of funky
term that refers to the font styles and colors and other things that
clue our lizard brain into noticing some things
more than others. I'm going to walk you through
the ones from the textbook, and we'll talk about each of them and what
the impact might be. I'm going to do this
because we're trying to minimize the cognitive
work for the reader. We're trying to make sure that they can quickly discern what's important and what isn't and to focus their
attention there, even in something as small
as the executive summary. Let's take a look
at this question of preattentive attributes
and use of different fonts. So this is the same
Declaration of Independence paragraph
that you're going to see many times in many forms. And in this form, all
I've done is use bold to separate the headline
from the text itself. So the bold tells our
eye to look to the top first, and nothing
more to say here. Here's what it would look like. This is a free downloadable
font, Webly Sleek UI. It's a much narrower headline, but the body text looks great. It's thin, there's lots
of white space around it, it's easy to read. I don't love to use
this font for a header. I would tend to use a Helvetica Neue because
it looks a little too much like Calibri and that looks a little bit too
standard for my taste. So here they are
combined together. I kind of like that look. So here we have the same Helvetica I showed
you before. No changes. Let's make an adjustment, and each of these will focus on a different piece of text,
if you want to keep track. So one thing we can do is we
can just change the color of certain text and now that
one piece stands out. We could bold this text, it would stand out even more. We could make a font bigger, and suddenly that becomes
the most important thing. We could put boxes around it. This is the approach that
your textbook author uses and I used to do these
in PowerPoint. I'd draw a shape and then
I'd make sure there's no fill and then I'd play around with the
line weight a little bit. I don't love this. This is not my aesthetic, but it might work for you. I would rather have
sort of a highlight effect. And those are the same boxes
from the previous slide, but this time I
took the line away, I added a fill, and I made the transparency of the
color about 50 percent so that it wouldn't
be so intense that it would sort of blare at you
when it came out. You can bold text
within the paragraph. You can underline.
Not my favorite either, but sometimes
you need some variety. You can italicize. Now in this case I
italicized and I bolded it because just italicizing
didn't make it stand out. So I often do use
those two together. You can see how drawing out one thing is actually making you look more closely at one line of the
text than another. You can space things out with the assumption that whatever's between
the blank lines is really important. This is technically not 100 percent
grammatically correct, so you'd want to use
this one sparingly. You could also, and this
one's not in your book, you can divide things
into multiple columns. And what this does is it
makes it easier to scan from the beginning
of the line to the end. And one of the things you
want to think about, if we go back and
look at this one, you can see that from
the beginning of the slide to the
end of the slide, that's a lot of words, right? And if we make it
a little shorter, we can actually skim through the lines a little
bit more quickly. But it's also possible
to overdo this to the point that you
only have two or three or four words on a line, and then it becomes very hard to get into a rhythm of
understanding what's being said. Here too, we've changed
the title to see if that would draw out any extra
oomph from things. Here we've switched fonts, that's the Webly
Sleek font we added, and we added this shaded box. Again, just drawing a shape in PowerPoint and filling
it in with a text. This is also Webly Sleek, but it's an italicized
version of it. Way to trivialize the
Declaration of Independence, huh? But super-interesting. With each of these, you
should be feeling like your response to
them is different, and you'll want to play
around with what when you're doing your work
is the best way to go.
