In this video I'm going to show you how
to trace an image into Inkscape and manipulate a little bit of text. So to start off we'll have
a new document in Inkscape. I'm going to click File and then Import. I'm going to import an image
I've already saved elsewhere. In this case, it's going to be
the Frederick_household_income.png file that I have from
the DemographicsNow website. I'm going to open it up. For the Image Rendering Mode
I'm going to select Smooth just to optimize the quality
of it, not the speed, since it's not too big of an image,
so it's pretty easy to import. So I'm first going to
drag my image over onto what I'm going to call an art board. Other image editing programs also
kind of call it an art board, but I'm not sure what Inkscape calls it. Anyways, the main point is that
I've opened up my image. It's here now. It's going to be showing us
the household by income group. Households by income group, kind of
percentage amount for Frederick County. So there's a couple things that I
want to change about this image. So I'm not digging it. One is the colors. I'm not a super huge fan of them and
I kind of also want to emphasize the households that
are earning 75,000 and above. So I'm going to do that by using color. And then I also kind of want to change the
title of the graph right now because right now it's telling me it's households
by income group, and that's great, but it's not telling me for what county. And so, for example, if I had one
of these for Kendall County and one of these for Frederick County,
I'd want to make sure that the image that I'm using shows exactly which county
I'm referring to in a very clear way. Which the image that's automatically
generated by DemographicsNow does not do. So first things first. I'm going to trace the image that I have. So I'm going to select the image,
I'm clicking on it and then I can either right-click and
then Trace Bitmap. Or I can go to Path at the top of
my screen and then Trace Bitmap. I prefer to do the right-click version. So I'm going to do right-click,
Trace Bitmap. It's going to pop up this
new window and so here is where I kind of start
doing my customization. So you can either do a
single scan or multiple scans. If you do multiple scans, you'll be
able to pull out different colors. So in this case, I kind of mess
around with a couple other things. So in this case,
I'm going to do multiple scans. I'll select that and
then I will shift over to Colors. And then the number of scans that
you have kind of affects the number of colors that it picks out. So if your image has a bunch
of different colors, you'll want to have
a higher number of scans. If you have fewer colors you'll be able to use a lower
number of scans if you'd like. There's not really too much of
a difference when you get to the higher numbers, as long as your image
kind of shows what you want. But I kind of like
an average amount of scans. Like I said, I'm not really
sure what average is. But in this case average is going to
be eight since that's the default. I want to stack my scans
all on top of each other. I'll be doing something
later to ungroup them. But for right now,
I do want to stack them. And then I personally don't
want to smooth corners and I don't want to ignore
small spots and speckles. So in order to kind of see like
what I'm probably going to get, I'm going to hit this Update button. And so then on the right side, you'll see a preview of what your
Trace Bitmap will produce. And so if you notice, I will go and
lower the number of scans so that it's down to three and
I'll update this. And you'll notice here that by
moving it down to three you lose some of the information in
the graph because of the colors. And so you'll see that the lines
behind the bars are gone. And the text itself is
actually not black any more. It is now kind of this
purple blue color. So if I increase the number of scans,
maybe up to four, and update it, not much has really changed. The colors for the text is
getting closer to black. I update to five and I'll notice that
some of this other stuff is coming in, the gray around the graph and
some of the tick marks and a little bit of shadowing that was
present in the original image. I move it up to six and you'll notice
that the lines start coming in behind it. If I moved up to 20 and I updated it,
not much has really changed at that point. So it kind of seems like six to
seven is maybe a sweet spot. I'm going to bring it back down to
eight since that looks just fine. And now that I'm happy with
what I want to do, I'll hit OK. And so that should create the image. And then I'm going to select the closest
dock on the right-hand side. And so now I should have two images. The trace image should be directly
on top of the original image. So I'm going to click on it and
then drag it down to see. And yep, looks like there is
an image missing now. There is now an image, two of them. So I can click the original image and
then hit Delete so that we don't have to deal
with that one anymore. I'm going to select the newly
traced image and so something to note is that this
is currently a stack of images. So it's grouped kind of funky right now. So I'm going to go ahead and
right-click and then ungroup the images. You can also ungroup by going to
Object and then Group or Ungroup. And you'll notice there are all
these different lines. Each line is a different scan. And so if I click off of the image, that
kind of disappears. And if I click back on. I had clicked directly into
the purple and so you'll notice at the bottom there's this
fill section is that's the fill color. If I move this off you'll notice
that all of the purple comes with. But there's more things than
you'd expect to be purple. So, for example, we had our purple bars,
but also everything behind the blue is purple as well because
of the way that it was traced. So I'm going to hit undo just make sure
that that's kind of arranged nicely. So something to keep in mind is
that this tool is really good for if you want to do kind
of like light manipulation. So if I wanted to change a couple things
about the colors, that's totally good. If I wanted to try and move things around
physically, it's not as great at that. But that's kind of what happens
when you do automatic tracing. You can also do manual tracing, but
that's not what this video is covering. And so just kind of like
as an FYI, that does happen. So what I want to do is I
want to update these colors. So the first thing I'm going to do
is click off of the image entirely. And then I'm going to
select the paint bucket. Actually, sorry. First thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to put a background on this. So there's a couple
different layers in here and layers is something that's pretty common
in a lot of image editing programs. And so we're currently on the first layer. I want to select all the objects. All of them, there we go. So I've dragged my cursor across
the images, all of the scans. I've highlighted them all. I'm going to go back and group them
really quick just to make sure that I'm good with doing this and then
I'm going to hit the layer button and I'm going to add a layer, and
the layer name is going to be Image layer. And so this is going to take
the item that I have right now and move it over to the Image layer. And I'm going to have it above the first
layer, and currently we're on Layer 1. So it'll be about the first layer.
I'm going to add that. You notice we have this Layer 1. I'm going to right-click. I'm going to make sure that it's on the
image and it's actually not in the image, it didn't come with it. So I'm going to move it. I'd right-click Move to Layer and then select Image because
that's where I want it to be. You can confirm that this
is true. Down at the bottom, there should be a little like
image label. It says current layer. So if I select off of it and I move down to Layer 1, I'm actually in
Layer 1 and I can't select the image. The reason I wanted to do this is because
I wanted to put a white rectangle behind everything just so
that any sort of work that I'm doing is there's nothing that's transparent. So I'm going to select that button,
the create rectangles and squares, and I'm going to kind of just drag it over and
behind household income by group. And so it starts off with this color. I personally don't really want that one. I want it to be white because I
want to kind of forget about it. So I'm going to select the white down at
the bottom and that'll change the color. I could also change it to red.
It's pretty harsh. So I'm just going to change
that right back to white and then I'm going to move off the layer. I'm going to go back
up to the Image layer, because I want to start
manipulating this image. So I'm going to select,
I'm going to ungroup again. And then I'm going to
click off of the image and then I'm going to select the paint bucket. So the paint bucket will
fill the bounded areas. And so I'm going to select it and
I'm going to actually select the 2024 purple layers. So that original is purple, we've just changed
it to white, and then I'm actually going to change the RGBA value to
something I picked out earlier. I'm going to type that in here really
quick, type it here, b20d46ff. There we go. And that's the color I
actually wanted here. So it's been filled in. I hit enter so
that it would update the value. And so I'm going to use that here in
the thousand K plus, and I'm also going to use that on the 75K to 99,999. I'm also then going to move to
the 50K, the next ring down. I'm going to change this value. So I selected it already. I'm changing the value so
that it updates the color. So let me update that color
real quick, c7527bff. There we go. And so now it's just kind of like this
slightly more muted color because I don't want as much focus to be put
on that one. And I'll go ahead and continue to select the other colors. It's a little bit hard to choose kind
of, this is kind of up to you. I'm going to then fill in the icon
down here because currently it's set up to kind of go by color, which is not
quite what we want at this point because we should probably update how we're being
labeled or how it's being labeled now, since we're changing the color. But that
is something else we can deal with later. Right now I want to actually group
all of these colors together to make sure that they stay together
if I ever I move things around. So if I move over back to the cursor item,
Select and transform objects, I'm going to select
multiple items at once. So I'm on a Mac, so on a Mac
the controls are Command-Shift. So I hold that down as I
select all the other items. You can confirm that this is working
if you see the little arrow icons in the corners kind of expanding. So
I've selected all the ones that I want. I'm going to right-click and
then I'm going to group them together so that if I move these, they come with me. I'm going to undo, so
that kind of stays together and back where it was originally. And then
I'm going to do the same thing for 2019, selecting off of the image,
selecting the paint bucket, painting the area. Well, that's funky,
it shouldn't have done that. I'm going to select all. Let me try this one more time. Interesting. So I'm currently selecting this object. Now I'd like to fill the bounded areas. That's actually the entire
layer that it was choosing. I'm going to undo, so Command-C in my case. And I want to not be selecting anything. So I'm probably clicking on
something that I shouldn't, so I'm going to try this one more time. I'm going to select a fill color to start
with, just to make sure that I've got something to begin with and
then I'm going to try this one more time. There we go. So I was probably clicking on
something that I shouldn't have. But, So I'm going to update this color because
that's a little bit too bright for me. It's not bad, but we actually are going to
go with a darker orange. So let me type that in, e68823ff.
There we go. It's a little bit more muted, a little
bit more easy for the eyes to see. I'm going to keep doing this same
change with the others. Again, I'm going to shift down to a lighter
orange again, ecaa8cff. There we go. So here we kind of have this more emphasis on the darker colors and not so much on the lighter colors. One other thing I need to do
before I do that is recolor that little guy, there we go. I'm going to choose both of these
are for the lighter colors, so we'll stick with that for now. So we're going to keep selecting,
Command-Shift all of them. Once more group this layer,
here we go. Okay. So now we've manipulated the colors, kind
of made it a little bit more pleasing to look at, and changed up the aesthetics
so that there's a little bit more emphasis visually on the parts
that we want to focus on. You could do this kind of drastically or
in a different way, but that's kind of how I was
imagining it currently. And I might change that later, but for the
first draft that is what makes me happy. So now I'm going to update
this image because, so we were talking earlier about how
this is for Frederick County, but you can't really tell that by
the current title of the graph. So I want to update this whole
Households by Income group. So I'm going to erase
what's there currently. So I'm erasing these existing paths. I'm just going to use the Eraser tool and draw over the current title so
that that goes away. One, two, three, it's thinking,
okay, there we go. Cool. Little smudge over here,
I'm going to get that out. And it figures out what paths were
there, and now that's gone. So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to then create and edit a text object.
I'm going to select that. I'm going to double-click and then
start typing. So, Frederick County. And this is pretty big,
I'm not a huge fan of that. I'm going to double-click and
bring this down to maybe 18. Okay, 18 is pretty good. I could probably switch this
around a little bit if I want, and that was towards the top,
that's the font size. I could change the font itself if I really
wanted, I could go to Apple Gothic. It's a little bit thinner. Maybe I don't want that,
maybe I want a thicker text, but Frederick County Household Income. And then it's getting a little bit long so I'm going to kind of clip this
down to two lines, By Group. So maybe that conveys the information.
Maybe I want to do something a little bit different, but I'm pretty okay with this right now. So I'm going to change
that text alignment, and I'm going to move it down to center text
so that it's a little bit more centered, because that's my preference. I'm going to move this up over so it feels a
little more centered on the graph as well. And so that looks pretty good. As you noticed, I just selected something
and it's actually back on Layer 1. That's that background. I'm going to drag this
up just a little bit, just to make sure that
all the text is captured. And then I think I'm pretty
happy with this so far. I could do some other changes. I could get rid of some of the other
text to kind of not have it tilted, because that's not great. And I could decide to change the labels at
the bottom, maybe a little more explicit. Put some more labels so that the graph
has an x axis and a y axis label. Currently, again, it doesn't really have that. But I'm okay with this for right now. So I'm going to save my file. So I can Save As, because I don't
want to save it as a New Document 1. I'm going to Save As, I'm already in
the folder that I wanted to put it in. The first file was what I was
originally working with, but now I'm going to say
Frederick_household_income_demo. Save it as a .svg file, and Save. So this will be a really easy
file to open with Inkscape again. However, if I want to have it as a file
type that's a little bit easier to handle when it's outside of Inkscape, I'm going to do File and
I'm going to export as a PNG image, because I kind of like those. And so you have a couple options. You can
export as the page, you can export just the drawing, maybe a selection of it,
maybe something else kind of custom. I'm going to do the drawing. And so my name is
Frederick_household_income_demo.png to kind of match the current file name. And it's going to go in that same
place that the original file went. And so then I'm going to hit Export,
it's exporting for me. So then we can double-check to
make sure that that worked as expected by going into the save folder. And then there's
the folder when I was making. Okay, cool, this is what I just made. And so we see it's a little bit
not desirable. There's a little something
funky going on. It's that whole erasing. Erasing the existing paths did a little something funky. It's not something that
we're noticing here, but it is something we're noticing
in the way that we export it. So I'm going to see, I'm going to go to image layer. I want to see what happens
if I select the text, move it around a little bit so
it's out of the way. And then I'm going to try and
add a new rectangle and square and see if this added it. So there's a little bit there,
that should cover the same area. I'm going to hit white so that it
kind of appears like it's not there. I'm going to move that text right back. And we'll notice that
there's some weird layering. So I'm going to see if I can
move this in front. So Object Properties is
not very useful for that. I think I'm going to try and
do a new layer. And so what I'm trying here is I'm
adding a new layer on top of Image, called Text. So that should, let's move this. So my expectation is that
it will be higher up. So it should actually go over,
like it does here. And now I'll be able to
kind of like move this higher, I'm going to zoom out a little bit. Okay, so that looks all right, let's see. Let's try this again. So I'm going to save this,
because I've updated it. I'm going to File and Export now. We're still going to use the same name. So I will export this drawing and I'll replace the old image because
I don't want to keep that. And hopefully this should fix things. And look at there, yep. So that corrected the issue. So sometimes you'll want to be careful,
well, not sometimes, but you'll want to be careful with
the erasing the path tool. And be mindful of what layers
you're on and doing things on. So in this case, I had to add a new
layer because what I had done and erased had actually
been on a level higher. And so even though it was transparent,
it didn't show the bottom layer, the background layer, which would
have been a white background and should have kind of held it steady. In this case I had to move
the text to a new top layer so that I could include
the new white box on that same layer where we had
previously erased the path. But my image looks pretty good. I can then crop this if I want to,
get rid of some of that shading. I could do more work elsewhere on it. But this is pretty good for
the first round of editing. And then I can get more feedback
from other people and see, like, does this make sense? Does this convey
the information that I'm expecting? Does it seem pleasing to them? And then go for a round 2.
