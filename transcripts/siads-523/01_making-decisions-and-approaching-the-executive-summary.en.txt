Okay, by this point you've looked at
census data, you've looked at trends, you've looked at profiles
of consumers in that area. You're starting to get a pretty decent
sense of these two communities. So it's time to make a decision. Now, as I've mentioned before, there
is always a certain amount of ambiguity in these scenarios,
so there is no correct answer. Data can often point us in
a couple of different directions. And in this case, I think the major thing that it does
is point out that we are looking at a community that's already really
well established with tons of restaurants and a community that's much smaller, but
growing at a really rapid rate. And it's going to be hard to
know which of those is correct. You want to ask yourself, what is my instinct telling me, where does
the data line up to match that instinct? And once again, what were
the priorities that were listed, and a lot of the priorities had to
do with community components. The sort of conservative culture,
the recent development, and available spending money. As we look at Kendall County, Texas, I sometimes think
pro/con charts are helpful. So in this case, the pros are
it's growing really fast. It is a conservative community, and we know profits correlate to conservative
voting for this organization. It's got high home values. It's got a high median household income, which speaks to the availability of
disposable income to spend on eating out. And it's got potential for
big growth if we are patient. However, it's currently a really small
market and the profits could be delayed. In which case, our
recommendation might have to do with, we might pursue this option
but not decide yet, and look at things like
how much does land cost? What does the building commission
say is going to happen? How much does it cost to sit on a piece
of land and not build it for a few years? Those would all be possible
action steps you could take. It doesn't have an interstate nearby, which means that most of the traffic is
going to be local as opposed to people passing through on their
way to someone else. There's not a university, which means we're not going to have
that constant influx of young people. We mentioned that tourism
goes with the interstate. It is a slightly shorter
commuter distance, which might mean slightly
less time in the car. And from our analysis
using Yelp and Google Maps, we know that it's a place that currently
doesn't have restaurants like ours. Meaning it doesn't have sort
of the Panera, the Baja Fresh, the Chick-fil-A sort of price point,
it's mostly the Burger King, McDonald's. But oftentimes those are the type of
restaurants that come someplace in later. In looking at the data and
running our pro/con choices, we decided to go with
Frederick County, Maryland. So that's our recommendation, and we feel
that we have lots of data to back that up. And what are our action steps going to be? So we might have action steps that
tell us the degree to which we're certain we should break ground here. So our action steps might have to do
with things that concern us still, even though we've made the recommendation. One recommendation might be where
should we look first in the county? Frederick city seems like an obvious
choice, it's the biggest one, it's where the university is,
it's where the interstates intersect. The second action step might be because
there are already two Chick-fil-A restaurants there, is there a need for a third upscale fast food restaurant that
sells chicken, as Chicken Kitchen does? Is that an asset or is that a challenge? We might need to do some consumer research
or some taste tests or some focus groups. We might need to start asking for
zip codes when people go to our other locations to see if they
happen to be from this area. And finally, we might need an action
step about can we afford to be here? We need to maybe know how much
the land costs, whether or not there is any available land, and whether, again, the places that we
could build are places that attract the population that makes
our restaurants a success. So even your action steps in a way are ways of giving more nuance
to your recommendation. Which makes sense. Professionals
would not do a soup-to-nuts market analysis in the four weeks
of the course. All right? So, we looked at all the data, we've got some action steps, let's
talk about writing the summary itself. So an executive summary frankly is
kind of what it sounds like it is. It is a short abridgement of a longer
report. It fits on a single page. And I always think it's
called executive because if there's only one page that your boss
reads, it's going to be this page. So it has to be both succinct,
so it fits on a page, and comprehensive enough that they can
get a big picture of what's going on. So if you have three action steps, you
will list them in your executive summary. And then in the fuller report,
you will kind of balloon that out and go into a lot more detail. So you have to be really judicious.
Some people actually write their executive summary last
after they've written the report. And some people write the executive
summary first because it gives you an outline that you can then use for
the larger report. So you'll need to play with
what works best for you. Again, we've talked about how
the executive summary is that sort of one-page summary overview. And sometimes it seems kind of silly that
you've got a page that tells you what you're going to learn on the next pages. But all I can say is if
you've ever seen Romeo and Juliet, it opens with someone coming
out and giving this prologue. And in the prologue, they absolutely tell
you, two young people are going to die and it's what keeps their families
from continuing their feud. So if it worked for Shakespeare and
it's worked for 300 years, I think it'll work for us as well. We're going to use a format that Duarte
talks about both in Data Story and in her earlier books, called a slidedoc. And hopefully this will add
some visual variety and help you think in new ways
about an executive summary. The first thing you want to know is that
this is a horizontally-focused document or a landscape-focused document. Oftentimes, when we write reports,
we write them portrait style, right? With the 11 inches of our
paper going up and down and the 8-and-a-half inches going across, if you're from another nation you
might have page shapes like A4, where usually it is taller than it is wide.
We're flipping that for this project. The advantage is that a lot of these things
are being read digitally right now, but we're still formatting our
reports like the olden days. So you're going to actually use
your presentation software and your document is going to
be wider than it is tall. We're also going to take advantage
of using multiple columns and we'll talk about that a little
bit further in our talk. We've made a template available to you if all you want to do is
populate it and format the text. You can also choose your own formatting. And again, we're going to keep it to
one page for the executive summary. Eventually, you'll return
to this document and build out the full technical
report after next week's lesson. So, executive summaries
have a lot of components. First, a title. And unlike in fiction, we're going to actually give a title
that signals the decision itself. We're going to try to
minimize as we do this work. We're trying to minimize the guessing
that the executive has to do. So we're going to have to play
a game of Captain Obvious here. You would have a subtitle that makes
it clear this is the executive summary, which is a signal that there
is more to it than this. You're going to give some background
information about why you did the work. You're going to clearly state
your recommendation and support it with evidence. You're also going to talk about why
you didn't pick the other choice. Because that is a great example of
thinking about your audience and thinking about what they
are likely to ask you. So instead of having that come up
in a Q&A or in an email response, you're going to offer that forward. You're going to think about the action
steps based on those questions that will give people a little bit more nuance
about where you felt confident about your data and where you didn't. And then we're going to go back in and use some preattentive attributes,
which are some design moves that help make some information pop
forward and some information recede. So, some tips before we
go look at a sample. Try not to use slang, try to stay in
formal language whenever possible. So try saying $75,000 instead of 75K. If you're in a company that has
more casual writing standards, feel free to ignore that. You want to explain but
not condescend or talk down to folks. And the best place that I go for
this kind of language is I go look at vox.com's explainers, and
the URL is on your slide. They do a really nice job with this of
being clear and recognizing what novices might want to know but then speaking
to folks in a very respectful way. You are going to have to be clear and concise, which probably means you're
going to have to cut some extra words. I almost always write what I want
to say and then I have to go in and take out words, which might mean you have to
take out some hedging language. So you can't say, I think it appears
to be the case that Frederick County is more advantageous location
if my data is correct. You don't have room for
two lines for that, perhaps. So maybe you say the demographics are
right for us to choose Frederick County or to explore Frederick County. Any time you can add visual variety
to your text is good, bulleted and numbered lists are good. They're easily read and they make your
paper look more visually interesting. We're going to talk more about bad
news as we go through the course but sometimes you're investigating
something that the client doesn't want. And in that case, you should state
it clearly, don't sugarcoat it. Don't put in a lot of like, I know you
were really hoping this would happen, but it didn't. I think it's easiest on
everybody if you're just clear. I have a student who is working on
a client and the client was hopeful, the client was a library and the library
was hopeful that the community would really endorse building a second branch. And she did the interviews and
the interviews said, we'd actually just rather have
the bookmobile come here than go through the expense
of building an entire branch. She didn't build a big emotional
argument about it, she just said, this is something we were looking for,
the response didn't come back as expected. This is the recommendation
I have for moving forward. And finally, you customize
those action steps so they fit the world you found in the data. They help you plug those
holes where the data didn't satisfactorily answer questions or
where data surfaced new questions. So, here we see that all of
those segments are present. We see that the language
is very economical. Although you see, when we prepared this, we made the 75K mistake right there
and apparently right there. You see that, too, we have made even a little call-out
box that emphasizes the key features. So anybody on picking this up is
going to immediately know some of the information that is useful. And we've here talked
about the rejected option. And we talked about preattentive
attributes on the list of things to contribute. And those are places where we
have played with the text or played with the formatting so
that certain things stand out. So we have this use of a list here. We have bolded texts that leap out at us. We have section headers.
We've got a numbered list. And we've got this highlighted
list over here as well that uses a different font styling. And all of these are ways in which
we fit a really economical but useful amount of information
into a really small space. And one of the things you'll notice is
that we don't have any data visualizations at this point. Most of the time with an executive
summary, there's not room for them. We're actually not going to talk about
visualizations until the third week. So this is just a concentration on text. So next up, some tips for
constructing your executive summary.
