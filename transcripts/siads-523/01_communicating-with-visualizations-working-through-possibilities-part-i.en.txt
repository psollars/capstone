Welcome back. What
I want to do in this section is show
you a little bit about how I might work through
some possibilities. So I've mentioned before that when I go to
visualize things, I sometimes need to work through a visualization in a couple of different ways to
figure out what it is I really want to express. And I've just learned
that about myself, that I need a little bit of
time to do that playing, and I hope that you will set that time aside for you
as well because it'll convert what is a pretty
functional task into something that feels more expressive and frankly more fun. And I'm going to advocate here
that we use simple tools. We'll start by looking at
Excel and Google Slides, and then in the final section, we'll look at a free
visualization tool on line that will also automate
a bunch of this for you. So you remember we looked at this is an example of
table data that, remember, it was sorted by
hierarchy because it was sorted in alphabetical
order by state. So as I started thinking through what is it I want to
say about this data, we don't always know right away. Here, what I did was I started by using Excel or
I could use Google Sheets. If you haven't worked with
visualizations in Excel, some of you are Excel wizards and have been doing it for years, and some of you are
running in a corner by the sheer mention
of the word Excel. If you're at a
position where you've got six of one,
half a dozen of another, I would recommend that you
use Google Sheets to do your visualization
exploration because its menus are much more, you get sort of a list of things
that you can play with, whereas you have to go searching
for things in Excel. And I want to be able to do
this to go quickly from data to different
visualization styles, different elements. I might want to swap the axes, I might want to just run through some sample
visualizations to see if a pattern pops up that
I didn't anticipate. And then I'm going
to maybe experiment with how much of the
data I want to show and how many tools
I'm going to want. What I often do then is then
I stick it in PowerPoint and I trace it or I
superimpose axes on it. So let's take a look at
what that would look like. So remember this, we looked
at this a few segments ago, the Wisconsin data standing out. This took me a while to figure
out what I wanted to show, especially because the decline in poverty rates for
the other states, it's not a dramatic decline, and so I had to think about what I wanted
this to look like. So what we're going to do now
is we're going to go over into a Google spreadsheet and walk through how we
made that decision.
