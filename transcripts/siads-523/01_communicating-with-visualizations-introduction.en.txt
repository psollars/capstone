Welcome to Week 3 of Communicating Data
Science Results. This week we're going to dig into visualizations and how
we can use them most effectively in our
technical report to communicate information. This week, we're going to look at why you might include
visualizations in your report. We'll revisit some simple
data presentation formats and what to keep in mind as
we choose those formats. We'll work through
some visualizations and show you some
sample processes. So at this point in the game, you have already determined
your recommendation, you've written your
executive summary, and your report is underway. Now it's time to think about
your data visualizations. And again, I'll just recap that
our goal here is not to be manipulative with the data
or untruthful with the data, but to help readers
and viewers see what's important and significant
about the data. So we might need
to do some work to help our audience
see what we see. We may need to take
out some information, we may need to sort of
smooth out rough edges, and we'll walk through
all of that today. And it means that we're
going to stick to visual communication forms
that novices understand. So I always think as I
approach doing this kind of work, this Florence Nightingale
visualization. And you saw this already in Eytan's course on
data visualization. This was a really
powerful example of inventing a visualization
form from the ground up. But if you presented
this to a busy executive and you had a five-minute window in which to make your case, think about how much
time it would take for you to explain this
visualization to an executive to have
her process that and to still have time to
cover recommendations, action steps, and how
you got to this point. So instead, we're going to focus on these types of designs. You know what, we'll focus
on designs that are more expedient at communicating
that information. So this is some work
that was done online, you can see the citation at
the bottom of your screen, where they took that same Florence
Nightingale visualization, which is trying to show that
if they could cut down on issues of germ spreading when
soldiers had been injured, they could dramatically cut
the death rate in the war. And you can see that this
does a much better job pointing out where
there are big growths in one kind of death or
another and also what the impact is of changing
their health practices. In fact, we could even take this one step
further and we could add this sort of benchmark
line with a note saying, this is when the new
protocol came in. If you'd like, you
can take a look at these other ones as well. All different ways of thinking
about before and after, and how to make that information so simple and so
easy to understand. I will say the one
that I'm a little bit less fond of is the one in the lower right-hand corner
because I feel like it's just missing a label in there. And I think that that
helps us to keep in mind that as we do this
push me and pull you of how do we make this as
simple as possible, we always want to be
thinking about what has to stay so that we continue to
understand what's going on. And you'll see that in
my own examples that we have this week. I also want to point out that depending on where you
get your data from, you will have the option
to download the data, but you may be able to
visualize it on screen or to adapt one that's already been made. Or if it's quite complex, we have a tutorial for
how to use Inkscape, the free graphics download, to trace images and
then tinker with colors right inside the
graphic design software. So whereas you have the option always to work from raw data, sometimes your need for speed is going to mean
that we're going to go to some more basic
tools. And we'll be exploring that in
this lesson as well. Now your textbook
talks about this being a five-step process. Understand context, who
am I presenting for? Why am I doing this? Choosing an appropriate display, what way of
representing this data? Eliminating clutter, things like grid lines or
unnecessary intervals. Drawing attention
where you want it, focusing that attention so
people see in a field of data what it is that's
important to be sure to notice. And finally, thinking like a
designer to spiff it up. And as I was thinking about
organizing this slide deck, I thought I actually do this work a little
bit differently. So I'm going to work from
this flow chart. But I do think understanding purpose and audience is our first step. Then we're going to determine
what matters in the data. And that might be that we go
through an exploratory phase. If we're not sure
where we need to move, then we might need to experiment with some
different formats. We might just want
to play and see how does this look different
in one place than another. We'll actually look at
an example where we get an unexpected finding just by tinkering with the ways in
which the data is laid out. So I try out those
potential displays, and I always know I kind of go
back and forth about that. But my major findings, I want to leave myself
room for those to expand. And then instead of moving
in a linear way, the way the Knaflic
textbook shows you, I find that I sort of go
around this quadrant and get rid of
unnecessary distractors, which she calls clutter. I want to minimize
the cognitive load. I want to do as much
work as I can so that the reader or the viewer is doing the least
amount of work. I want to focus on what matters, draw that attention
just like she does. And then I want to think about the best way to use
aesthetics to add value and to add meaning
to the work I'm creating. So we're going to walk
through this now. First, let's talk about
purpose and audience. So we know this because we are in Week 3 of this course, right? We know that our
purpose is to make a recommendation with action
steps about our scenario, and that our goal from a text perspective is to
flesh out what was in the executive summary and share a much more
robust range of data, with the idea that the
technical report actually is the project in the whole course that has the most information, the most synthesis,
the most discussion. It's the long-form
project in this course. And we're reiterating
that our audience in the case of our
sample scenario is a busy executive who's
a data novice, someone who's smart
but has limited time and lots of other
projects going on. So things need to be packaged, to be simplified, to be clear. But this is a
goodwill supervisor, someone who tends to endorse good ideas if they're
framed really well, and if the supporting evidence and the action
steps are provided. So determining what
matters in the data can be a really
interesting experiment. I mentioned already
that for me this is an iterative kind of process. So you might be asking, when I look at all
this demographic data, what am I really looking for? And here's some things
that I am looking for. I'm looking for things like, do I see any patterns? Or trends would be another way
to talk about that. Do I see any changes, any places where data is increasing or decreasing
significantly? I'm looking to see what could the impact of a phenomena be? What would the impact
be of a recession? What is the impact of a
new road being built? What would be the impact of, in the Florence
Nightingale example, better sanitation
in medical care? I might be looking
for outliers that seem more significant than
they look at first glance. And I also might be looking
at data in relationship. How does this data
about people in my town compare to the data about
people in that other town? How does the financial
bottom line of this organization
compare to that? We've talked before about how communities often
benchmark themselves against each other, so that they can say
that city has kind of got a similar makeup to us
and similar industries, and so we're going to kind of
check ourselves against that community, and relationship
to other data sets. Sometimes we'll realize
that one data set will give us a bit of
demographic information, but if we put it side by
side with another data set, we actually get even
more information. And here's what we often don't need to think
about visualizing. First of all, common knowledge. So I think the go-to example in our demographic data is
we almost never have to visualize the percentage of men and women from
the census data. It's almost always half and half. Now that isn't always the case. So I was looking at the Ann Arbor data
for DemographicsNow, and I think we've talked
about this in Week 1, where there actually
is a spike in where during college years we get significantly more men
in this community, and then that fades
down as people age. So in general though, don't need to do
things that people already know, and in general, we don't need to just tell
the status quo unless it's in relationship to
data that's changing, in which case that
becomes a kind of benchmark. So keep in mind that
it's iterative, keep in mind that you got these terms in the earlier
data visualization course. You might be exploring the data in visual format before you're
ready to explain something, and in the process of making
that explanatory graphic, you might realize you've
learned something else, you go back into an
exploratory phase. So for me, oftentimes, this effective / expressive
partnership is the same way. I often think that this is
what my process look like, there's just sort of all
over as I go back and forth. And I find I really
enjoy that process, and I really like the
sort of detective work that comes out of trying several things with
visualization. And I hope you are the same way. So I'll see you in
the next segment when we continue
our conversation.
