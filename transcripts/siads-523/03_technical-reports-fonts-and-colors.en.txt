Welcome back. We're
continuing to walk through elements of
our technical report. And we're going to talk
quickly about fonts and then move on to
color in this segment. So we've covered content, and here we are, fonts and color are
today's sections. So just to recap, in general, we're in a style of
design that's really emphasizing sans serif fonts
or even a combination of sans serif fonts and this
is particularly true when we're designing
documents that are more likely to be read on screen. Sans serif is a little bit
easier to read that way. Ideally, you're sort of
finding your go-to font that you can use in different stylings to look
a little bit different. Whether it's bold, italic, light, different sizes,
different colors. We're remembering
that font stylings can serve as
pre-attentive attributes. They really help us
focus in on what it is that is important on a page. It's also important
that we think about fonts in terms of hierarchy, and we display that hierarchy consistently across our document. So for example, if our page header is
going to be all caps, then on every page the page header should
be all caps. And if the subheader is the same
font size but title case, that should be
consistent as well. So sometimes, in Word we can actually set up
different styles in advance. That's a little bit trickier to do in presentation software, so sometimes making
a little document that talks about what the default sizes are
and which fonts are used can be helpful to have
next to your computer. Let's move on and
talk about color. And what I want to do to
introduce the idea of color is to think
about brand standards. And this is a document
that often is internal only, that talks about, this is the appropriate
way to use our logo, it needs to be at least this big, this is the actual color
that we use for our brand. Whether or not you
can tile the logo, whether or not you can use
certain fonts with it. And if you are doing a report
for a broader organization, and you're the one that's
either setting the template or working with a graphic
designer to set that template, you need to know what
those brand standards are. And these are usually standards that are set by a graphic design team, either internal or external, whenever there's been
a brand refresh. And it's a document that shows people how those images get used. And I am a Metro Detroit girl, born and raised. When
I grew up in Detroit, you would see people would put bumper stickers on the walls of their garage and overwhelmingly in Metro Detroit, they
would be two things. They would either say WRIF, which was a rock station, or they'd be about
Jegs Auto Parts. So when I saw these
brand standards, I thought these are
the perfect match. In the next segment, what we'll do is we'll look at a series of brand
standards and what we can glean from that when we need to create
our own templates.
