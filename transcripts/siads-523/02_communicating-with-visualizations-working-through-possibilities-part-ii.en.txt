All right, so here we are
in Google Sheets. You can see that we've gotten to the same
visualization style that we had in PowerPoint. I'm going to move this
one out of the way and let's work on constructing
it from scratch. So super easy data set, right? No Python required. You're going to
highlight the cells that you want to visualize, and you're
going to pick this Insert Chart button. And this is why I prefer to start doing my explorations when it's simple
demographic data or report data like this. It's why I prefer to start in Google Sheets because what comes up
is this whole mapping of choices. And so it's really easy for me when I'm
tired and I don't want to work very hard to figure out what it is that
I'm trying to visualize. And so here it defaults
to a line chart and this is interesting in part because what
it shows is the different heights of data. So you can see that although we've really
harped on Wisconsin in the example as being the state without change, the reality is my state of Michigan is the
one that still has the biggest problem. And this chart does a good
job of describing that. But I remembered thinking
that I thought that what I wanted to do was show the trend of
change from point A to point B. And so I kind of thought a slopegraph
felt like a better way to go. So you could walk through this data. You
could pick all of these different styles. We can layer them, we can add shading. We shouldn't make a pie chart,
but look, it lets you. And so this is where you've
got to keep your own sort of, your own compass
of what looks right. I decided I might try to
flip the rows and the columns and by doing that I actually got what
it was that I was looking for. Now, in this case, you can see
how having a lot of colors gives you a sense that maybe the two
blue ones kind of go together and sort of the reddish-shaped ones
maybe go together. And so here we have a lot of colors that are starting to give off
a message that we don't want. Now you could take this
right into PowerPoint and you could just trace over it or
you can go and double-click on lines and decide that you want to gray things out
until all that's left is Wisconsin. So we could do this this way. And then what I would do from here is
I could play with line thickness. So maybe when I get to Wisconsin, which is that one, maybe I want to make
the line thickness a little bit more. And again, I'm not having to
think too hard, right? Because I can always toggle
between these other choices and I like this option a lot. So the other thing that as I think
about doing this is I also am always thinking about legends and
do I need the legends that I have? So in this case, remember what we did in the final
one is we just wiped it out, right? We got rid of this whole section and what we did instead was label
the individual lines instead. Because the other thing that comes
into play here is here again we have the data sorted hierarchically
in alphabetical order, and yet the lines here are not in the order of the legend,
and that can be a little bit confusing. So what I would do next is I
would take this into PowerPoint. I would clean up this header.
I could do it here if I wanted, but I get a little bit more font
choices and I just still think it's easier to work in PowerPoint. And here
I would add my header and my subheader. So as we come back and
look at this visualization, you'll see that we've added the
header, we've added the subheader, We've sorted the states.
Instead of being in a separate column off to the side as a separate
key, which adds visual clutter, we've actually put the states right next
to the data lines which keeps things looking a little bit cleaner. And you can see that we do have
the source of that data right here. And so we know that this is not data
from the "Kristin Corporation," this is data we got from someone else. All right, so that's one example,
and as I mentioned, I do use PowerPoint to go in and
label things or take extra things out or to streamline things as well, only
because that's easiest for me. And you aren't here to
be graphic designers. You're here to be data scientists, hopefully progressing into
being data analysts, and so you want to work as
efficiently as possible. So use the tool that's easiest for you. So you can see that I really like these
Free Press visualizations that were made several years ago. And I keep coming back to them because I
think both that they were great examples for the time in which they were written and I think too that there
are opportunities to streamline things. So here the visualization is trying to
make a couple of significant points. One is that the overall spending
is quite a bit down from before, so there's less money that's
available to be spent. And so you see the overall length of the top graph is much
longer than the second one. And also that they've sorted the types of
spending into various smaller segments. And so here's a case where
to show a lot of detail, we might be losing some
of the big picture. So here's a case where we've got data,
all we need to do is trace it. We don't actually have to go back in and
create a spreadsheet, we could if we wanted. But in this case, I wanted to see
if I could take anything away and really make the point of the smaller
2012 spending really stand out. So here all I did was take some
things away and consolidate things. So here's the after and here's the before. So I've done a couple things. I've changed
some fonts and I've taken away some of the boldness of some of the fonts so
that they recede a little bit. I've combined police and fire into a
single category, so that I can really see, wow, police and fire together
have gone from 17 to 47%. And you might remember in the before,
there was this horizontal dotted line and that actually ended up feeling
a little bit distracting to me. So between the consolidation and
so having less text and also taking out the dotted line, now
I really see the impact that the total spending is just quite
a bit less than it used to be. And I can see that expenses in each
of those categories is going up. So the issue of debt isn't really
the key thing here that has changed for the city of Detroit. It's that there's less money and
it's being spent much more disproportionately on public safety
than it was being spent in 1960. If you're like me,
I set up on my Twitter feed, I like to see things from The Economist. I like to see things from
the Detroit Free Press. I like to see Wall Street Journal
visualizations. I like New York Times visualizations.
And I like the mental exercise and the mental practice of looking
at how someone did it and thinking about how I might
like to do it differently. I think it helps me feel a little
bit more flexible in my thinking when it's my turn to
create the visualization. Now, there may be cases if you
are using existing data, so think about when you were
looking in DemographicsNow. Every now and then you might find
a pie chart and that looks really appealing to replicate,
but the colors are off. What you can do in that case, if you've got a visualization that you
like the general shape of, circles and pie charts don't trace
very well in PowerPoint. So we've got a separate tutorial that
Lauren made for you on how you can use the free Inkscape software, which is
a free open source download on line. And she uses that to insert images and the software will actually
divide that into layers. And once you have the
pie chart in layers, then you can change the colors
accordingly. No code. So this is a hack that works for
those who like graphics, but want a simpler way to go about that. Here is another example, by the way. This is, I think we looked at
this a little bit earlier. This is an Economist one.
You can tell right away. It's got that Economist font,
it's got the branding, it's got the source information.
Gold standard is The Economist. This is a really interesting bit
of data because it's clearly taking someone else's data and it's
trying to tell its own story based on it. So on one hand what we see here is
we used to have a lot of vinyl and a lot of cassettes and then we
went to almost exclusively CDs and then we moved to MP3s and streaming. So here we start with this color coding
that says, all the analog formats are in a shade of red and the digital
formats are in a shade of blue. The challenge is that
this graphic actually has a header that says vinyl
should overtake CDs this year. This becomes harder for us to find because
now we know that the leading actors or players in this visualization,
what's important is not is it analog or digital, which is what the colors
are telling us is important. We're actually going to be
looking at two different analog formats, CD and vinyl. So Lauren did this example and I want to show you how she
worked through it a little bit. So she took the Inkscape method.
She started by thinking, well, what if she made some of
the other analog things purple. So we would have vinyl
would stand out, and then we would have vinyl
compared to cassettes and CDs. So she played with purple for a while. It still wasn't quite telling
the story she was wanting to tell. So she tried a different set of colors and here we're looking at sort of
breaking the whole color scheme and now we're going to try vinyl being yellow
and we're going to have CDs being pink. And now when we look at the
2010, 2015, 2018 data, we see a little bit more
distinction between vinyl and CDs. She still wasn't completely
happy with that. So she said I think what's really
important is this is a visualization about vinyl. So the thing that should really stand
out is the vinyl should be red and then I can turn everything else blue and suddenly the red is the protagonist
of this visualization. And when it comes to
comparing vinyl to CDs, it's actually much easier to do that
than it was in earlier versions. So again, take the time to explore. You
could have remade this with PowerPoint, but really in this case Lauren's
Inkscape tutorial is the way to go. And by the way, The Economist actually had
a version of this graphic that appeared on its Twitter feed, which
is the one on the left. And if you clicked through to the story,
they actually had a different version of this visualization that used
different colors and actually had a different takeaway message, so
you can see the headlines are different. The Twitter one, the one we've been
exploring, was comparing vinyl to CDs. The second one is just saying
hey, formats are changing. So here is where that
addition of text makes a really big difference in helping
people see what you want to see. And as you'll notice as you're
writing your report and in later weeks, in Week 4 you're working on presentations when you've
got limited time and limited space, you really want to use the attention
you have to be very clear and very direct about what you want
people to see in that data. Now I'm going to take you over to the web
to show you another fun way that this got visualized, so I'll meet you over there. So now we're on the
American Enterprise Institute, which is a conservative think tank. They actually got this same data and they visualized it totally differently
in one of these blog posts. And I'm going to click to get it started. What you'll see is that they've actually
animated their bar graphs over time, and this time they're using
horizontal ones. And what you'll watch is that whichever is the dominant medium
is going to change as time goes on. So just think about we're not going to
deal with animations in this course, but think about how fun it would be as your
skills get more advanced to create an animation like this. Let's take a look. You can see that vinyl starts out in
the lead and you see that little tussle between cassette and 8-track take
place, that becomes dominant. Vinyl keeps dropping, keeps dropping.
And you can see how this data is moving. The year countdown that you see
in the bottom right corner, it's going pretty slowly. But the fact that things are moving
as they switch hierarchies is actually kind of mesmerizing, isn't it? And know that if someone
took a screenshot of this, you would know where it came from. You would know where
your source data was and you would also know that it came from
the American Enterprise Institute. So if someone screenshots this, puts this on
their blog, puts it in their social media, it can still be tracked
down to the creator. So hopefully you enjoyed
that variation on a theme. All right, let's head back over
to the slides.
