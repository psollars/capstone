Let's keep going by continuing our
discussion about design considerations. And we're going to revisit some things
you saw earlier in this course and unpack them a little bit further. So remember that as we're working
through this sort of iterative cycle of visualization, we're at the point where we really want to
focus our attention on what matters. It means we want to think about
preattentive attributes that help us highlight what's important, and that might
include color or boxes or font style. So I'll draw your attention back to the
work we did with this table earlier on about how we slowly but surely
stripped back what was important as we converted this from a scholarly article,
where lots of detail takes precedence over readability,
into really simplifying the message so it's much easier for
an audience to understand. And you remember that was working
through several possibilities as we went through it. So keep in mind that what you see here
are things like using colored boxes, adding the title to help us focus, using
a larger more easily read on screen font, things like that. Now you've seen this one
before from Pew Research, and you'll see that they already did some work
with preattentive attributes, right? They've got these horizontal lines that
are separating the data into tiers. They've got those sort of putty-colored columns where they're
notating change over time. And they're actually using bolded text
to say, pay attention to this data. And the one thing we did when we
showed this to you earlier was we decided only to show
the top tier of data. Here we see some other stuff. Now this might be a little hard
to see on your screen, but you'll notice that there's boxed data
at the very end under 2014 data. There's a light box around it to say this
is the one I really want you to look at, and then they've done this sort of version
of exploded data by doing this black word bubble that tells you the exact
percentages for each of the ones, so you don't have to sort of round by
going over and looking at the y axis. Here you see a great use of a
benchmark or comparison line. Here's some data about Flint, Michigan
and the water crisis there. And what they're wanting you to see is
where are the federal standards and where are Flint's results
relative to those standards. And these kinds of benchmarks and
comparisons, this simple line does so much in saying, when did we get to the point
that things started to get in compliance? So thinking about how you can help
people add context to that data, so that just going from 20 to 12 is
a pretty significant jump, but really what we want to know there is that
we're below the federal requirements. Here with FRED data you see that they
automatically focus on adding in these recession lines, so we can see the
points at which there are big fluctuations in data and we instantly can say
oh, but that was a time of a recession. And it gives us some instant
context and some instant clarity. Now you can turn that of in FRED, but you may want to keep it on given
that it adds so much context. Here is a case where to focus on what
matters, these are the historic data about presidential approval ratings for each
president in office since World War II. Here instead of showing the x axis the way
we normally would, we would normally think, well let's use years to
plot that x axis data, here what we see is they replace that
with who is president at the time. Because really what we want to
show here is who is popular and less popular, not necessarily the year. That's not the context
that's important here. So, I hope that as we wrap up this short
segment, this will help you think more about ways in which you can draw
attention and focus attention, and help your client or
your boss realize what's important, which will accelerate the rate at
which they can adopt your suggestions. See you in the next segment.
