As we wrap up this week and
we wrap up this course, I just want to stop for a moment and
give you some final thoughts. First of all, you'll be able to see the final version of
the slide deck we finally settled on that we discussed in the earlier couple
of segments in your course materials. But I want to start here and talk about
some favorite resources that I've relied on over time to help me keep
abreast of what's going on with data visualization. And you'll notice that
all of us at SI have some overlap and we have some different influences. So you'll notice that
hopefully your toolkit's growing as you move through the program. And I want to talk a little bit about who
I've got going in my Twitter feeds that help me stay current. So the number one person, if you're going
to only follow one person on Twitter, I would follow Alberto Cairo, because he
seems to be be a sort of central hub. Lots of people inform him about
what they're doing, and so he's a really great information source. The other person at FlowingData
would be Nathan Yau, whose book we'll talk about
in a couple of slides. Both of them are really good
at aggregating information and being leading thinkers
in how we work through the process of data communication and
data visualization. When it comes to looking for facts or
information or ways in which information is being visualized, I've mentioned
before my fondness for The Economist. And so I really enjoy when they tweet
out some of their visualizations. In fact, you saw the red and yellow one
that we talked about in Week 3. I like to keep the St. Louis Fed
in my Twitter feed because they're the folks behind FRED,
which we looked at in Week 1, and oftentimes they surface a kind of data
that just keeps me abreast of what the broader landscape of existing data
sets are that I can use for things. And finally, USAFacts.
This is a project from former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to try to
contextualize governmental data and draw conclusions for it for
a mainstream audience. I don't always agree with how they
how they go about visualizing things, so oftentimes this is sort of
a mental talkback for me, but I think that skill of critically
looking at visualizations is really important to keep
that mental saw sharp. When it comes to blogs, I still am
a blog reader even as they sort of diminish in favor of
other forms of communication. So I've divided this section
into two columns. First, where do I go to get
great examples and great information about how things
are being processed and visualized? Again, Alberto Cairo is a really great
aggregator of information as well as a leading spokesperson about data
journalism and data communication. FlowingData, again the site of Nathan
Yau, also doing a lot of aggregation work also has some paid tier service that
provides more instruction and tutorials. I do like to look at fivethirtyeight.com
to see the ways in which they're conceptualizing different kinds of data. It can often be a good place to go
to see how they are, for example, looking at how to conceptualize
polling related to the primaries and compare that to other sources. For fun, I like to look at Junk Charts, which often is critiquing poor examples
and talking about how they might be made better. Again, keeping that sort of mental
problem solving going in my head. And the Data Visualization Society. We can argue whether this is a publication
or a blog. They have started a new journal called Nightingale named after
Florence Nightingale, who you've met a few times throughout your time
here in the MADS program. So here we see sort of a more professional organization approach to data
visualization that's really great. And then finally I would be remiss
if I didn't talk about the WTF site, and this is a site that aggregates
really bad examples of visualizations. It's on a Tumblr site, it's not always
updated in any regular time order, but a great place to go if you want to
test your thinking and do sort of a how would I fix this sort of exercise. When it comes to podcasts, amazingly there
are podcasts about data visualization. My favorite is Data Stories. They talk a lot with academics but also
with folks working in industry about how they are dealing with data, how they're
representing it in dashboards, and the two hosts are very genial and
a pleasure to listen to. So for me, when I've got a little
bit of extra time I tune in and it's just a really great insight into
the ways in which different people are approaching the worlds of big
data sets and data visualization. And for general discussions about data and its impact on society, which wasn't
really the focus of our course, I really like the Data and
Society podcast. It again it doesn't have
a regular posting schedule and it tends to be a little bit more academic, but
also is a really great source for people who are curious about the ways
in which the datafication of our world is impacting culture,
underrepresented minorities, and the overall societal
impact of working in data. And I think that's a good
reality check for all of us, especially as your technical
skills get really sharp, how we balance our ability
to manipulate data with how we use data for positive results. And some favorite data communication
titles. Storytelling with Data, which we used as the textbook here. There's also an accompanying workbook
by the same author which helps you work through various kinds of visualizations.
And I'm a big fan of Data Story, which is where we got the information
about using slidedocs. It's a really great primer in how
you communicate to audiences and ways in which you might
deploy different tools. For visualization-specific books, I recommend Cairo's September
2019 release of How Charts Lie, which I think is the sort of 21st century
version of How to Lie with Statistics, which I think is also a great primer. It's an easy read, it's written for
a mainstream audience. And I'm also a fan of
Nathan Yau's Data Points, which is a great book that
walks through visualization for both communication, but
also data visualization as an art form. He has another book called Flowing Data
that has a much more technical approach to data visualization. I like Data Points as a way of
thinking really about the art of data. When it comes to data journalism and
going to find examples of things that I find appealing,
I like the New York Times. As you've noticed, I've used a couple of
interactives from them in this course. I do like bloomberg.com. I think they're
really clean and sharp. Again, you know I'm an Economist fan and the Wall Street
Journal also does a great job and there is some classic texts on data visualization
from the Wall Street Journal as well. I also want to remind you that U of M library does have subscriptions
to all of these publications so you can follow them on Twitter or you can
have them be in your blog aggregator and then you can look it up in the library's
website to find the contemporary thing. The other thing that you might want
to play with out of MLibrary is socialexplorer.com, which visualizes
census data, both current and historical, and lets you do things
like side-by-side comparison, so you can compare racial demographics
from pre-Civil War to post-Civil War, for example. And it's always worth poking
around because that is one of the largest libraries in the world and your
tuition covers all of those resources. So with that being said,
you've got some work to do. I can't wait to see what you come up with. And when your questions arise,
we'll see you on the Slack channel or in office hours. Thanks for being a part of this
course and good luck.
