Welcome back. We want to
talk now about personas. And for those of you who have a
user experience background, that may be a term
you know already. A lot of times in the
world of Silicon Valley, people construct these
kind of imaginary groups of people that might
use a product. And what we know is that
DemographicsNow will actually deliver those
personas for you pre-packaged. They look at all the
underlying demographics, they run a magical formula, and they point you
in the direction of some pre-made descriptions. And they're pretty amazing. And I think that at the end of
this you're going to have a really good sense of where you're going to go
with your project. So I already ran the report. And by the way, if your screen
looks different from mine, we've just blown it up a little bit so it's bigger
on screen for you. And that took what usually
these are right next to each other, it just stacked them up and down. So we're going to go down
and you're going to see this list of kind of funny
names of groups. And UX personas are often
named after people. And these do have names
when we get inside, but these are on the surface level
described by who they are. And Group A is sort of the
top 10 percent in the US. And it tells us that 13 percent of the community fits that profile. And as you see we can scroll down and there's a whole cluster
about families. So you see that
there's the header, there's the group B cluster, and under it these families. You can see that
nobody fits B7, B8, or B10, there's only
people in this population. And we see this Aging of Aquarius really sort of pops out and
stands for something. You can see there's
all different ways of aging in America. So as you continue down, every persona has a
positive-sounding name, even if their economic
situation is not amazing. So I'm going to scroll
back up and let's take a look at what Aging
of Aquarius is about. And what you'll do is you'll get connected to these
four-page documents. And you can see that Mosaic
comes from Experian. Yes, they are the people that
do the credit monitoring. So they are keeping track of what we're spending our money on. Actually, zoom that
out one more, there. Now it all fits on the screen. You can see a handful of information just on
this first page. So you see this over here
in the far left column. You see that some key
features about them. We see highly educated,
upscale housing, college sports, interested
in philanthropy, investing. And we see up here that this
group is summarized as the upscale boomer-aged couples living in city and
close-in suburbs. And if you were to need it, you could call them
Gary and Donna. There's a little summary
here of demographics. Now, I want to be clear that
these are national personas. So this data is not 100 percent pinpointed
to Kendall County. So when it comes to things like estimated household income, you're still going
to do better to look at the census data or
to look elsewhere. This is showing you
a national profile. So imagine that what you do for a living is you sell soap, and you have soap for aging skin and you have soap for baby skin, and you have soap for all age groups. And you want to know how many
people in the country might fit this profile of 50 years and up, and this income profile. Is there a big enough
market for that? So this document can be used
in its entirety for that. But that's why when we're
looking at Kendall County only, we have to be a
little bit fuzzier on the specifics and more look
at the narrative stuff. Now I do want to
draw your attention to two things over here. These are also indices. We looked at indices
a few minutes ago. And again, so if 100 is
the average American, how do they like to
get information? So they are less likely than the average American to
like to get things by mail. They certainly don't
get things by text. And they are much less likely to get things online or by email. How they get their information overwhelmingly, way more than the national average, is
from watching television, or the next highest number
is listening to the radio. So if you were doing some kind
of marketing or corporate work, this would really help
you pinpoint where your ads are going
so you don't set up a whole texting system
and then wonder why nobody looks at it. There's also an estimate
about technology adoption. And that could be
helpful if you are in a high-tech business
or if you work in schools or libraries where you might need to meet
people where they are. We're going to skip this page, and that's because this is average national data
about this group. And that actually isn't going
to help us very much here. The one thing I will point
out from the header is that 2.46 percent of households in
the United States fit this, and 3.27 percent of humans in
the United States fit this. So this is a pretty small group. So you might now want
to make a lot of soap just aimed at
Aging of Aquarius. There's some explanation of what happens in the documents but
they save the best for last. And what shows up on this last page, and let me zoom that in
for you a little bit, is this entire page that
describes the people here. And you can sort of
rank these then by the percentages that
show up and it will help you understand who the possible consumers
would be in a community. This is a nice Baby Boom group. Lots of them have no
children at home, even though some of them are
still of non-retirement age. They tend to be better
educated with higher income. They tend to live in
established neighborhoods, so that could be a red
flag for us if we know that a lot of Chicken
Kitchen locations are in areas of
newer development. And a lot of them have
not moved in a long time. They like to do things like exercise and fitness and sports. They have a nightlife. They go to plays, but they
also have an artistic life. They like brick
and mortar stores. They like everything from high-end retailers
to discount clubs. And they buy in lots of ways. So we're starting to
see some things like, oh, you know people
like this perhaps, that shop both at Nordstrom
and at Discount Club, that have got a little
extra disposable income, and their house is getting
close to being paid off. They are also health conscious. And they snack on healthy
foods and they avoid the fast food
their kids grew up on, which doesn't say the
fast food available now. So you'd want to
be really careful if this is the target
audience you're looking for. Is this a population that likes fast food at all, or are they just
avoiding McDonald's? We're not quite sure. But you remember that
the profile said that Chicken Kitchen does
better in conservative areas, and here that bears it out. Now ideally, you'll also go look for county election results
in your research, but this is pointing kind of
in the right direction. There's just that one red
flag about fast food. They're creditworthy and they pay by credit a lot of times. So we would have to
in this community know that credit card
fees would be a cost we'd need to absorb or build into our pricing system because it looks like if this
population came, that would be how
they paid for things. So what we can get from these personas is
these really well thought out
multi-dimensional views of people in the community. And when you look at the top
three or four markets in a metropolitan
area, or in our case, in a county, you can
really get a sense of is this the type of person that this would be
a good match for. So let me go back for
just a moment and let's go down this
list a little bit. Let's look at the economic
challenges group, just so you can get a sense. You'll notice there's
nobody in this group apparently living in this county, which bodes well if you want
them to be your choice. So this is Tough Times. Let's zoom them in. This is Carl and Wanda. They are a very small
percentage of the US population. But they're super-attuned
not to TV and radio, they're super-influenced
by the Web, by text, by email, and by getting
stuff in the mail. Here we see that this
is a city profile. Renters, same age
as Age of Aquarius. They tend to live in
multifamily units, one person per household, renting, and maybe
less than $15,000. So these might be
minimum income folks, but boy, are they
good at technology. Isn't that a surprise? Again, we're going
to skip the second and the third pages. Oh, that does not look like
a happy lifestyle. These are the most
economically challenged. If they're still working, they earn minimum wage
and very low incomes. Now again, when I see a dollar figure like this
in a Mosaic profile, I have to know that
that's a number that's across the national
description of this group. I would never pull this from
a report and stick it in my work because I know that the local data will be
more specific about that, the census data will be better. Mostly cities east
of the Mississippi, buildings are aging, but
they like city amenities. They go out locally, but don't build a
sports equipment store in their neighborhood. We know something about
where they might shop. Now, if you have this
population in your community, there might not
literally be a Kmart, or there might not
literally be a Family Dollar, but those would be the types
of places they might shop. And they settle for what
they can afford. They don't have cars. So that's why they are attributed as not
listening to the radio. So you can see how there's an enormous difference
between how each of the profiles
is constructed. So you'll want to go through the profiles for each of your
counties or cities, and for each I usually think about the big three in each that
I'm going to look at. You want to keep track
of the proportion of population that
fits each of these. But it's a really good way to say how many of
these populations, now that we can get
even more granular, do we think are possible
customers for us? We can start to
extrapolate that data. So as we go back over
to the slide deck, what I hope you're feeling now is that you're moving more
into this formulation stage. That you are starting
to get some clarity as you look across all of that data, the census data, the estimates, the predictions, the consumer data, the personas, you're
starting to get a sense of who those folks are. And hopefully, we're
getting us nudging a little bit closer to
the sense of clarity. You might want to stop here
and explore on your own since DemographicsNow
is such a rich tool, and then come back
and start the videos. In the next video, though, when you're ready to go on,
we're going to look at who's Fred, and why do
we care about his data? And I'll see you there
in the next segment.
