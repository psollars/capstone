All right. Now, let's take another look through
this slide deck, and talk about what worked and what maybe was
less effective. So we'll start. Here's
the title slide. This is actually the logo
for Chicken Kitchen. And this does a couple of things. First, we have the option of
pursuing this color theme, or coming up with a sort of
complimentary color theme. You can see we chose
to use the branded theme. And we'll take a look
at times when that really works and times when
maybe it didn't work so well. But because this logo had a font, we were able to copy the font. This is Montserrat, and you can see that it's got a couple
of different weights. There's the chunkier
bold font in the logo, and then superimposed is
that lighter font style. This is a stock photo based on the Experian Mosaic profiles that we looked at
way back in Week 1. We found an open
source variation for the purpose of these slides. But beginning the slide
deck with people, especially happy smiling people, can be a way of really
humanizing an experience. So I do like this moment. Did we need two moments? I'm not quite so sure. One might have been enough. The thing you want to be
careful about whenever you are making sort of these photo
representations of folks is that you've got at
least some diversity that's reflective of the community
that you were talking about. Here, I think that one of the
things that felt important for context is why
were we looking at two very different
populations. So in this case, I built them out to
be natural extensions of where we already
have locations. This might not work
in every case. But I put a dotted
line to show that they didn't yet exist there. And here you see where
really sticking with the brand colors is
potentially overwhelming. So if Chicken Kitchen
is the kind of place where everything
is pink all the time, then this is going
to fit right in, right? If it's a place where
that logo was meant to be a provocative contrast, then you can see how this could easily become overwhelming. And we can fix this in
a couple of ways. One is we could switch to that darker border
color of the logo, one is we could ignore it
altogether and look across the color wheel and find a different color that
is complimentary to it. And this image, by the way,
is just a Wikipedia US map, so I was able to put a colored
background behind it. So another option could
have been that I didn't put a pink background but I left the pink dots because pink
dots represent the company. Here, again I wanted to make the point that this is
a great place to be. So even though a lot
of the narrative is about highways and
commuting time, I wanted to really
build up this sense and give the impression
that this is one of those higher income communities where this franchise fits well. So I wanted to sort of awaken
this sense that this was the right kind of community for the profile that this
corporation has set forward. Here, I think we
have a design mistake. And you can think, "Gosh, it's
really great that we have like these maps and that's kind of cool
to have the state outlines." But part of what makes us
problematic, of course, is that Texas is really
geographically enormous, yet it has the smaller income. So in order to make Maryland look big enough to
have 95K in income, we've completely
skewed the graphics. We tried graying out the Texas so that the
Maryland one comes out, but here's a place where
it's just not adding up. And maybe, a simple graph, a bar graph, would tell the
story more effectively, or frankly, just doing a numbers-only graphic with just
the 95 and the 81. And maybe 95 is a dark color
and 81 is sort of grayed out. So here's a place where
I think we had a bit of a ambitious design
experiment that's a fail. I always wrestle with these two-year or side-by-side
graphics like this. And I think that this makes the case. I think that maybe less
data, or different data, or maybe even a
table of data with colored boxes might have been slightly easier to
understand right away. Or what I might do here is
make a pie chart where I show that the wealthier
population, the 100K, is growing. And then I might cluster some
of the lower-income data and show that that population is shrinking or staying stable. That might have done a
better job and required a little bit less
technological intervention. Here's another place where the attempt was to be
graphically interesting. And it turns out that there was
a lot to say about roads, right? So in a way, this
works pretty well. It very boldly says, this is what is important. I think what's a little
bit less effective here is the two different
colors of pink, with Frederick
County being bolder, Kendall County being sort of
transparent and grayed out. So here I think you
either want to take the metaphor all the way. If you want to visualize that, maybe it's two cars
on the road or it's two exit signs on the road, but I feel like the pink
boxes are not quite the right metaphor to go
with the bold graphic move. And I should point out that
this road comes from the site The Noun Project
which is a great place to get free to use with
citation graphics of all kind. They're all black and white, you can recolor them, but it's sort of my go-to place
when I need something graphical and I'm not
going to make it myself. Here, we switched to maps. And I think that maps can
be super powerful here. Now, the question
that arises when you see this map, first of all, it's very clear that there are these major roads
that go all around, right? And I think what maybe would have
been stronger here is not to have the little Yelp
numbers in place yet but merely to say, there's a lot of
expressways here. Because the case about number of restaurants can be made
better on this slide, right? Here, we've got some
screenshots from Yelp and we see the location. And this is a good place
to pause and talk about how one could make an argument that
this is the wrong place, which is why there's
a bit of ambiguity involved in all of
your scenarios. We could say this area
is already too built up. I show you one Chick-fil-A
in this picture, there are actually two. So bringing in a new
chicken company, that might be
too much restauranting in a single lane of interest. So you would not want to say, absolutely, we're going
to put down roots here. You might want to think
about site visits, and pricing out the market, and being a little
bit more measured. You could also say
the opportunity is in Kendall County, which
is less developed. We could really plant our flag. We could get land for less money. We could be the
dominant price point. And that would also be a different
approach to the argument, right? If these decisions were all
hit 'em out of the park, we wouldn't need to
hire an analyst, right? I do like the simplicity of this slide that just says
there is a college there. I could have done a
photo, but I think that would have added
a sense that I'm supposed to get something more out of the image than
really is intended. So I'm just minimizing the cognitive load and
just putting the logo up. I've made this point, and we've been talking
about this since Week 1, of anticipating what an audience might ask in a presentation. And so throughout this course, there's been the
recommendation that you think about why not the other choice? And here we represent
that as a table. You could also have a
really high-power image. Let's say that you know that Chicken Kitchen's
profits are directly, they travel in an exact same
pattern as the percentage of the population that
votes Republican, or that has the highest
anticipated growth. You might highlight
just that one fact. What I wanted to
show here is that we knew multiple measures
of impact that lead toward the probability
of more profits per store, and that made Frederick
the key picture. But here again, we see
that bright, bright pink color. This is going to appeal to
some of your cultures and not. Again, we're trying to echo
the Chicken Kitchen logo. We could easily debate
whether that should have been a different
color or whether we should have applied a
transparent version of that color so that we got the same intensity but a little bit
more white mixed in. And again, you'll want to sit
and play with these sorts of things. We could also have, for example, taken out the vertical lines. That's one of my go-tos
when I look for tables. Because we don't
have a ton of data, we would probably not lose
any meaning if we did that. And again, you find that out
by your experimentation. You'll also notice, by the way, that the fonts on this
table might look bigger than they did when
you were working on your technical report. And again, that's because
we anticipate that most technical reports are
written on bigger screens, but when we're here in the
webinar moment of things, those fonts might need to be a little larger because there's a much higher probability it will be seen on a small screen. Now finally, we returned to those same images from
before as our closing, keeping in mind that people
becomes then the major theme. Now, let's say I have
a CEO that isn't into pink and isn't into people
and is all about profits, would I organize
this differently? I sure would. But I'm assuming
in building this out that this is a group that is pretty people-centered
and that people are going to be responsive
to that kind of mode. And that's about all the time
you're going to have. You're going to have five minutes so you're
going to have to be really judicious in
making your recording. That means you'll have
to decide on what is my highest impact argument? What are the tools I have in my tool kit to
deliver that impact? How am I going to practice
to be ready for that? So you'll want to think about
five minutes looks short, but there's all that
prep work around it. And try to give yourself
the space to enjoy that process because
you're going to learn so much through that
experimentation. All right, that's
it for Week 4. Good luck in your own webinar.
