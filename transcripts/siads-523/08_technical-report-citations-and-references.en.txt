Welcome back. I've saved the picky picky for last, and that's discussion
of citations and references. So this slide deck isn't quite a formal
academic paper, but it still is important that there's never any question
of where your information came from. So that's why we want to talk
about citations and references and what they might look like in
this unique style of document. So first, let's talk a little
bit about why citations matter. And I should probably back up a step and
say what is a citation. And a citation is just a note placed
in various places on the text, depending on what format you use,
that says hey, I didn't make this information up,
I got it from the source. So especially as a young or
new professional in data science, it's a way of building up your credibility
and your authority right away, to show that these aren't just your ideas,
when they build on the ideas of others. And that idea we sort of nickname standing
on the shoulders of giants, that you are building on work that has happened
before and you're acknowledging that work. We all come from different
disciplines here at SI, and each of us is used to
a different form of citation. So some of the common ones are APA, for American Psychological Association, MLA,
Modern Language Association, Harvard. In my neck of the woods we tend
to use Chicago Author-Date. And we need to make those acknowledgements
that we're using information we got from elsewhere in two places. First, in the report proper,
we need to note that. And we can do that by mentioning the
source in the sentence in which we talk about the data from there. We can do it in an endnote, which means that we put the source
in parentheses with the date. And we can also do it as a footnote. So we'll also post a link to where
there's a more comprehensive discussion of each of these formats
if this work is entirely new to you. At the end, we also list all of the
references over again so that we can see it both as we're reading the report and
we can see it once the report is complete. So let's take a look at what this
might look like in a slide doc. So there's sort of three ways that
you might show where your information came from. And one is the top version on your screen,
and that is where we just
mention where it came from. So maybe we say according
to the 2010 census, 25% of the population lives
below the poverty line. Because this isn't
a formal academic paper, that is an acceptable means of citation. Another way to approach that would be
to say to give the factual information, in this case, the median
household size is 2.4 residents, and then put the source of the data and
the year. And this is the Chicago Author-Date style. There are other ways that do this. MLA, I believe you can drop the year off. The third option is that
you can put a footnote, and that's by making the little
superscript after each fact. And then, at the bottom of each page,
you provide the citation information. So here's some things I
think we want to avoid, and one is cluttering up our
document that we have worked so carefully to streamline, and
minimize the visual clutter. We don't want to stick
an active hyperlink in there, unless that is the in-house
style of your organization. Because what it's going to do is it's
going to introduce a new type of font styling to your report,
and it's going to stand out and often disrupt the color scheme that
you've worked so carefully to choose. So we never want to use
a citation that is just a URL. But what we could do is say according
to the 2018 American Community Survey via CensusReporter dot org,
the population is that. In the second way of doing things,
it's much easier for us to see where the information came from. Now, a common mistake that people make
is that if they use CensusReporter, they don't mention the age or they act
like CensusReporter is the data source. And if you're using CensusReporter,
you don't want to say it's the source, you want to say that it was
where you found the data, but that the actual data source is going to
be whatever's at the top of the page. And one of the things that we've
learned from doing lots of work with CensusReporter over time is that the data
source at the top of the page might be different depending on what
community you're looking at. So CensusReporter should never be
listed as the source of the data when, really, it comes from some
version of the census. Now, you're going to also need
a bibliography or a works cited or references page at the end of your report. And again, different disciplines
handle this differently. And some of you come from a background
where just making a list of the names of places you found things,
or it's just a list of URLs, it looks something like the one
on the left, is what happens. And here's where you're
really going to need to put that little bit of extra effort in and put it in a recognizable citation style
like we talked about a few slides ago. So APA, MLA, Harvard,
Chicago Date, styles like that. So we want to little bit more
formality on that references page. And whether it's called references or
bibliography or works cited will depend on
what citation format you use. So we're not picky about
which format that is, but we do want to see that extended entry. Now, making citations can be a real pain,
and that's why I want to recommend
that in my experience the best way to format citations is to use the free
tools page at noodletools dot com. Some of you used this tool when you were
in high school to prepare citations. You maybe even had an account when you
logged in, and that account is fantastic. It'll let you store all of your notes and it will let you save up all your sources
and it will auto-generate your whole page. I think it's about $10, but you can also
do one entry at a time on their free page. And just recently, I was working with
a middle school student, and she had been sent home and told use EasyBib to
to create your list of citations. And she used some data sources
that were kind of odd, and she really struggled with EasyBib. But noodletools has lots of prompts,
and I was stunned that after doing one sample with noodletools she felt
comfortable doing the rest on her own. Now, I'm not saying
you're in middle school, I'm just saying that if making citations
is something you struggle with, in my experience, this is the best
way to get over that struggle. It will say is this a data set,
an image, a website, a book, an article? And it will walk you through what
information you need to provide, and then you can copy and paste that
information into your slide deck. So I hope that that will clarify
a little bit about citations and references, both why we do it and the various techniques that
you can use to generate them. So with that,
that brings us to the end of week two. Some of you may want to move ahead and
start into week three. And so, your schedule might get
a little off during this time. This is a shorter set of lectures
than the week three ones are. Some of you like to create your visuals
at the same time you're creating your content, in which case you'll want to
watch the videos a little bit earlier. And some of you may want to just
settle in and do some research. Just keep in mind that time is your
best tool with this project, and that if you can kind of
time box your schedule and say I'm going to set this time aside,
and I'm just going to sink in and do the work for a while, I think you're
going to find a lot more satisfaction. And you're going to find that as you
move through that continuum that we talked about in week one, that
you're feeling like you're getting out of the struggle part and into
the successful phase as soon as possible. Again, we'll be in office
hours when you have questions. See you there.
