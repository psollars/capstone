Hi. Welcome to Week 2
of our course. This week we're going
to focus on expanding that research work and the report writing you started with the executive summary last week, and expanding into a
longer technical report. And we're going to focus
on using slidedocs as the format for those
technical reports, which I hope you'll
find a fun and refreshing change from past
papers you've written. So let's get started. So this week we're
going to talk about what a technical report
is trying to accomplish, why we're taking the
slidedoc approach, and then we are going
to walk through four key areas: content, fonts, color, and layout. Then we'll talk about
the nuts and bolts of the elements of the
report you need to have, and citing your sources. So let's start by talking about the goals of a technical report. Because if you come from a humanities
background like I do, you are probably really used to crafting scholarly papers that have very well-crafted
introductions and transitions between ideas, and a technical report is actually much
different from that. Key here with a technical report, our goal is to communicate
as clearly, as concisely, and in as predictable a
structure as possible so that things are prepared
for the busy professional, and that means we spend less time on what we strove to learn
for years about craft, and it's more about
communication. And that means that we're going
to use a lot more headers, we're going to use a lot
more formatting devices like bullet points and section headers and
preattentive attributes. It means that we're going to be really clear about what we want people to take away from the data that
we've generated. And so let's take a look. We're going to try this
format called slidedocs, and this is a project
that comes out of Nancy Duarte and the Duarte firm, which is an approach that uses slide presentation software. You might use PowerPoint,
you might use Keynote, you might use the Google product, and it uses that as our tool. And there are several reasons for why this might be a way to go, as opposed to Microsoft Word. First of all, it means
that we can create a series of templates
with a series of formats, and you can plug in
which formats work most easily for you so that we create something that's
visually appealing, and yet, once you
get those templates, is easily reused and re-imagined. We also use it because
we're going to have a combination of text
and visual components, and it's quite quick to rearrange those elements in any kind
of slide deck software. Next, the reality is
that in many cases, we're still creating
portrait documents, documents that are
taller than longer, but we're reading them on
screens that are landscape, that are wider than taller. And that means we've got a
mismatch, traditionally, between our traditional
format writing and the ways in which
people view them. So by using a slidedoc software, we're able to present
our information in the shape that the screens
it's being read on are done. But, as you might guess, any project that takes on some layout attributes
is going to take extra time and extra planning. And making something
fit a template can mean that we come up
with a piece of writing, we stick it in the document, and we have to still do some
edits to make things fit, and that's a real challenge. Now, what you've read
in the Duarte reading was about how slidedocs also help us communicate in a way that's a little bit more
for a general audience, and also lacks, perhaps, some of the in-depth deep dives of a full
word processing document. So we're straddling here between depth of content
and ease of readability. And you may find, again, if you have a strong
writing background, that this is something
that's going to take you a little bit longer
to work through. But I always find that if I can set aside the time and
settle into doing it, it's really fun, and it really refreshes the way I normally
think about a writing project. So let's think about what you saw in that Duarte slide deck, which was pretty
enormous, wasn't it? As I sort of thought about
the big picture of what she was trying
to communicate, and this is also expanded
on in her book Data Story, it's four different categories. And one is the
question of layout, which is, how do things look on the page, the digital page? What templates do we use? How do we use white
space? Things like that. She spends time
talking about fonts, and we've talked about
that already in Week 1, so we won't spend as
much time on that here. She talks about color and about
branding and consistency, and she talks about content. Who we're writing for, why we're writing, the
words we use to write. And we'll talk about
arguments and evidence, which she has some
different language in Data Story she uses for that, and things like citations
that bolster our arguments. So we're going to
start by talking about content because obviously, this is the most important
part of any report. And what you'll notice is that we've provided you with a series of templates that you can
choose to adopt so that, really, your focus can
be on the content. And so the first question
we want to ask, and we talked about
this last week, is this question of audience. Who am I talking to? Is it an internal audience or an external audience? That may change the perspective
or the spin, or even the ways in which
we communicate information. What is their level
of data expertise? How much can I assume that
if I put a stacked bar chart in, can I assume that they'll understand that format already? We'll talk about this
throughout the course, that question of really wanting
to use the simplest forms possible unless we know our
audience is full of experts. And that's part of why
this course focuses on demographic data that is
much easier to visualize. We also want to think about how do they like to
receive information? And this is particularly
important when our audience is a busy executive. How do I respect
their limited time? And that may mean that we are
reducing their cognitive load. We aren't just going to put out information and let them
draw their own conclusion, we're going to go and
say, "We think this is what we should do. Do you agree?" And we're going to think
about what's our purpose? Why are we sharing
this information? Is there a sense of time urgency? Is there a crisis looming? Are we running out of money? Do we need to rethink some
of how we do business? And what do we want
people to do with it? And that's why back in the
executive summary, we were already talking
about those action steps. And then we think about how do
we ethically convince them? So when you do this research, you're going to be exposed
to a lot of potential data. And one of the things that will make this project a challenge is that we can't necessarily
say on slide 3, do this, on slide 4, do this, because all of you will be encountering
different data, some of which will be more
convincing than others. So you'll have to pick and choose how much data that you can, that fits, that is relevant, and that is valuable. But what we should not do is cherry-pick minor data
or outlying data and use that to make our full argument. We want to think about the
ethics of communication. I think there are
plenty of stories in current events about data that's being used
in a non-ethical way, or that's being leveraged
to convince people to take an action that logic would
say is not supported, and that's one of
your responsibilities as a data scientist here at U of M. Purpose also can have
to do with context, and this kind of comes to
that question of why are we talking
about this data? So this is Duarte's Data Story. It came out in Fall of 2019. Highly recommended,
as you've heard. And she talks about
that there can be three potential contexts for why you might do a
report like this. One is you're reacting to something that's
changed in the data. So maybe you've been
monitoring dashboards in a corporate setting and you see that something is
changing in the data. Something is moving
in a direction, and either you need to seize on an opportunity or it's time to do some reparative
work, in which case you are expressing this
data so that people will take action
one way or another. One is that you might be
being proactive. You see a trend starting. It's not a crisis step yet, but you want people
to be aware of it so that there's time and there's available energy and resources to be prepared
for taking action. And one is you might be
making a prediction. You see some patterns that hint that something in
the future might be taking place and
you think you can predict the future based
on past behaviors. And throughout your exploration
of demographics now, you definitely see this year's estimates and
you see five-year projections. That is making a
predictive decision. And by the way, if I go back
to this for just a second, be thinking as well of the
fact that your response to this prompt for this course could take different approaches. So in looking at the two counties we used as
a sample in this course, we talked about
Kendall County and we talked about Frederick County. One of those, if you decide
to choose Kendall County, you're actually doing a much more predictive approach because there is the prediction
that there will be growth in the future and
it will be large growth, and that investing
now means getting in on the ground floor of
that predictive growth. You want to also
think about voice. And in general, our goal here in this setting is to
be professional, to have the appearance of
at least of objectivity, to be matter of fact. Given the space constraints
involved in slidedocs, we want to be efficient
in the way that we speak. And so I would again
refer you back to those Vox explainers as a
really good voice to practice. And when I say all of this, I mean things like we don't need to use hyperbolic language. We often don't need to say, like, "The world's best opportunity
lies ahead in Washtenaw County," or "There
is no other choice but to consider choice B." It means that even as we're expressing how we
want to move forward, we're not using language
that sounds disingenuous. And you'll find that
this efficient voice is going to really
help you as you juggle the constraints
of space versus content. Now I want to talk a little bit about arguments and evidence. So we're seeing a real shift in how Americans in
particular are writing. And we often see that people
will dump a bunch of facts without setting
the broader context, without thinking about why
are those facts there, what are they meant
to communicate, and what do we want
people to do with them? And I want to surface this in
part because many of us are used to when we use slide deck software
for presentation, we sort of just dump some facts
about households on this slide and then we go to another
slide and that one's about salaries and income and we
dump some information there. And we just kind of create this
episodic slide deck where every slide covers
something different, and we don't take that extra step to sort of
package it all up and say, "This is what the data tells us. Here is the data. This is what I think we
need to do with it." So I really want to encourage you to think about how you craft these pages so that you're not just doing a data
dump on each page. You're really thinking
about how am I guiding people to make the decision that is the most important to me. So as you can see
on the slide here, we're thinking about what are
the most salient arguments? What is the data that's the most important and why
is it the priority? When I come to a conclusion, what data backs that argument up? How do I go beyond just
doing that data dump? And this requires a certain amount of craft and thoughtfulness, and it's why I'm
going to suggest that you want to slow down between finding information and
creating your report, that there be a little bit of processing time
built in there. So what I think is really
helpful for this is really to think about
this four-step approach. One is you do the research and you find what
is the evidence, what are the facts telling me, what is the data telling me. And from that, I'm going to
draw some conclusions. I'm going to determine
what are the big points that I need to make that
support the decision that I'm going to
deliver in my report. Third, I'm going to
think about outlining. What's the best way of
communicating this? What information is
critical and not critical? And finally, then I go to
writing and creating. So I'm not just
finding and dumping, I'm really doing
that process work. And that's why I'm
going to recommend that while outlining feels old school and it feels
like it's out of date, I think that it
can really help us to do that mental processing. So in the next segment, I'm going to walk through
an example of what that might look like.
I'll see you there.
