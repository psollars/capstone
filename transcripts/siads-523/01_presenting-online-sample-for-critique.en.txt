Hi, there. Now, what I'd like to do is
show you a sample presentation. Some elements are elements you might want
to emulate in your own presentation and others maybe not so much. So I'll give the presentation and
then I'll come back through and walk through what I think goes well and
not so well. So here we go. Good afternoon. Welcome to our market analysis for
Chicken Kitchen. Meet the Smith family. They're a two-income household living
in Frederick County, Maryland. They both work. They have two cars. They're on the go a lot. And
when it comes time to feeding their son, they wish they could eat at home more
but they don't have the time. This is the perfect customer for Chicken Kitchen, as we know
from our other locations. They have money, easy transportation, and
an interest in feeding their children food that's a little bit above what
they were fed as fast food growing up. And here meet the Jones couple. They're now empty nesters and they're
finding that their desire to spend hours in the kitchen has really been diminished
when it's only the two of them eating. So they too are looking for
a quick meal but a meal that meets the nutrition
standards they're used to. We think these are the right kind
of people for a Chicken Kitchen and you asked us to go out and look for which county might be a better starting
point for the expansion of our franchise. Should we go further into Texas
with Kendall County or should we continue the East Coast migration by
looking at Frederick County, Maryland? In our analysis, we believe
Frederick County is the right place to continue our site search and we've made
that suggestion for a couple of reasons. First of all, there's simply
more money in Frederick County. The median household income
is quite a bit higher in Frederick County than
it is in Kendall County. We noticed something
interesting when we looked at Frederick County's population as well. We looked at the 2019 income brackets, and
the estimate for 2024. And what we see is that while there's a minority population
that's low income in that community, and that is not our target
Chicken Kitchen audience, what we see is a growth in those
higher-income communities that have more disposable income, that are willing
to pay a little bit more for food that's both fresh and healthy. We also looked at commuting time and
here the comparison between the two counties wasn't quite as acute as
some of our other factors, but we do see that the Frederick County
commute is quite a bit longer and as the suburbs of Washington DC
continue to migrate westward, Frederick County is continuing its
hot spot as a place for DC commuters. And commuters in their car mean two
things. One, they're looking for drive-throughs, and two,
they're tired of being in the car. So we know that long commute time
maps really well to profit margins. We also noticed that Frederick County
has a couple of interstates and a major state highway. This means there's a lot of coming
and going in this community, and that means there's going to
be money from out of town coming in to shop at
Frederick destinations. And finally, when we looked at
who's already in Frederick, we see lots of our peer
organizations and companies. Companies that are one step
up from Burger King and McDonald's and are more in our
price bracket and our space. And you can see from the screen who
some of those competitors might be. Also Frederick county is
the home of Hood College. We also know that communities with college
populations do get higher profits than those without. It also helps us nurture a new
round of customers moving forward. But you might be asking why didn't
we choose Kendall County, Texas? Well, we ran a bunch of numbers and when
we looked at where Frederick excelled and where Kendall County excelled, we see that both have the potential
to be good candidates, but Frederick's got a little more time in
the car, a much higher starter population, higher median income, and already
a presence of mid brands like ours. I will point out that Kendall County's
population is set to grow at a faster rate than Frederick, and it is possible
that if we wanted to start a low sort of, a slow boil, that Kendall County might
be the place to grow slowly over time. But if we want to hit the ground
running with profits right away, we're going to go with Frederick. So if folks like the Smith family and
the Jones family are seeking fresh food in Frederick, we think we're
the ones who can meet that for them and I would encourage you to
move forward with that location.
