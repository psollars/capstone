So we've worked through all of
these different decisions that we have to make. Now what we need to
do is tidy up the minor details. To get us started, I want to
emphasize that it's important to attach the source data and
the creator to your visualizations. And this can seem kind of
counter-intuitive, especially if you're preparing a report and your
organization's name is on the cover. So I want to tell you a little story.
You saw this visualization earlier in the course as well, sort of a
variation on the slope graph. And I'll tell you where
I found this graphic. I found it on this Twitter feed.
And Michael Petrelli is the head of the Fordham Institute,
which is an educational think tank. And I thought well, this is interesting.
I wonder if there's more about this. This is actually something I'm
kind of interested in personally. And why is it that lower-income kids'
screen time is going up so much? So I thought I'm going to try to figure
out where there's more context and you'll notice that there is
a shortened URL in there. And so I clicked on it and I got
this blog post on the Fordham site and I saw that here the graphic actually was
labeled with the source, that it came from, Common Sense Consensus/Common
Sense Media, that had been missing here. So I thought okay, I'm going to have
to keep going to find more context. So I searched in Common Sense Media.
I pulled out some keywords to find the source, and I
realized it came out of this report. So the challenge that you want to
consider as you're making visualizations is that in the era of social media,
we are making visualizations that are very easily decoupled from
the text that describes them. And so there can be an advantage
to branding your images, even within a document like this,
with the source information. Because many people are not going to
work this hard to find their way back to the original source information. Which could mean that your data is
attributed to whoever gave the tweet, for example. So it can be helpful, it can be
in tiny font, it can be in gray, to put that source information there. The other thing, and this came up a bit
when we were looking at the Detroit Mayor and the Detroit Revenue debt
animated GIF a few minutes ago. You want to be careful not to take out so much information that things
can't really stand on their own. So here we can see a trend, but
we're not really sure what it is. And if we look back to see how this was
contextualized in the original, we realize that in this case there was an extremely
long subheader to this visualization. And that that subheader is what gave
context to this minimalist graphic. And so here's a case where again,
more information adds more value. So in general, useful
text trumps missing text. And you're not going to know until
you play a little bit back and forth where you're going to
need to add and take away. So you'll want to save time in your
workflow to do that experimenting. And for me that's where a lot of
the fun is, to have that time to be more playful and to be more
experimental and try things. Finally, I just want to talk
very briefly about infographics. Here's another and I define
the difference between a visualization and an infographic that an infographic
is a collection of visualizations. Whereas I see a visualization
as being one image. And here you can see again, I'm going to
show you a close-up in the next slide. You can see that there's a lot going on, but this is created by a university
department and a university center. And so they want to make sure not just
that people see the trend line, but that people understand
more about the science. So if we go and look at this close-up, and it's all a little pixelated here
in order for it to be readable. You'll see here too, that they've
got this explanatory information in their bright orange circle
that draws attention. You'll see they very clearly labeled
the projection with a different type of line style, as we've
talked about before. And you'll see that they've got
these annotations in here as well. So what they're trying to do in this case
as a scientific body is to make sure that they're being clear about
what's being visualized, especially given the challenges with
scientific understanding amongst mainstream audiences. And they tell the story with
a variety of types of images and each one has this explanatory
information that goes with it. It's still a really clean design,
a flat design, but there's more explanation
than we might think is valuable. And let me scooch on to the next one. Here is the bottom one again.
This is a visualization of sea depth and again more explanation of what's going on. Just for fun I also pulled
the infographics from previous years. Now, we're not here to talk
in depth about infographics. But what I want you to see here is that
every year the graphics team is thinking differently about how they
visualize similar information. So you'll notice that 2018 looks
pretty different from 2017. One's using maps, one's using
that sea level depth, and you'll see sometimes there's bar charts. And if we go back two more years,
some you'll see building on previous visualizations from previous years.
You see a little bit of small multiples. I really love how this shows
the dynamism. That it's a report that clearly is branded with the same
organization over time, but that every year they're thinking
fresh about the best ways to show information and challenges
of climate change. All right, so that's that for
this section. I'll see you in the next section.
