Now, if you've been having hives at the thought of having
to learn Inkscape, or play with Excel, or Google sheets, maybe you're looking for an even
simpler solution. There are tools that are increasingly being
created online that are designed for folks who
are not coders to do data, and they work really well
when you're trying to visualize demographic data and consumer data like you're
doing for this project. So I want to show
you one of them, which is Datawrapper. And
notice that it's .de, not .com. You do have to make an
account for this site but one of the things
that's really nice is that it prompts you for some of the best practices that we've been talking
about throughout. So let's take a look. All right, here we
are, I'm logged into Datawrapper and I've pulled this out of my library of
charts that I've made. And I wanted to take a
moment in Datawrapper to show you something we
haven't talked about yet, and that's mapping index data. So you've got a ton of
data in DemographicsNow where you are comparing consumer preferences related
to the average American. And the average American
gets the score of 100 and you show whether you
want maybe to visualize are they more likely than
the average American to agree with a certain
sentiment or less. And you want to be
careful not to make this just a laundry list
of every possible thing. So what we've done here is we've created this really
nice visualization, and I would say we're right on the cusp of this
being too much data. But you'll notice that
when we go through this list of visualizations, that we don't have
numbers like 100 or 112, and that's because we made
an executive decision that with index data, we actually turned
our spreadsheets so instead of saying 100, we had a second column
that said number minus 100, and that got us
to single-digit numbers. And the reason that
that's worth doing here is because if we were
using scales of 100, we would have much
wider visualizations that would take up a lot more space than
we want to use here. But what I like about Datawrapper
is here's your title, your subtitle, your
visualization. Again, we're using
red as the bad color. There's room for an
explanation of the data, and places to show who made it, and where the data came from. You can also publish it, embed it, download it, and if you share this digitally, you can even click
here and get the data. And what you'll notice is that a little CSV file
just downloaded. So let me show you one way, we're going to go back
to that Wisconsin example, to use the data. There is a couple of things here that are
really helpful, though. One is you have the option
of mapping data here. So if you're trying to compare state to state
or region to region, you might find that helpful. You might choose to
use a new table here. In general, I would
have probably just done that right
within PowerPoint. And you also have the
option of a new chart, and that's what I'm
going to show you here. So I have already, over here we have that Annie E. Casey data that we used a while back, so I'll show you that. And
there it is all highlighted. And what we're going to do
is we're just going to copy and paste the data table. You can also upload it. You do want to be
careful in doing this with DemographicsNow data. If you have downloaded
it as a spreadsheet, just be aware that DemographicsNow will put commas in 1,392,492, and you'll want to
remove those commas before you upload the
data because it's essentially treating
the cut and pasted data like a CSV file and those extra commas will
get confusing for the system. And I'm going to click Proceed now. We're just going
to wait a second. You can see there's a
progress bar up here, we talked about progress
bars in Week 2. And now it's asking us
to check the data. And right away I have the
option of swapping rows and columns, or even
adding data later on. Right now, let's see what happens if we leave it as it is. And we're going to keep going. And here, we see, just like
we saw in Google Sheets, we can see right in one example, all kinds of ways
to visualize data, including the dreaded
donut chart. And here, we could see,
I'll bet you anything, this will let us visualize it not only in pie charts but
a bunch of pie charts. And again, you know that this
is a bad visualization, right? So remember that computers
aren't as smart as we are yet and it can't always tell you that you've picked
the wrong version. Okay, so here I am, I did
the line graph. And again, if the story that
I wanted to tell was, "Even over the passage of time, Michigan is still not
looking great," I could leave this as it is, But I'm looking to
make that slope graph instead. So I'm going to go
back to Check and Describe, and that will give me the option to swap
rows and columns, and are you breathless
with anticipation? Here we can see that it's
done that visualization. That's more what we
have looked for. And notice too that if I
were embedding this, you see how it is pulling, it's actually superimposing
some of the data. So that's kind of nice if
you're doing a lot of digital work or you share
things in a Google Spreadsheet. For example, you might be able
to have layers of meaning. And notice over here, you can
even do a colorblind check. You can also choose
different sizes, you can predict what it would look like on
different devices. I can change the
scales of things, I can change the grid lines. So maybe I want to
hide the grid lines. That's a little better. Maybe I want to change
the color scheme. Maybe I want everything
to look kind of orange. And I can adjust
the labels as well. And then I can add annotations. So here is where I
might put my title and then I might
have my description. I hope you'll say something
more professional than this. I even can put notes down here. So I can say pre and post recession data. Here, I can say who
published the data, and I can say it's
the Annie E. Casey Foundation and I could actually
even link to the report. So again, making it
easier for other people. And I can say who made it. I can also choose to
add text annotations, and I can make even more design decisions
than I made previously. And then I can click Publish. And here, I have the
choice to export it, to duplicate it, or to embed it right in my
website or blog post. Now obviously, I've
rushed through this, so we haven't done
enough work with color for this to
make a lot of sense, but you should get a
pretty good baseline of what's working and not working, and what
are our possibilities here. So if you spend a little
bit more time here, I think you can outdo me. And don't forget that there is this mapping tool
which I think you'd really like as a way of getting at some of
that more visual data. Some of you might find as you do your research that
you want to map existing competitors to the Chicken Kitchen
scenario, for example. So this will make that
quite a bit easier for you. All right, so that's all we have to talk
about visualizations. I'll see you in office hours, and have fun exploring
this very simple data and the myriad of
ways that you can visualize it. See you next time.
