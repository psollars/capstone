So, so far in this presentation,
we've talked about rhetoric and we've talked about structure and
to a certain extent, we've talked about the text
of our presentation. In this section, I want to talk
about making data understandable and some of this will be a carryover or
a reminder from last week and some may be a little bit new. So one of the things that I really
want to continue to emphasize in this course is you as translator,
that you are a data scientist. You have a high level of visual and statistical vocabulary with which
to talk with other data scientists. But in this case and in this course,
we are stepping outside that world and we are figuring out how to get
that information that we know understood by amateurs. So that's why we're going to continue
the practice of using very simple visualization styles, things like pie
charts, bar graphs, line graphs, and maps. We had lots of other examples
in last week's lecture. And this will help minimize the amount
of time between you sharing a piece of information and
it being understood by your audience. And that's very important when we only
have a five minute presentation window. So we've talked before about the power of
having two visualization side by side. In this case, showing that over time,
there is an increase In the number of female instructional
faculty in higher ed in the US. And I want to introduce formally
a concept that goes with this and that's the concept of small multiples. I really like small multiples as
a way of communicating a lot of information in a very small
space without animation. And basically it is what you think it is. It's lots of little identical or
near identical charts. So, you can see this is a little bit
shaped like the United States maybe, and the goal of this chart is
there is a little graph for each state and it maps the average life
expectancy for the state and for the US. And if the shading is orange, that means that the state's life
expectancy is higher than the nation and if it's purple it means they have
a lower life expectancy in the nation. So what we get here is this
really kind of cool snapshot that clearly shows that in some regions of
the country people live longer on average than the national average and
in some they live fewer years. So it's a ton of information but rather
than having a line graph with 50 lines on it, we've divided it up into
this little segment and this one comes from 538.com, which is
actually one of my favorite places to find interesting visualizations both
classic styles and pushing the envelope. Here is a really tiny one
from the New York Times. This is meaning to show
a hundred years of drought data. So this one's got lots of tiny maps of the
United States and the amount of orange and the location of the Orange shows whether
there was a drought in that area. And by having a hundred
of these little charts, this is more impactful than having
a whole bunch of numbers and what it really helps us see is that there
are cycles of drought that a region can go several years and be untouched and
then there can be a big swell in drought. And in these cases, you might start with
a big small multiple like you've got here, but then we want to help the viewer focus. So think about what it would be like if we
just showed a couple of decades of drought data and how much data we can see up
close if we move in that direction. And sometimes we might add labels that show that we have three non
drought years in quick succession and then we went a long time before
we had a light drought year. And so we can layer on top of it boxes and arrows that will help us
communicate more quickly. One of the things that really helps us
when we're doing data presentation as well, is this question
of is this a big number? And this comes from the book
The Numbers Game by Blastland and Dilnot. It's got a couple of different covers. One of the things that can be really
hard for novice audiences is to know whether a number is big or impactful. So in the 2016 election, for example, Hillary Clinton won the endorsement of
the National Education Association, which is one of the leading teacher
unions in the United States. Is that a big number? Well, if you know how many people
live in the United States which is about 325 million. That means that that union represented
1% of all citizens not just voters, all citizens and
we get a sense of the size of that number because we can compare it to
something that we're used to. And we can compare in terms of size, distance, time, speed or rate of change. And we do this all the time if
you have a Roku remote control, it's about the size of
a of a Snickers bar. There's a library in the upper peninsula
that describes its service area by saying it's square mile's equivalent
to the state of Rhode Island. It really helps us to get a sense of
how big are we talking about here? So here are some examples
of how that might play out. So this is a graphic
from The Washington Post. It's actually two graphs side by side. On the left hand side,
we see the median income each year between white families and
African-American families. And on the right side,
we see the median wealth, the accumulated money of white
families and black families. And let's think about how we might tell
this story differently depending on which of those comparisons we're using. So if we want to compare size then we
can say that white families in general, on average, are a lot wealthier
than black families and we do that by comparing those two. And so we would highlight the difference
in the size of those numbers and we might do something like this. Maybe what we want to point out in
this data is that no matter how much white families make in
income per year in a median, and black families make in a year,
those numbers go up and down a little bit. But the size of the gap
stays consistent over time. In which case,
we might only show this part and we might add a label that
explains that detail. So you can see we've changed the header,
originally it said racial income and wealth gaps and
we've changed to more active language. So now I've told you what to look at. I've told you to look at the fact
that that gap is persistent. Maybe what we want to talk about
is distance, in this case, the distance between
two values of numbers. So you can see that as the recession
hit there was a dramatic downturn in the wealth of white families. So how might we show that if that's what
we want to talk about in our presentation? We might again change the label and
talk about volatility instead. And all of these are decisions that you're
going to make based on the data that you find, you're going to be looking at how
much of the data do I want to show? How many years do I want to show? Do I just want to show white families,
just black families, show them together? You're going to need to make
all of these active decisions, which you started last week and
we're continuing here. Maybe we want to compare rates. In this case, notice how much longer it
took for wealth to rise dramatically in white families and how little time
it took for them to lose value. So how might we take the same data and
make that point? So here what we've done is
we've literally just shown the white families in this case. We've drawn a dotted line to
show where at its lowest point. What year did that take place in the 90s. And we can see now that it took longer
to earn the money than it did for it to lose value. So I just want to pause here and
give a name to one of the things that we've been talking
about anecdotally in the previous slides. And that's this idea of statistical
benchmarks, which Joel best explores in the book Stat-Spotting,
a Field Guide to identifying dubious data. Which is a book I highly recommend,
it's very short, it's very practical and really helps build some of the day
literacy understandings for novices that can help them be
much savvier consumers of data. Best talks about statistical benchmarks. So comparing new data to more familiar
data as a way of orienting folks. And one of the extension ways we can
think about statistical benchmarking is actually to compare parallel cities. So if you work in civic government at all,
you may know that your government leaders look to
another city in the same state or country that has similar characteristics,
and it looks to them as a peer and sort of it helps them
benchmark against each other. So if you're from Michigan,
Plymouth Canton schools and Ann Arbor schools are often looking at
each other as parallel organizations. Or Birmingham, Michigan and Grosse Pointe,
Michigan both have high income, high services constructions
to government and so they'll check their work
against each other. So you can use comparisons like this
to help people understand the data that you've uncovered. So this is the population clock. This is the official US estimate
of the population of the US and the world at any given time. We're up to about 330 million people so
I can know that to keep that in mind. I also know that there's about
6 million kids born a year, which means there's going to be about 6
million kindergarteners next year and they'll be about 6 million teens who
are eligible to graduate every year. That's maybe not an exact number,
but it gives me a frame of reference that can help me know if something
is accurate or not accurate. So let's say for example, there's been discussion of how many DACA
recipients are there in the United States. This is the program for folks who came
as children to the United States, but don't have formal citizenship. If DACA goes away as a program, about
700,000 people would be implemented and so far since 2012 there have been
900,000 people who have received DACA. I get a sense of how big that is. Because I can compare that to the overall
US population, and really realize that's less than 1 in 300
people is a DACA recipient. And now I have a better
way of calculating whether I think that's a big number or not. And having that comparison gives me a
little bit more accuracy than just saying, ooh, 900,000 is a lot. Another strategy you can use with
data storytelling is to reveal data a little bit at a time. So this is actually from
The Washington Post. They got ahold of whole bunch of drug
enforcement agency data about opioid prescriptions in the United States
between 2006 and 2012. They've published this dataset online, they've published a number of
interactives and visualizations. And if you haven't had a chance to look
at it, I certainly hope that you will. Here you're going to watch every
year the updated data will show you. So we're revealing a little
bit of data at a time. And what I hope you'll see is that the
cumulative effect of revealing a little bit of data at a time makes this more
powerful than say a small multiple might. So a visualization like
this is really good for seeing how this is a crisis that started
in pockets of the United States and you can watch it grow and
grow and grow over time. Now, I do want to emphasize
that this data stops in 2012. We're filming this at the end of 2019. So this not where we
necessarily are right now. But you can recreate this without
an animation by simply having slides that transition, you put the 2006 map on one
slide and the 2007 on the next slide, and the 2008 on the next slide and
you build in transitions and suddenly you can, in a very low-tech way,
recreate this kind of data. And there's something powerful about
watching the crisis grow on this map, a map being a cognitive plan
that we understand really well, that really hammers home
the impact of this disease and the places of the highest
concentration as well. Let's look at another way you might reveal information over time. So there  are two key moments in this visualization from the Washington Post Wonkblog.
One is that the popular vote was much closer than the electoral college vote.
And also That Clinton actually has more popular vote.
And the other big revelation is that of course that a hundred million
people didn't vote. Now this appeared in print in one graphic. But if I were going
use it in a presentation I might split it into a
handful of different slides. So my first slide might first
might just be these two votes. And I might talk  about how the popular vote was quite close
and Clinton did have a larger popular vote. Here I might just point out
that there are six million people voting  someone else. Which is not a statistically important  number at this point. And finally on the next slide I  would just add the hundred million. So I would take this one graphic  and would keep cropping it down as I put it on new slides. So that  very quickly and simply I'm making this. And for my final slide I can  add the header which is this is what I want  you to know about the data. And you'll notice too that we  have the footer. We have the creator of the visualization,  which is Wonkblog, and we have the source of the data.  So if our visualization, in a public document, like Washington Post, gets  disaggregated from the paper gets taken out, and I dunno,  stuck in someone's MOOC about data visualization, the credit continues  to travel with the graphic. And that's really important and something we   talked about in Week 3. You'll also notice stylistically something  which is that there is black text used throughout, until you get  to that horizontal line. And then text gets very light in line weight  and also gets greyed out. So that our eye attention goes to the  color. Goes to the big bold black font. So that's another way that you  can show a little bit over time. That's it for this section. I'll  see you in the next lesson.
