Hi, welcome to Week 4 of our course on communicating data science results. In this week, we're going to
concentrate on presenting on line. We're going to carry over the scenario
we've worked on in the previous weeks and think about how we tackle the
affordances of online presentations. So this week, we're going to talk about
this concept of storytelling with data, which in other circles might be
called structuring your argument. We'll talk about some tips for
graphics and for communicating with
your visualization. We'll talk about some tips for
being an effective presenter. We'll talk briefly about facilitation
of sessions and question and answer and managing the attendees in your sessions. And we'll walk through a sample slide
deck and discuss it as a critique. So in general, we can divide online
presentations into these four categories. One category is video demonstrations,
where you are showing someone how something works, how you fix it,
how to interact with something. One version is informational webinars, where there's no decision
that needs to be made. Someone is giving information and
the understanding is that the goal is to explain something so
the other person learns something. One genre is promotional webinars, and
those are designed to have the effect that someone will want to purchase your service or
take advantage of what you have to sell. And the fourth is
a workplace presentation, where your goal is to argue. And
I don't mean argue like have a fight. I mean argue like you are in
court where you are advancing a perspective that you hope
others will sign on to. So hopefully, you can guess that we're
here to work on workplace presentations. And we're going to carry over in this
area to talk about the same scenario from Weeks 1 through 3 and the
recommendation that you've been making and building on in your executive
summary and your technical report. On the slide, you can see some things
that we want to avoid and some things that we really want to be working toward
in our work with online presentations. One is we are not doing
an informational webinar. So it isn't our role here
to be talking heads or high in the sky ivory tower experts. Instead, we want to really aim for
what is audience-centered. We want the audience to
comprehend what we have to say. We want our ideas to be
very clearly presented. We want to be very careful as data
people that when we are talking to non-data folks that we are avoiding
condescension and talking down. Because our goal is to get folks to want to do what we think is
is the right thing to do. Sometimes I like to think in
terms of splatters and paintings. Sometimes when we do presentations
that have slide decks as their as their cornerstone,
we actually are more like splattering. Here's a splatter of
demographic information. And then the next slide becomes here's
a splatter of economic information and then another splatter. And together what we don't build is a
sense of cohesion around all of those. And that's what we're looking for. We're not here to splatter
a bunch of facts at someone. We're here to paint a painting and for
that painting to be compelling and to guide someone to agree that the analysis
we've done with the data is the way to go. And finally, we don't want them to be
left to draw their own conclusions. Instead, we are hoping that we can
guide them to the conclusions that our analysis shows are correct. And we want folks to be engaged and
feel welcomed in that conversation so that they feel like
they're part of our team. Now let's talk a little bit
about storytelling with data. This is a term that you're
going to hear on and off as you move through data science. And this is a concept that means how do we
build a narrative around the data that we have collected, analyzed,
and drawn conclusions from? How do we borrow the best of
storytellers and actors and create something that is more than just
those splatters of random information? For those of you who for whom
storytelling feels a little off-putting, you can think about this as
structuring your argument. What is it that you're trying
to get people to adopt? And how do you create a world in which
that is the conclusion that they reach? And either one of those approaches
will get you to a similar result in this course. So here's Little Red Riding Hood. She shows up in your readings. And when they're talking about the power
of story and part is in its structure, that stories have beginnings,
they have middles, and they have endings. And if you look across classic
stories across cultures, you see those very same three moments. So in order to help you see
what this might feel like or look like to do a presentation in this
format, I'm really excited to have for you an excerpt from What
the Eyes Don't See. This is a memoir by Dr.
Mona Hanna-Attisha, who has her undergraduate
degree from here at Michigan. She was the Flint researcher, professor,
pediatrician who made the connection that her hospital had data about
lead levels in children that help break open the Flint water
crisis and the fact that the switch in water sources had created a public
health urgency and emergency. And in her memoir, I highly
recommend you read the whole thing. But in this chapter, she's talking
about her presentation that she and her coalition are making
to the then mayor of Flint. They are hoping that he will
choose to stand with them and confront state government
who's repeatedly been saying there's no problem, there's no problem,
there's no problem. And she spends a lot of time talking
about the presentation she gives and why she gives it. And so I think it's a
really nice framing for the kinds of thinking that I
hope you'll engage in this week. So as you read over this
portion of the chapter, here's some things that
are useful to think about. First of all, watch for
beginning, middle, and end. Think about how her structure of
her presentation is organized. When does she think mostly
about emotional arguments and trying to appeal to
the heart of the mayor? And when did she make arguments
that are about science and appealing to the head or
the intellect of the mayor? What feels like the most
powerful set of arguments? What's valuable? What's compelling? What is it that makes this a presentation
that's something to be proud of? And finally, she very strongly
feels that children are endangered by this lead-infused water. And so she wants immediate action. She doesn't want to wait for
a research council or a commission. She wants this problem solved immediately
before more damage can happen. And how does she communicate that need for
rapid action and for urgency? So take a look at the chapter and we'll
come back and talk about it in a bit.
