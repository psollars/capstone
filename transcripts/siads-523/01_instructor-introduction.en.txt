Hello, welcome to 523, Communicating Data
Science Results. My name's Nick Sheltrown, and I'm your instructor. I wanted to create this video as an opportunity to introduce myself to you in the course. The reason why I'm doing
this is because I'm not the person who's delivering
the course lectures, that was another very
talented member of the UMSI faculty who designed and really
created the course. My job is to help
implement the course. I do that in a couple of ways. One is, I hold office hours
regularly, twice a week, where I'll go over
course content, maybe provide my own
amplification of ideas. Also, I'm very active on Slack in terms of answering any questions you have about the course, its concepts, or the assignments. This course perhaps
may be different from other courses you've taken
in your MADS experience. It's not coding base. It's not about developing
your technical skills. This course is about something very big and I think
very important. It's about, how do you
share effectively, clearly in an impactful manner, the insights that you've developed on a data
science project? Now I happen to think this is critical because
of my background. I've been working in data
science for a long time, and I've been in data
science leadership now for many years, for more than ten years. I've hired, trained, developed, many analysts and
data scientists. I got to say that how you communicate your
results is one of the key skills I think that makes for an
effective data scientist. I actually believe
that you'll get hired on your technical
knowledge likely, your ability to code, your engineering capabilities, your understanding of
statistical models. Those are all really important in any kind of job interview, but you'll get promoted based
on how well you communicate your work to key stakeholders in the business or
organization you work for. The other thing I think
about communication is that unlike perhaps
learning about supervised learning or
unsupervised learning, or machine learning, or artificial intelligence, those are all obviously
very important, but you don't use them on every single project you work on, but you use communication in
every project you work on. I think it's something that if you learn how to do it well, it's going to serve
you so well on any of the data science projects that you work on throughout
the course of your career. Now, in the course, we'll be going through some data, and you'll be putting together some analyses and frame
them in the context of executive summaries and other types of business
briefing documents. What you'll notice
is that you're not going to draw down data, clean it, feature engineer, build data models, and
then share the insights. The course is only four weeks, and we really want your
focus in this course, not on doing the analysis, although your analytical
thinking is important in terms of how we score and
grade the assignments, but more so on how you're communicating your
data science insights. The course is going to
provide you principles, and templates, and a lot of
structures, and tools, and support for how you effectively communicate
data science results. We're doing that so as to
help you focus on really the communication aspect of
the data science project and not the data science
aspect as much. It's a little different
in that regard. If it doesn't feel like a data
science project, I get it. It's a little bit more of
an analytical project. But I think that's a really smart choice
given that it gives you the freedom and the space to really go deep into
issues of communication. Again, my name's Nick Sheltrown. I really look forward to working
with you in this course. I hope to see you
in an office hour. I hold those twice a
week or online at Slack. I appreciate you being a part
of this learning community, and I hope you have a
great day. Thank you.
