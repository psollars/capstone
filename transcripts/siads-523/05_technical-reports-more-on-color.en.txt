All right, we've looked at brand standards as a way
of knowing some things about color. Let's continue our color conversation. So here we have the logo for
the completely made-up Chicken Kitchen. And standing on its own,
it's kind of a cool set of vibrant colors. But using these as the cornerstone
of design, as you'll see throughout this course, can create some
weird and challenging problems. And that's because it's very easy for
these colors to become overwhelming. And so this is a case where
we have brand colors that we need to think about
how to both integrate them and also not let them take over and
become eye-poppingly stressful. So let's get off this slide. One of the ways that you can look at
identifying other colors is to think about other colors that sit across
from that color on the color wheel. So you can go go in using
your slide software and figure out what the hex color is. And once you know the hex color for
your PowerPoint or your Google slide, you can actually type it
in to the Canva color wheel that we linked to at the start
of this week's course. And when you do that, it's going to let you have a set
of choices from a drop-down menu. And it will talk about what's a tertiary
color, what's a complementary color. And honestly, it's not important for you to know what all of
those color variations are. What I would do is I would flip through
all the choices until I found another color that might seem more appealing. And then if it's PowerPoint, you can
go back into shape fill or font color. And you can type in the resulting
hex code from Canva. And now you've got a different
color that you can use to balance out that logo color that
might be a little bit overwhelming. You can do this both for PowerPoint, as
we showed on the previous slide, and you can also use it as we
show here with Google Slides. You would do this by
identifying a custom color. Sometimes I also just use the color
picker, the little eyedropper feature in slide deck software, to pull a color that
matches out of, say, a photograph as well. But for me, that's what got me this
color palette that's this sort of citrine yellowy-green color and the pink. It gives me a little bit
more variety to work with. It keeps me loyal to the brand color. But it also got me over the issue of how
hard it was to work with this color. You'll also notice that when I am
using some font variations for preattentive attributes that I've
just italicized and changed the color. And I did that instead of bolding because
when I bolded it, it just made that pink just totally dominate the page in ways
that I didn't think were really helpful. And that's one of those things
with preattentive attributes. You always have to be, as we
talked about in the previous week, you always need to be toggling between how
much do I want something to stand out and what are the strategies
I have to use it. Do keep in mind that if you decide that
this is how you're going to highlight text on this page, again, it should be
consistent across every page. And I saved the world of pink, all pink, all
the time, for things like a background slide. So this happened to be as I was
working on Frederick County, I thought I might just have a whole
page that's just this quote. And this is a great place where we
want that wow of a bright color. But it's not going to get in the way
of our comprehension of the text. And you can see I also used it here
on the Table of Contents page. Again, visual impact, but it's not going to stress me
out to read the whole page. Now, you may be looking at
this Table of Contents and thinking that's exactly what
I'm going to write down and do. Those are going to be the exact
focus areas for my data. Well, they may be or they may not be. And that's going to depend on
when you are doing this data for each of your communities what
pops up as being important. And that's going to be
different in every scenario. So you're going to have to
make some of those choices. And we'll talk about what the required
elements are a little bit later in this week's lesson. Another place you can go to get familiar
with new colors or even new fonts. There is a Chrome and Firefox extension
called Palettab tab that every time you open a new tab will
display a color family, a series of colors that look good together,
and also a series of fonts as well. And I don't always have this
Chrome extension turned on. But when I start feeling like
my own everyday use of color and font gets to be a little bit repetitive or boring, I'll turn this extension on for
a couple of weeks. So I can just sort of start thinking
again about other color choices, other fonts that I might consider.
So I highly recommend this as a way to get your visual thinking
going if that's a concern for you. Now, on the next section, we're really going to
roll up our sleeves and talk about layout. So I'll see you there.
