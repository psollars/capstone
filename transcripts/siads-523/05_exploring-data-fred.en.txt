Welcome back. Now we're in our continuing series of looking at various
sources for data. We're going to take
a look at FRED. Now, FRED is a project of the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis. And what they do is they
aggregate all kinds of government data and all kinds of economic data, some corporate, some government, and
mash it all up in a really amazing powerful tool that you can access
on line for free. So I'm going to show you
this data because I think it can have value not
only for this assignment, but as a great source for
other datasets moving forward. As you can see from the home page, there are a ton of
series of data in FRED and we are
only going to take the tiniest look today. There are so many
tools and series that you could get lost
in here for hours. And I think as you move forward
in your data science career, you're going to really
like coming back to this site over and over. Sometimes I come
here and I just type in some words to see
if there's anything. But I want to get
started by looking at what data they have
for Kendall County. So you can see that I've
already searched it. But let me just type in here, because this is not a
pull-down menu choice. You just type in the
county and the state. And what it's going to do is it's going to show
you that there's 71 series or 71 sets of
data about Kendall County. And you'll want to take a
look at which data is seasonally adjusted and
not seasonally adjusted, so that you can ideally, when you're comparing
datasets, match them up. I'm interested in SNAP benefits, which are nutrition
benefits for younger folks. It's going to help me get a sense of,
sort of be a proxy for poverty. Do you see how it instantly assumed that I wanted
to visualize this data? And this is really helpful to me. We'll deal with this this hole in the data
in a little bit. You'll see these
vertical bars and these represent periods of recession. And this is a great example
where layering and a little bit of data is
going to add a lot of value. And you can see that it's
made a default chart. This is by percent, and down here, there's a slider. And the slider will
determine how much data you're going to show at
any particular time. And remember that our goal
is never to misrepresent the data by deciding
how much we choose, but we want to make
sure that we are highlighting the part of the data that is
the most valuable. So that's a little do-si-do that you'll have to manage
as we go through. But if I move the slider, let's say I just want to
see right before the 2007, 2008 recession, and that gives me just data from a
certain period of time. And you'll also see that
the most recent data they have is 2017. What's really cool
is it tells you it got this information
from the Census Bureau. It's cited back to the source. It's pre-branded with the logo. As we go through in Week 3, we'll talk about maybe
stripping that out and putting that
information somewhere else. And then if you don't know
anything about that data, there's this description
below including a link, and there's even a citation. So it's a really
amazing all-in-one. Now, lest you think
I'm an infomercial, I do have to say, but wait, there's more. And if we go over here
to edit the graph, we can actually add other lines of data and
we can also customize it. But let's add a line. Sometimes I just go through
and I see what's available. Here again, we have to
type in the county. I've looked at SNAP already. Let's look at
children in poverty, and we're going to
add that series. Now you'll see we
have two lines of data and I'm going to x out
of this for just a minute. And both are being
measured by person, so we only have one
axis that's labeled. Now let's go back into Edit Graph and let's see what
else we can find. And remember, in this
exploratory phase, you might not know what
you're looking for. So let's click add line again and see what else is available. I keep forgetting
to type that part. And now we start to see
those results come up. And the thing I think I
want to look at next is subprime credit populations. So you know Equifax is one of those big credit
reporting agencies. Had a little problem
with data privacy. I'm just going to see what
happens if I add that. I'm going to add
that data series. Now you'll see if I
x out of this that something kind of
interesting is happening, and that's that it's layered. We're now tracking two types
of data on the same axis. And I can fix that by going
back into Edit Graph, and going to Format, and I can change all
kinds of things. I can change the
type of graph it is, I can change whether
they're stacking or not, I can turn the recession
shading on and off, I can change the text color, I can change the
color of the line, and I can change the
y axis position. So because subprime
credit is measured in percent and not as
number of persons, I'm going to move that to right. And now you see that the
data about persons we measure on the left column, and percent is used
on the right side. And when you're done, you can
do all kinds of cool things with it. You can download just the
data in Excel or CSV, you can download the image, you can download it as
a PowerPoint slide, or you can even
download it as a PDF. Now, in Week 3, we're going to talk about how we might pretty it up a little bit, and emphasize what we
think is important, and determine how we're going to frame this
for our report. But for now, you've got
something you can look at. And so what we learned
from looking at this is that the
percentage of folks in poverty is not changing
significantly over time. You can notice, too, how I
can hover over data points and it will show you
some descriptions. SNAP benefits kind of
go up and down, and that's measured
in terms of persons. And I can also look at the Equifax subprime
credit population. And that number's
actually going down, which can feel counter-intuitive, but that's a good
thing because it means fewer people have
subprime credit. Now there's all kinds of
other stuff in FRED. There is a mapping feature, there are economic activities if you happen to be
a teacher out there, but what I find is that this gives me a really quick snapshot, faster than it would be to
crunch all the data myself. And now I can make some decisions about what I want to
have happen next. In the next section,
let's talk about open web research that will
help you with your project.
