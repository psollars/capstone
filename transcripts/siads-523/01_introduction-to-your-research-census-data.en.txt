Welcome back. Whenever I get started looking at
a new community, and that's something
I actually do pretty regularly in my non-teaching
part of my job, I always want to start and get a snapshot
of where we are at this particular moment
in time in a community. So I always do that
by using census data. Now before we delve
into that census data, I do want to reiterate that everybody's background
is different. So when I walk through
some of these sites, if you're already familiar with them, don't worry about it. We're trying to get everybody
on a level playing field. I also want to take
a little bit of time before we start this
research process by talking about the
work of Carol Kuhlthau, a Professor Emerita from
Rutgers University. She was really the first
person who thought about how we do research, how our thinking goes as the
research process develops, what actions we're doing, and to me the most important is what emotions go along
with each phase. So if you start by looking
at the top header, you'll see several phases
of the research process. One is getting started, and that's actually where you were when you
started this course. What's this course?
What's going on? What is she going
to ask us to do? Now you're getting to
the point where you've hopefully selected a topic, and you're probably
feeling like, "Oh, maybe this will be weird and fun and different from
what we've been doing." Then we're going to start
the exploration process. And this can be really frustrating for students because you're going to look at a bunch
of stuff and not quite know what's important yet. And no matter how many times I
tell my residential students you will come out of this phase, you will feel better, and this is normal, this often feels really like you're sort of wandering
in the wilderness. There is both so much data and yet there is no cohesive
thread developing for you yet. But as you start to continue
to delve into data, if you do delve into data you will reach this
point where you will formulate your
recommendation. And you will feel a
feeling of clarity, like I think I really do understand these two areas enough
to make a good decision. That may result in
needing to collect a new kind of data or to organize it differently in your presentation. You make your presentation,
whether that's a report or a visualization or a webinar or a
video conference, and you feel one way
or another about it. And hopefully, if you put
your best into something, then when you go back
and think about how do I access this project, you do have a sense
of accomplishment. And I say this because looking at census data
can be kind of overwhelming. It's just a lot of
numbers that don't really make a lot of
sense right away. It's also part of why we use Census Reporter as
our first place to look at census data
because it actually auto-visualizes some data for us, which helps with that
immediate understanding. From a cognitive perspective,
Kuhlthau's research shows that researchers often feel like things feel awfully vague. It's hard to come up with
what are these communities, and what am I trying to do here? But again, as you get over that exploration
hump of frustration, and you get that clarity
and that sense of focus, you will go through
a period, I think, where you start to realize you're getting more interested
in something. Because now all the information that you're
encountering helps you solve something about this mystery of that community. And hopefully, you have an increased self-awareness
at the end. And finally from a
physical perspective, you're going from exploring information to documenting
what you've found, and from seeking relevant
information, and remember, it may not feel relevant at the beginning, to seeking
pertinent information. What is the information that, now that I know
what I want to do, helps me make that argument? So if at times you feel
like the numbers are just sort of rolling over you, think back to this
process because this is what happens with
all researchers, and it's easy under the gun
when we are stressed in a short-term course like
this to lose sight of the fact that research
is by nature ambiguous, and doesn't always give us
clear answers right away. So not knowing until
you know is normal. So what I want to do is show you some over the next
couple of videos, I want you to think about
some starter sources. And again, if you have access
to other resources, or you want to delve more deeply, or there are other questions that arise that can't be
answered with these sources, you should never feel like
you're constrained by them. But I've picked out a few that are helpful when I do this work in hopes that you
will find the same. So we'll work through
these one at a time. I won't bother
reading them to you, but they'll give you
a bit of an overview. I want to start today by
looking at CensusReporter.org. Now the US Census is a
federally funded project. It's part of a federal agency, and yet lots of companies and organizations
take that data and package it in their own way. So we never want to say that our data comes from
Census Reporter, we really want to
say that the data comes from the census. And there's sort of two types of
census data we're going to meet in this course. One is American
Community Survey data, which is nicknamed ACS. That is a small data set that's representative of
the entire nation that gets checked every year. And every year, in
usually late September, the newer year's worth of
ACS data comes out. And it always has the date that's a year behind
where we were. So they collect it in one year, they take nine months to get it organized, and they present it. So in fall 2019, we got ACS 2018. The advantage here is that
the data is relatively new, and that's really useful. Here in 2019, the only
ten-year census we have, and that's when they
ask every person in the United States, is from 2010. That was when we were coming
out of the recession, or in Michigan still struggling to come
out of the recession. That data may not readily
represent where we are or who we are in 2019. So any time we're dealing with should we be dealing
with ACS data or decennial census data, we're playing that game between the decennial census being
100 percent participation but older, versus newer
but less representative. So one of the things that we sometimes run into
when we're looking at ACS data is some uncertainty
or margin of error. And this is particularly true
if you're looking at smaller communities where they may have a very
small sample size, and feel hesitant about
making any assumptions. So be mindful of watching for those
clues as we go through. So let's pop over
to Census Reporter and take a look at what
we might find there. So here we are at
CensusReporter.org, and we get started up here, up where it says Profile. We're going to start typing the name of what we're
going to look at. And I'm going to start by
looking at Kendall County, Texas and the reason that I am actually showing you
how the search goes is because you actually
have to scroll down to pick the option you want, otherwise, the search
won't get triggered. So let's see, let me put a couple more letters in and see if that gets
me a little closer. It shouldn't be so hard
to find. There we go. Kendall County, Texas, and
we can even check that yes, we mean the county
of Kendall County. Sometimes there's
several possible areas we could look, and
I'm going to click. And what it does is pull up
this really nice map. There's usually a little map
that pops up behind here, but it must be on vacation today. So instantly we start
to be fed some data. So here, I'm noticing that Census Reporter is
showing 2018 data in some regions at
the time we filled it and 2017 in others. So I think it's still transitioning
over to the new year. So it says the
community is about 40,000, that it's over 600 square
miles, which sounds enormous, but that could be just 25 square miles
times 30 square miles, somewhere in there, and that there's 60 people
per square mile. Now this data probably doesn't
mean very much at all. I happen to know there's
a little bit more than a 100,000 people in
the place I live. So I know that this is a county that although it's
a lot of square miles, it's a lot less people than
we have here in Ann Arbor. Now I'm going to
start scrolling down, and take a look at what kind
of data is presented to me. So I'm going to think aloud and see if
that helps you out. So I'm always interested
in looking at the beginning at median age, which we can find right here. And it says that it's about
42.4 plus or minus 0.6, it's gone up 0.6, sorry, which means it's higher than the overall age of
residents in Texas, and it's 10 percent higher
than the US median age. Now in and of itself, that data may not mean a lot. Where it really starts
to become meaningful is what happens when we
watch age over time. So one of the things that's a phenomenon in
Michigan right now is that a large number of counties are getting
much older every year, which means that there isn't a birth rate that is
keeping pace with things. And that makes me a little
bit concerned because it means that there's going
to be a greater demand for senior services, and it also means that what happens in a
community that isn't rejuvenating as fast as
folks are becoming elderly, raises real questions about the long-term viability
of a community. And this is a community
that's large enoiugh that the only place we get that margin of error
note is right here. So we want to be
just sort of mindful that that data could go either way. And it's at least 10 percent, which means there
could be zero people, or zero percent, that are over 80, but it could be as
high as 14 percent. And we'll talk about that
a little bit more when we talk about visualizing
margin of error. But I see a pretty decent
range of folks across things. It looks like actually the youth population
is growing quickly, so I'm less worried about
this community aging overall, and a little over half
are between 18 and 64. So that means we've got about
a quarter that are youth, and not quite a quarter
that are seniors. So that looks pretty healthy. This gender one, I
think this is one of the most useless things
that we could visualize. I mean, it's easy to do, but very rarely does it tell
us anything very profound. In mining communities or
forestry communities, where it's a mono industry
dominated by men, sometimes the male number
creeps up a little higher. Sometimes in highly urban
areas where there's a really high incarceration rate, especially of
African-American males, we'll see that it tips a little
bit more towards female. But this is a great example
right at the start of our project of something that probably doesn't need
to be visualized. I would file this under
common knowledge. There's nothing
that unusual here, so we don't need to bring it up. I can look at race a little bit, I'm being mindful again of
these margins of errors here, and looking at the fact that it's a majority White community, about 23 percent Hispanic. We've been doing some work with community profiles in
New Jersey lately, and one of the things that we're discovering there is
that communities that have been predominantly
White for a 100 years or so are now seeing
influxes of other races. So again, in and of itself, this snapshot doesn't
mean anything, but we might want to
track things over time, as that indicates that there's
potentially going to be some challenge to the traditional Caucasian culture of a community. Now I'm going to look at
economics a little bit. Here it tells me that the per capita income
is about $40,000, and it says here that's
a little bit higher than the median per capita income
in the United States, and that the median household
income is about $81,000, and that's still more than it would be in the United States. But I noticed something
interesting over here, which is that it's a
relatively small population of people who make over $200,000. So if I were in the philanthropic business or the not-for-profit business, and I was reliant on donors, I would want to
keep that in mind. But I'm not going to think too deeply about
it because all of these numbers have that
margin of error notice, which means that these numbers
could actually be in flux. I'd do better to look at
this data over time. It looks like the poverty level is quite a bit lower
than in other places. So automatically, I'm starting to see a couple of things that are useful for me as I'm planning my Chicken Kitchen
recommendation. First, I'm seeing a
higher than average income, I'm seeing a large
population of children, a little population bulge, and I'm seeing that there is
a much lower poverty rate, which means that there's
a much bigger pool of people who could afford this. But I'm also mindful that the overall population for
the whole county is 40,000, and that does not seem like necessarily the best
thing in our favor. It says that there's 31.2 minutes
of travel time to work. That means they're spending
a lot of time in the car. That speaks well for people who are looking for fast food, and the higher income
means that they're likely to be ready for
higher-end fast food. And most of them drive alone. So that tells me that there's a lot of people
who are going through. So it also means if
the only land that's available is a place that
doesn't have a drive-through, I might question whether
that's the right space. When it comes to households, when I'm trying to look at
feasibility for a community, I'm not going to worry too much about persons per household. It's a little bit
higher than the state, and it's a little bit
higher than the nation, but there's nothing
extraordinary here. I do find sometimes
that percentage of married couples
makes a difference. So here we have a place where when you've
got three quarters of households have
married couples, that brings a little
bit more stability, that's part of why
the income may be a little higher in this community. I'm not sure that there's anything I want to
do with that yet. Here too, we see that over half of the population of folks
15 and over is married. That is usually a sign of economic stability,
though not always. And I'm not sure that
there's anything here that's really significant, not for our scenario. I'm going to leave
fertility kind of as is. This isn't information that's going to really
help me figure out something about potential buyers and potential customers for me as well as the
population told me. I'm going to look too down here
at units and occupancy. There's a couple of
things I look for here. First, I see that they
are mostly occupied. And today, this is a really
weird data point that maybe was less weird before. This makes it sound
like 11 percent of the houses are sitting empty, and that could be the case. But sometimes vacant is also the code for vacation homes where people have filled
out their census data not at their vacation home but at their primary residence, and therefore that property appears not to have anybody living in it, even if it's owned. And Airbnb, if they are standalone properties
where the owner doesn't live on the property, those would also be
considered vacant. So this is a real sort of
confusing piece of the puzzle that you'd probably want to
delve a little bit further in. I've had folks from resort
communities run this and get very concerned about
the vacancy rate, when in truth, it's just
a lot of second homes. I also notice that
there's a really high owner occupancy rate. That means there aren't so many households that have renters. This is a more stable
community that it means that if we build
relationships with people, they're likely to be
long-term relationships. That's a really good sign. Mostly single-family housing. That makes sense for a
good chunk of America. And you really see that there's been sort of a big boom as we've sort of
entered the 21st century right here. That looks pretty optimistic. I also see that houses
are worth a lot of money, even by Michigan standards. You can get a decent
house for $300,000. So if people can
afford that, again, they can probably
afford to eat out. Here we're looking at
geographic mobility and who has moved around from
the previous year. And what we see here is that
lots of people did not. But one of the things that
can be interesting is that people who do move have
moved from another county. And sometimes that means that there's a big
metropolitan market, and people are moving into maybe from the urban setting
to a suburban setting, and when that fills
up, they're moving to an exurban setting that may
be in a different county. But again, not a
ton of migration. Really well educated. That correlates to
economic success, but that doesn't
necessarily mean anything. And a large English-speaking
population shown here. Small foreign-born population, mostly from Latin America. Makes sense for a
Texas community. And usually for the point
of this project, veteran status doesn't
tell me very much. So as we wrap up this tour, I won't bore you by continuing with the other county under
consideration for this sample, you'll notice that
we got some answers, we got some questions, we got some things that we have a feeling aren't relevant at all, and all of that is normal. It just gives us a snapshot
of where to start. And we're going to use that to
inform the next place we go, which is we're
going to next go to the census and their
QuickFacts tool. I'll meet you over
there in a second.
