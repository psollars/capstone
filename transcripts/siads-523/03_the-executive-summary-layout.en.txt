Okay, now let's talk about
laying out the summary itself. So you saw this example, and
what we did here was this is a blend of HelveticaNeue and that
Webley Sleek UI that we looked at. That's the free download font. Now, I'll let you read
this on your own time. We'll have a copy in the course shell for
you, but you can see that quick summary. Some reasons on the left and
the recommendation on the top. You can also see this is
a slight variation. Here, we've got these three
stacked boxes on the left. And here what we're doing is
sort of telling a subnarrative, which is that not only are we
recommending Frederick County, but we're recommending it because
there's this additional data about the impact of college students
and eating out. You'll also notice this one
is pretty simple, right? You just see the headers broken out,
but you don't see anything else. It doesn't even have action steps on it. Here we've rearranged it a little bit. This time, we've used
Roboto Condensed and PT Sans. These are both Google fonts, and
all Google fonts can be found online for download to use on your
desktop applications as well. Here you start to see we've got
a little bit more preattentive attributes going on. So we've got the section headers
are a different color and they're larger in font size and you can see we've got some
bolded information as well. And we've moved that little story about
the college over to the right-hand side. Now, I'm going to pause with this one
because this is a real challenge, and you're going to see this
look again in the report. You can see this has a very different
tone for a couple of reasons. One is that it uses the font
Montserrat, which is a wider, kind of more rounded font
than even HelveticaNeue is. And secondly, the pink. So as a design challenge, what
happens when the logo colors for your organization are not cute? And so we're going to look over the next couple
of weeks about how far you lean into it, what does it look like when
it doesn't work so well, and when you need to pull back. So here we've kept
the same font throughout. We've just used it in different
font styles and weights. And here we've taken a different approach. Here, we want to keep that
executive audience in mind. Maybe your executive is
really drawn to color. In which case, you might pull a stock or
public domain photo and stick it in the margins. I put this one in, and this is Candara,
which is another Google font. You might consider this is yet
a third font. But also notice that using these
dark colors next to each other, this dark brown for the headers and then the executive summary in black,
it pulls from the colors of the photo but it's a slightly more somber
description of text. Now, we made all of these and then just before we recorded,
this sentence popped in my mind. Coco Chanel, who said before you leave
the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off. What she was trying to say
is that overdecorating is not the way to go with wardrobe. And I thought, I wonder if before I leave this slide
deck, I should take one thing off. So she also said it's always
better to be underdressed. And as you're seeing,
as you go through these slides, you'll see every now and then there's
a slide that is chock full of stuff. And then you see another slide where
there's just lots of white space and breathing room around it and
that feels more relaxed. So I thought I think I should
take another look at this. So this was a color version that I tried. I looked across the color wheel to
the color that was on the opposite side of that pink color. And I thought, well,
maybe this lime green color. It would let me use the color of
the company, this pink color, but not so much of it. And I tried that, and as I looked at it,
I kind of liked the less pink. And I realized that in adding these
preattentive attributes, I think what I had really done was there was a lot
of stuff that was getting bolded. And the columns were
getting kind of narrow. So it was actually that phenomenon
of getting harder to read. Maybe I could do something else. So in honor of Coco Chanel,
here's the remake. Here we see we've been able
to make the font larger. We've gone down from five columns,
four text columns and that green description
of Frederick County. And we've bolded the action steps instead. And I became much more careful and judicious about how much
information I put in. Actually, there's quite a bit less text
here than there was on this slide, and suddenly I felt like
things came into balance. And so it's always worth in this course asking
that question of what can I take off? What can I remove? Or what's a different way to do this? And I find that if I work through
a design, I gain confidence as I go. And if I ask myself that question, I can ride my confidence
into trying something new. If I don't ask that question, then I
actually just go on to the next thing and start over. But sometimes that extra confidence
lets my imagination go a little bit, and I can suddenly see a new way to
do it that I couldn't do it before. Now, you have a big task
ahead of you for this week. You're going to spend a couple of hours figuring out the data
that you want to use. You will need more data for the technical
report next week than you do for the executive summary. All you're going to turn in at the end
of this week is the executive summary. So do all the research first so
you can pick and choose what goes in the executive
summary and save the rest for next week. I hope it's fun for you to
explore those data sources and imagine other ways in which you could
use that data for other projects. We'll look forward to seeing what
you've settled on by looking at your executive summary using one of the templates or
a template of your own. And we'll pick up next week and keep talking about construction
of the larger report. We'll see you next week.
