Now, let's walk through some of the common data formats that you might use when you're
communicating with novices. This puts us in the section on our visualization here about
trying potential displays. So you know if you do a
Google search for dashboards, you're going to
see a whole lot of things that look like this, and here we see the data is being converted into the
most simple forms. And we're going to carry over
that dashboard concept into our work both for this technical report that's
due at the end of this week, and in Week 4, when we go
to online presentations. These are the forms
people recognize, they understand
intuitively what they mean, and if we
construct them well, we can actually deliver
a lot of value visually. Now, sort of here's my nutshell
approach to various formats, and we're going to go into
each of these in detail, so I won't read them
aloud to you here. These are my go to's, and we'll talk through strengths and weaknesses of each one or what
they might be for. But I find sometimes
just asking myself, what I'm trying to do? Okay, let me try it, or cycling through these
will help me find value, find interesting patterns,
and then communicate them. So I'm not going to
duplicate the content about the grammar of graphics that you've been through in some
of your other courses. We're going to be
really pragmatic here. We're going to talk about moving efficiently and effectively to leverage those practices
into your published work. So we're going to walk
through some visualizations. We're going to talk
about what's working and maybe what's not working so much. First, I want to make sure
that it's in your toolkit that sometimes you might just make a really big number
in a really big font. So consider this example
from The Economist. I'm an enormous fan of Economist visualizations and I really love their Twitter feed, I'm constantly bookmarking things there as great examples. Here's an example where all they've done is give
us one percent. Now they've cited their data, they've shown who is
publishing this data, who packed it up, which
is the Economist, and all it is is how much
are robocalls going up. This is as close to data speaking for itself
as it can be, right? If we know that there
was an increase by of almost 50 percent in 2018, we can have sort of have awe and appreciation for how
big a deal that is. We can think about the
robocalls we use to get, we can think about the
robocalls we're getting now. The idea that we're
actually getting 50 percent almost more
robocalls than we did, say, during the 2016 election is pretty remarkable to me. So this is a really
simple format. You don't want to use
this all the time, but sometimes when it's just
a kind of wowser number, this is a perfect way to go.
And you would do this, I would probably make
this in PowerPoint, I would make some text boxes, and I would manipulate
them and move them around. Now, sometimes there's
just a great density of information that you're trying to communicate in a
very small space, and you want people to be able to compare that data rather quickly. That's when tables can
be a really good option. Here's a nice example of a table that is presenting a good
density of information, but it's also trying
to guide the reader into understanding what's
valuable about it. So you'll notice that there are three sets of numbers in
the first three columns, and then in the
final two columns, they're performing the analysis for the reader and they're pointing out where there are significant changes
using bolded text. Now, when we look
at tabular data, you'll notice that it's
often quite common for the numerical data to be centered, as you see
in this example. And if you look down the column, this column right
here that looks at dollar sales in millions, you'll notice that the decimal
point doesn't line up, and because of that, our data doesn't really line up, and it really masks the enormous difference between private label and
Ben and Jerry's. You'll also notice that this
dollar sign continues all the way down, even though
it has a label up top, and you'll notice that
the percent change, we don't see the percent
sign going all the way down. So in general, when we
think about numbers, we can make some big
improvements from the example on top to the example on the bottom. First of all, always try right justification
first with numbers. Now, you'll notice as we go through the examples in
this week's lessons, I come from visualizing data, from thinking about graphic
design for beginners. And so you'll notice when I
work through things, I still as my first
step left justify things, and then as one of my last
steps, I right justify. And that's just because information makes more sense to me when I start that way and then I go in and clean it up afterwards. You'll want to make sure you
line up the decimal point. So if you notice in
the top example, the data doesn't really line
up. When we have profits that are two digits in front
of the decimal point, the ones and the tens
don't line up, if you think back to
elementary school math. And we have one ticket type that has $21 and no decimal points. You'll want to think
about moving labels, whether those are symbols like
dollar sign, or millions, or the percent mark,
up into the header of your table instead of cluttering up in the
data column itself. Now, you've got a
really complicated table where you're dealing with one column that's dollars
and one column that's yen and one column that's percent, and you realize that
those numbers are all running together because
you've removed those marks, then of course you
would bring them back. Or if you have a boss that's a real stickler for little details or who
is easily confused. You want to standardize
those digits back to the right of
the decimal point. So if you compare the top
example to the bottom, that flat $21 profit, we've added two digits post the decimal point to
keep things aligned. Sometimes, depending on the
type of data you're doing, you actually find that you
are going to round up data to the nearest dollar or to the nearest million depending
on the data you're using. In which case, if you do
do some rounding, make sure you note that at the bottom and make sure
it's in an environment where doing that kind of rounding
would be appropriate. And finally, just a
small pet peeve, which is that sometimes
we see data where all the data seems to be
floating in the table, and that's because the header that describes the data below it, so in this case, in the top box you see here we have
all these words to describe the tickets, is bloating the
width of the table. And we want to be careful
always about ever having too much space that separates the data that we're
supposed to be looking at because that makes it a
little harder from the eye, for the eye to track
from here to here. So if you look below, we've reduced the
amount of space between the ticket type names
and the profit. So for our next example, let's take a look at tabular data that is
word-based instead of numeric. And this is top five most
popular dog breeds by year. The data comes from the
American Kennel Club. If you look up and
down this chart, it doesn't look bad, right?
because the switch from Boston terrier to Cocker
spaniel is not significant. But when we start going down
into the less popular names, we really see these big kind of
weirdly shaped columns that emerge because we're
centering the data. So often the rule of thumb with words in tables
is to left justify. So if you look at
the example below, there are just fewer shifts in visual appearance
for us to keep track of. Now, in this case, you'll notice that we've varied some
of the alignment. So we used to see often that whatever the colored
top row was in spreadsheet data would be
centered all the time. What we're increasingly
seeing design-wise is moving that top row over to being
left justified instead. But you'll notice
that when it came to this row, which
delineates the rank, we kept those centered,
though we could take a look at what it does look like
if we left justify it. So let's do that and see if
we like that any better. I don't know. I still
think I like it centered. But you'll notice
that in this case, unlike the example on
the previous page, sometimes I right
justify whatever that first column when it
has descriptive information, in this case, the year, here, I right justified it just to tug it a little bit closer to the names of the dogs. So again, you can
experiment a little bit and see what
works best for you. Scatterplots are a lot of
fun because they give us a way to show data that may
not be related to each other. In some cases they are, but in some cases they're not. So we're not going to
draw lines past things, but we might pull out some
conclusions about that. And for that, I'd like to go take a look at
this New York Times one. This was brought
to my attention by my colleague Florian Schaub, and this is an example
of trying to figure out how do you visualize and show how privacy policies
are constructed. How do you turn that into data? So we're looking at this
New York Times article, and this is a trend in
visualization that we're seeing scrolling sets of visualizations
in journalism right now. And while animation is not something we're
covering in this class, always think about
how you can use the transitions features in
a PowerPoint slide when you get to presentations
to replicate some of what this looks like by combining a series of still images. So the idea here is
they're trying to get a handle on how big they are, how long they are, and how
hard they are to read. So all of a sudden, we're going to see this
data pop up. There we go. So they started their
visualization just with this timeline and this is
measuring how many minutes it took someone to read
each of these policies. And you see a couple
of nice things about this scatterplot, right? You see that there
are a bunch of dots, but they've sort of been
receded into the background, your textbook author would
probably have made them gray, and they've forefronted some companies as sort of
proxies for data along that line because these
are sites that you are likely to have used before and maybe to have reviewed the
privacy policy. So it's setting some
context for us. But let's keep going and
see what pops up next. Now they explode this data out. And you'll see that they're
keeping that x axis, what looked just like
a simple timeline, and now on the y axis they're adding what's known
as the Lexile level. And this is a proprietary
way of measuring the complexity or
the reading level that it takes to read the policy. And you see now that the
data is starting to look a little bit different and
they're kind of all over the place. And we wouldn't want to draw
any lines to connect this, we're not seeing trends, we're just seeing sort of a
bunch of phenomena dots, right? So let's keep going
and watch how they add to the scatterplot
to add meaning. And what they've done here is, you probably were saying, I don't know what
a Lexile number is, unless maybe you have a
kid in school right now. I used to work in K-12 education, so I know what that means. What they've done here
is that they've layered on these colored bands
and they've said, let us make sense for
you in words you might understand of what
these Lexiles are. So these are just simple
text box overlays. You could make this
in PowerPoint, you could use the
transparency feature to change the opacity and
transparency of things, and you now have a whole new
conceptual understanding of what this plot means. And if we keep going, we can also now see another way of adding
meaning to this plot. Text covers this up a little bit, but you see these green
points on here are showing you well-known
works of literature. This is Brief History of Time, this is the Stephen Hawking book. And now we can understand that a Facebook policy is harder to read than the Stephen
Hawking book, and I think the Stephen Hawking
book is a challenge to read, and how few of them are as
easy to read as Harry Potter. So I'm going to get
that mouse out of way. There's a nice view of it. What you can see is that
this scatterplot has used a lot of
different strategies. Color as a preattentive
attribute, it's looked at bands that help make sense of
what numbers mean. It's just a really gorgeous
elegant way to communicate a lot of information in
a really simple way. All right. Let's head back
over to the slides, and let's head back in to
talking about line graphs. Line graphs' big claim
to fame is that they show change over time. So for example, this is from the American
Enterprise Institute. You can see that what
they're trying to do is they're trying to show you which things are getting
more expensive over time and which things are getting less expensive over time. And so they're using red as sort of
a hot kind of warning color on top, and blue as a calm
color on the bottom. So they're using color
as a way to communicate, and they're also using labels. You notice that instead of giving each line its own color and then putting a key at the bottom, what we're seeing is a
kind of clustering of color. You're either getting cheaper or you're getting more expensive. We're not using 12 colors
that defaulted in Microsoft, and various intensities
of those colors as well. Also notice that at the
bottom of this visualization, we know where this
data came from. BLS is the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. A lot of their data shows up in the FRED portal that we looked at in Week 1 from the Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and you can also see that the organization
itself has branded this visualization so
that when this got pulled out of the online article
that went with it, we still know that
it's their work. So welcome back to FRED, another great example
of line graphs. I hope that you enjoyed
playing with FRED as you made your executive
summary and as you're working towards your
technical report. I just want to point out that
one of the things that line graphs
increasingly do is they either have two y axes
or they use sort of a double axis on one side of the y axis to represent two
different kinds of data. And you have to be really careful about
doing this because you can see here that one of the data
points is measured in percent, and that's the left y axis, and the other one is
measured in dollars. And the recession marks
might have been turned off even though they're
mentioned here. Again, we see the
source of the data, which is both FRED and Bureau of Labor Statistics
and Census Bureau, FRED being the aggregator
and the visualizer of this. So we want to be careful when we start layering lots of data in that we somehow still have a way to be clear
about what is what. So sometimes what we do
in line graphs like this is instead of putting
the key off to the side, sometimes it's off
to the right side, sometimes as at the bottom, with FRED it's at the top. We might want to think about, would we want to actually
superimpose some text on this line graph right above
the green line that says, "This is the unemployment rate in Charlevoix County Michigan
in percent" so that there's just less places our eyes have to
look to find things. The other thing I want to
point out about line graphs is that data forecasts should be distinct in your visualization
from actual data. So you recall as you've gone
through these Gale reports, the details of this screenshot
are less important than what's in the purple
box, another preattentive
attribute to say here, let's just look at this part. You remember that when
we walked through this data in the
first week of class, as you were trying to figure out what your recommendation
would be, that these demographics
in Gale do 2010 census, 2000 census, 2019 is an estimate because
we're filming this in 2019, and 2024 is the
five-year projection. And you know that when you saw
some of those charts that were pre-made and auto-generated
by DemographicsNow that they visualize 2019 and 2024 just as if they're data that's actually
happened and verified. And that's great because we get that data right away
in visual format, and so we get that speed, and we can instantly run it for any other city or
any other region. But as we move
through the process of communicating with
the visualizations, we want to think about how we make it clear to the viewer that this
data is our best guess. So I'm going to show you two possibilities from the
Brookings Institution. One shows that projected data
is marked in a dotted line. Sometimes it's colored on other visualizations
and sometimes not, and that's just one way of saying this is where we think
it's going to go, this is our best guess. The other way that
sometimes we see it, another Brookings
visualization, you can see that there's
this vertical dotted line, and that everything from
there is a forecast. This I like a little bit less because first I think it looks clunky to write
the word forecast, and secondly, I'd just
rather see one less line. I think that vertical
line is also kind of clunky, and it might be better
to just dot the line, and then we're using less text. And when we have less text
and less visual change, we actually can streamline the process of making
sense of a visualization. The same goes with margin of
error or uncertainty, are particularly important when
we're looking at census data, that's maybe ACS data, where there's that
wide margin of error. Remember the plus sign that
showed up on Census Reporter? When we've got a big
margin of error, we want to make sure
that people are planning for best-case / worst-case
scenario, right? And we used to do this
as drawn on the left. We would make these bars and that would indicate that
at that data point, it could be as high
as this and it could be as low as the
bottom of the bar. And researchers, including
our own Paul Resnick and Eytan Adar, actually did some
research and realized that when people see this before, they actually trust
the trend line more than they did before. So what we really realized was that we thought we were being
helpful, but we weren't. So now what you're seeing in
visualizations is when you have a margin of error or
a level of uncertainty, is we're seeing that people
are actually shading the entire area between what would have been the top
bar and the bottom bar. And that's giving us a
better sense of range. Another way you
could do this is to exercise the idea
of small multiples. You could also do this
as a series of graphs. Predicted outcome, best-case scenario,
worst-case scenario. So they can see three
distinct scenarios. Now you've got a sneak
peak of what we're going to talk about with pie charts. Slopegraphs use
minimal data points and their real goal is
to illustrate a trend. Sometimes it's just
two data points. So this is when the actual
data is less important, but the pattern is what we
want to pull out of things. So here's one example. This is screen or
media use by income, and you can see it's lower
income, medium income, higher income, how many hours and minutes were they spending
on average over time. So we have this weird trend where the numbers went
down a little bit, not by a lot, and
then shot back up, and shot up particularly acutely with lower-income households. So here the point we're trying to make is a pretty blunt one, which is that screen
time is up and it's particularly higher in
lower-income areas. So we actually
don't need a ton of data to make that point. Nice and simple. Again, I could have mapped
this as a line graph in Excel, and I could have pasted it in
PowerPoint and just traced over it with the line
and shapes tools so I only was dealing with the most minimal of information. Now, you do need to be careful whenever you do slopegraphs
that you in eliminating data points or minimizing
data points that you don't accidentally tell
an incorrect story. So here what we can see is
that this is mapping two statements and the degree to which people agree with them. and the top statement in
the light font says we should pay less attention
to problems overseas, and you can see sentiment to
pay less attention goes up, and then it comes back down, and the bottom one has
a reverse trajectory, which is that the number of people who agreed with
that we should be active in world affairs went down and is now headed back up. We would not want
to convert this to a slopegraph because
if we did that, it would show that there's
no change, but in actuality, we do see that there have been significant sentiment
changes over time. So be careful when you try to do slopegraphs that you don't oversimplify to the point of losing the real
value in the data.
