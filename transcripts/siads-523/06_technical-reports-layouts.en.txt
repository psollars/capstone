Let's continue our conversation about
technical reports with some conversation about layout. Now, it's easy to feel like you're
going to get stressed out about doing this. But I want to remind you that while we're
all going to use slide software of one kind or another, you do have lots of
choices for how you approach this. So you can, if you're comfortable
sharing your email address, download Duarte's templates
and just use hers. There are a couple of examples
that you can use from that. Secondly, we've got some
samples that you can use. So all you have to do is figure out
where you want to plug in data and where you want to plug in text. Third, if you like a little bit
more control over the look, you can go to a site that has slide
deck templates like Slidescarnival.com and download templates for free or
import them into Google Slides for free. And that way, you're
choosing the color palette, but you are taking a little
more responsibility for layout. And finally, some of you
come from experiences where you're really comfortable
using Adobe tools. And you'd rather just go off-roading and
use a tool like Adobe Illustrator and design your own. The choice is up to you, the level to
which you want to customize things. I want to emphasize that even though
we are using slide deck software, we are not making
a presentation slide deck. We are tweaking a presentation software
to use it for report writing. So you'll actually be making
two slide decks in this course. In this week, you're going to
be making the technical report. And then when you come out on the other side
next week, we'll talk about visuals for your technical report. When you come out in Week 4,
we'll talk about presentation strategies. So you will find that you
need to adapt for each one. So let's talk about some key goals for
layout if you're choosing to do your own. One critical idea is this
idea of alignment and grids. Robin Williams does a great series of updates to her book
The Non-Designer's Design Book. And in that she talks about how one of the common
mistakes we make as amateur designers. and most of us are amateur designers, is that we let things be
populated all over the page. And we don't really know. We know something's kind of
cluttery about the document but we can't put our fingers on it. And the number one way to
begin to improve your design is to think about having the fewest
number of margins possible. And that means we want to align so
that we have a minimal number of vertical lines in our work and
a minimal number of horizontal lines. This is why centering a lot of times
creates more visual tension than we want because it means our eye is looking
down that jagged center line. Instead, let's lean into using more
left justification so things line up, and turning on grids and rulers in your presentation
software to help you snap to items. Now, Duarte talks about having
a four-by-three grid for your design and that's a good start. We can look at some formats for this and then we'll talk about a few places where
maybe you off-road just a little bit. But her idea is that you always
want to have elements that are hugging one of these lines. So here are a couple of examples and
here I've used blue to represent text and yellow to represent images or
visualizations. So we start by a very simple,
on the top left corner, we've got room for a title or
a subtitle and two big sets of text. Moving down from there,
we see a four-column approach. Top right, we have a large
visualization with a title and maybe a little bit of notes to the side. And in the bottom we have maybe it's
a photo that creates a left column. And we've got three smaller
columns of text and we've sort of hugged
the title down a little bit. Here's three more examples. In the top left corner, we see room for
a title and a subtitle, a large graphic. Maybe it's a map. I often find maps need a lot more
space than other visualizations, especially if I need to annotate them. And underneath would go the caption or
the source material or the organizational info. Below it, let's say you have a page and
it has very little content. You might find that you can
put a decorative stripe or a decorative banner or
even a navigation bar across the top. Maybe you just have a ton of white space
and you just have two columns of text. In the top-right-corner variation on that,
we've moved the title down a little bit from the stripe and
we've put a square-shaped image. There are hundreds of ways that you
can work along the grid, as you saw in the slide deck that you read. Here's some other
strategies that might work. Here we have just a quote on a page. Here we have a Table of Contents where
we might just have two columns, which is the page number in one column and the description of it in the second. And then on the right-hand side,
two versions of three columns. And these sort of break the rules, because these don't necessarily
align perfectly to the grid. But they are equidistant
between each column, and between each column and
the side and bottom margins. Here's a version with an illustration. Here's a version without. So you can use grids if you
start to feel like your design is starting to feel funky. Notice that in a lot of presentation
software, you can click and drag, and little red dotted lines will
pop up to help you line things up. This to me is the number one way
when my design is going wonky to snap things back into place. You also want to think about white space. And this Is really where the tension
between this is what I want to say and this is the room I have to say it
can become challenging. And you may find that you need
to snip out a few words or rework phrases that are wordy
into more succinct ones or turn one page of
content into two pages. Let me show you what
this might look like. So I'm a verbose person by nature, so often my first draft looks
something like this. And everything is lined
up nicely to a grid but there's just no room for the eye to rest. And so it's hard to know
where my eye should go first. Let's take a look at what happens when
I try to aim for more white space. And here, by the way, lots of
designers just use random Latin text so that people when they're looking at
design aren't distracted by the words. They're just looking
at blocks on the page. I decided to try it again. I cut out some words and
I turned this into three columns. And here you can see I've got
more space between the columns, because clustering information helps
us know what goes with what visually. I've made wider margins on the
side and the bottom, and a much larger margin at the top. And you can see how you're probably
responding a little bit more positively to this one versus the other one. This meant I had to cut some of my
beautiful Latin phrases to make it fit and so I may have had to expand this
into two pages, for example. Here's another approach, even less text
where we've got lots of white space. And suddenly it's very easy for
the eye to rest and really take in what that
text is telling us, right? So this is actually my favorite, even if it means I've got to then
continue the text onto a second page. And here they are side by side so
that you can get a sense of them. In many cases, I would go with
version two or version three, but it's just find that
the number of columns and the amount of text really do have
an impact in the way people take in the words that you have remaining. You'll have to do a little
bit of playing around. And this is again why I
like using PowerPoint for that purpose, because it's so
easy to resize images. It's so easy to type in a new column
width and see what it is that I like. You'll also notice that
this is also happening. For those of you who have been in
the scholarly community, you know that we used to see academic posters that
looked a lot like the poster on the left. And we're seeing that even academic
posters are starting to reduce the amount of text and to really forefront
what is really important. So white space is one of those bugaboos
that your desire to communicate and your desire to be understood
can really come into tension. But it can be really worth it to
see the positive impact later. If you have a long report, and your
report is not going to be a long report, then you might want to think about
having some kind of navigation tools or navigation bars, and Duarte
talks about this in her slide deck. So if I were making a slide
deck about the four areas that we are going to look at in a technical
report, I might have color coding by page. So all the pages that have to do
with layout have a dark blue bar and all the ones with color have
a medium blue bar, etc. I could also do this by putting
an underline under whatever topic I was on at the time. I could also do it by graying
out the other colors and just coloring the topic I'm
talking about at one time. Or even graying out just text and
having the navigation. I don't think your reports are going to
be so long that you need this. But these kinds of, "hey, where
in the process of this am I?" can come in really handy with
extended-length reports. That's all we've got for that section. Let's pick up in the next segment.
