Hi, welcome back. Let's talk some about
structure of presentations. So we want to follow a structure where
we're going to have beginning, middle, what in literature we would call
the climax moment, and the end. We're going to think about how our data
conversation could fit into that paradigm because structure is reassuring. People feel good when they
know where they're going and where things might end up. It also really
helps you to plan more efficiently. So if we think about beginning, middle, the climactic moment, and the end, we're
going to think about our presentations for this course as following these
sort of four dramatic moments. So we're going to start with
a kind of introduction. In Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha's case, she tells
the story about Makayla the patient. So she uses an anecdote. There could also be a memorable hook.
If it's a face-to-face presentation, it could be a moment from a YouTube video. Something that pulls people in and says,
this is something that's important and worth listening to. Then in the middle,
we want to unpack the setting. When and where is this data happening? What's going on that's at play at
the time that we're looking at this data? And then we're going to have things that
are characters. Not necessarily literally people, although some storytelling
with data books do talk about having heroes of your data presentation. It might be following
the journey of a person. It might be that you're
going to use personas. So you want to think back to those
Experian Mosaic profiles we looked back at in Week 1. How can they potentially become
characters in your show? Characters can also be issues or
phenomena. So things like inflation might be actually
the leading character in your data. The climactic moment is going to be where
there is what Atkinson talks as imbalance. And this for me means it's the moment
where the tension is at its highest and it's clear that a change of
some kind needs to be made. And from the delineation of that tension
or that need for change comes the end. Atkinson calls them things like
balance, solution, and conclusion. I might use language more like
the recommendation you're going to make, the action steps, and
then somehow bringing the whole presentation to a close with
a memorable moment or a recap or even a return as in the memoir example of
the return of the character of Makayla. And this again is going to
give you a structure and it's going to give your audience
a structure that they can naturally sort of fall
into in your presentation. So some of you remember learning
this in maybe Middle School, this idea of a plot line. And so, when we look at it as
a plot line in literature, we would use these five words for
what's happening. We've got the exposition. That's sort of
the stuff you need to know before the story can really take off plot-wise. There's the rising action. You know, the big crisis in a story
never happens on the first few pages. It takes a while. There may need to be some interactions or
some conversations or some events that all lead up
to this big moment in a story, this sort of showdown at the OK Corral
moment. And from that, rather quickly, we come down to how things are going
to resolve themselves in the story. So falling action might be what happens
as a result of the climactic moment. And then, especially in
traditional literature, they're sort of a nicely
packaged ending to the story. So if we apply this metaphor to
the presentations we're going to get, we might think of our plot line
looking something like this where we've got an introduction,
a short anecdote or hook. We have the rising action where
we're explaining where is this data situated in time and space and
the history of an organization perhaps and whose behavior are we tracking in here? Are we looking at people,
phenomena, ideas? And we're unpacking that world so that
when we set up the moment of imbalance, that moment of tension, that moment
where something needs to be decided, we've already given our listeners or
our viewers the information they need to be with you as you
propose how to resolve that. And once you've revealed that moment
of highest tension or change, then you can propose your
recommendations and your solutions and you can bring things to a close with
your ending or your conclusion. Maybe it's a return back to
the anecdote from the beginning. Maybe it's an extension
of the call to action. And sort of thinking about your
presentation in these beats can be really helpful in how you
add more of a sense of drama or story or narrative to this factual
information that you have. So let's talk a little bit more
about each of these phases. So in the beginning or
the introduction maybe, like Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, you start
by talking about a person or a persona who is someone who's going on
a journey and we're following their data. Maybe it's a story about
one of your customers or one of the players on your team and
you're sort of setting the stage. Maybe you want to talk about a story from
history or literature or current events. Maybe your boss really
loves Harry Potter and you can figure out how to tell a Quidditch
story that will set the stage for how your data has a parallel
experience to that. Maybe it's about just asking the audience
to consider a particular moment in time, which will get them in sort
of the right head space. So maybe you ask them to think
about the happiest time they ever spent with friends that primes them to
carry those emotional things forward. Now if you have 25 minutes or
half an hour to do that, you can spend about five minutes
just on the beginning. Just on telling that story and
sort of warming the crowd up and getting them in the right head space. The challenge for you in this course is that you have five
minutes to do this entire assignment. So this will have to be something pretty
short so that you have time to get to the meat or the middle of this,
of your presentation. Here's one of the strategies that
I sometimes use in the beginning. This is a slide template for a data literacy conference
we had a few years ago. I have like an agenda slide or
a "Today, We Will" slide. So if you are not feeling comfortable with
this sort of anecdote version of beginning your presentation, another way is to
think about it in terms of an agenda. And this can also be helpful because
it again, like awakening an emotional framework, it awakens a sense that
there's a structure in place for your listener or viewer. We also want to think about setting and the major thing we want to
set here is context. What are the circumstances under
which you gathered the data? Was there anything particular
that was experimental data? What was in play? What were the variables? What were you looking for? It helps to know whether you're looking
at current data or historical data or whether you've been making
projections into the future. Help us know where the data sits in time. You might have to establish
where are we talking about. Is this data just for Michigan? Is it data for the Midwest? Is it data that's international? As we move a little bit more
abstractly from a sense of place and time, what are the key issues that are maybe on the company's mind
at the time of this presentation? And sometimes things like
visualizations can help there. Maybe a colored map helps
establish a sense of where we are. Maybe it's a sense of two pie
charts next to each other, showing how things have changed. Maybe it's a trend line on a graph. Then we want to think
about the characters. Now, if you read some storytelling with
data books, this is literally a person. And in the case of the memoir example,
it is a person that she conjures here, but it could also be other things. So I mentioned that things like issues or
phenomena can be the characters. So if you're in New Jersey and you are
looking at data related to Hurricane Sandy and the kinds of weather patterns
you saw before the hurricane arose, your character might be the hurricane or
hurricane behavior. And that is the way in which you are sort
of multidimensionalizing the data off the page. Sometimes you are the main character. Maybe what you're going to unpack is your
process of making hypotheses, testing them with data, running the analysis, checking
your work, seeing if the hypothesis works. And you're literally going to use as
a through line your thinking process. And, as I mentioned before,
it might be a persona. And that's why we looked at that Gale
Business DemographicsNow tool way back in Week 1, is that it helps
us very quickly get a sense of the type of people that live in
the area that you're talking about. And you might be able to use that persona
and their attributes as a way of walking through the data that you've gathered and
the conclusions that you have drawn. So here we have the climax,
or the imbalance, or the tension, which is
anything from what's at stake? What will happen if we take action? What will happen if we
let things stay the same? What will happen if we make a change? Why do we care about this? Why are we here having this meeting and
this conversation? What are we trying to solve? And what might you need to change if you've run data based on
a particular scenario? What particular lever would we
need to flip for that to change? Maybe the question is, why is now
the time to be thinking about the issue? Why are we thinking about outsourcing
now, versus five years ago, versus five years in the future? And again, in some cases, it's that we
see the data pointing in a direction and we see that it's going in
a direction that doesn't feel right, or doesn't feel profitable,
or doesn't feel successful. And so what will be the outcome
if there is no change? And that's the Flint example. If there is no change, and the amount
of lead being absorbed in the human body continues to go up,
there are very dramatic health outcomes that are permanent and
irreversible that can take place. So thinking about if you don't
know what a moment of tension is, or a moment of uncertainty,
or climax, or imbalance, or any of those words, you kind of have to
ask yourself, why do we care about this? Why are we even dealing with this? And sometimes the reality is we don't
care as individuals, but we know that executives care, or boards care, or
people higher up in the pay scale care. So really having a sense of this
goes back to what's your why? This is the moment where we really
want to activate that sense that action is needed for
the people who are listening with us. And finally, we think about the end,
or the balance, or the recommendation. What do we think
the organization should do? What do you think the executives
should decide to do? In many cases, you also want to unpack
why are you not picking the other choice? Because that's a way of
thinking proactively. If we are making a decision, and we are weighing the benefits of putting
apples in school lunches or pears, and our recommendation is apple, what's the
first thing an audience might think about? Well, why not pears? So we might need to set up
a situation where we say, I didn't choose pears for
this because X, Y, and Z. And that lets you be proactive and
anticipate pushback to your idea, and it also helps reassure the audience
that you've thought of everything. And then this is the most important part, the evidence that supports your rationale
that you've been playing out over time. And as part of the end, we also talk
about the solution or the action steps. How are we actually going to take on
the balance or the recommendation? So if the recommendation
is to outsource to China, you might propose in the solution three
things that will start that ball rolling. That you're going to contact a consultant
who hooks up businesses to businesses. Or you might start on
a long-range plan for not hiring new people in those
roles when they retire so that you're thinning out the workforce
naturally as you transition work to China. And finally, at the end, and
remember you've only got five minutes for this in your assignment, if you opened with a scenario or
a persona, it's a nice parallel structure
to come back to it at the end. So you see that in Dr. Hanna-Attish. She comes back to the character
of Makayla at the end to sort of tie a nice bow around things. So she's got sort of this bookmarking
approach where beginning and end have the same character. If it's been a long presentation, it's
often useful to restate the key ideas, to reiterate what the
problem or the need is, and restate the recommendation
and the action steps. For your presentation, you can probably
skip the last two because you won't have time, and because mere minutes will have
passed since you shared those ideas. And in fact, I learned this from
our colleague Paul Edwards, that you want, in the end,
often to have your last slide not just say the word questions, but
to use that real estate. This is often the slide that's up longer
than any other in a presentation. To use this space to talk about
what were those big ideas. And that way,
you've got that visual reinforcement as you are taking questions or
wrapping things up. We also want to talk
a little bit about rhetoric. And many years ago,
when I began to study public speaking, there was a sense that we all should
speak with a very sort of New York Times vocabulary, and
with a rather patrician speaking style. And I would say that,
as we're filming this in late 2019, we're seeing a pretty big
change in rhetoric right now. That we are more interested in using
vocabulary and jargon that the audience will appreciate, as opposed to this
sort of objective, more patrician voice. We know that repetition of
key phrases can be important. Think about speeches like I Have a Dream,
or Barack Obama's Yes, We Can, where the same phrase
gets said over and over. It lets the audience sort of be
in on the game a little bit. So it could be anything from, and
once again, the stock split. And then you explain something else, and
you say, and once again, the stock split. And a little bit later, and
once again, the stock split. Anything that can sort of keep connecting
what you are talking about now to something that's happened earlier. And finally, especially given
the short length of your presentation, you really want to think about precision
of language and economy of language. Knowing how to say ideas in the smallest
number of words and space possible. And the number one way you do that
is to practice and to have a sense of intentionality by plotting
your ideas of how you are being very deliberate and thoughtful
about how you move from idea to idea. So let's talk a little bit
about dealing with bad news. Sometimes data will show that a company
is exactly on the right track and that they need to double
down on something or you need to convince them to keep doing
what they're doing because it's working. And that's a great opportunity. But we are living in complicated times,
and quite often when you talk about data with folks, as in the example that you
read, you're dealing with bad news. And I'm a big fan of the Ask a Manager
blog and what Alison Green on that blog does is she handles the workplace. She's
sort of a Dear Abby of the workplace. And she says often when we have
bad news and we need to talk about it with employees or with bosses,
we sort of hedge our way around them. And we don't actually come out and
say what the issue is. So based on Alison Green and
in honor of Ask a Manager, the first tip I have for
you is to be clear. Oftentimes, one of the challenges of bad
news is we don't actually come out and say what the bad news is. And so that can continue a piece of
ambiguity and a sense of uncertainty. Whereas data will probably
be showing you, and you'll be able to see to what
degree it's showing you, it will point you in one direction or
another. So be clear. If profits are tanking, then don't say, oh I don't know
if sales are down a little bit. You need to just be clear
about naming that behavior. So we call this minimizing
opportunities for people to read ambiguity into
something that isn't ambiguous. If you see that there's an opportunity
to reverse course and to change that, bring that up sooner rather than later. So that you don't just keep talking
about what's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong, and your audience
is getting more and more downhearted and more and more of
a sense that this is a hopeless situation. So when you're storytelling,
thinking about we've got this bad data,
but I have a solution. Here's the bad data, but you don't feel so bad about it because you feel secure that
we've got a good option coming their way. Also with bad news,
especially if the news is surprising, you want to allow time for people to think
about the news that you've just given. So you don't want to assume that they
can come up with an action plan or a strategy immediately. But again, this is where you
articulating what you think the recommendation would be is so helpful. And I know for some of you you're
thinking like your job is going to be to do analysis and not decision-making. Sometimes the shift into
decision-making comes as you move up the hierarchy in an organization. But also it can be an act of kindness to
busy executives after you've said the data is showing this isn't going the way we
want, here's an idea for how to fix that. That gives them either something
to adopt or push back on. Both of which are less
cognitively stressful than having to figure their
own way out of things. So also you don't need to sugarcoat it.
You don't need to ornament it. You don't need to say I know
you feel bad about this. You don't need to overtalk about it. You just need to be clear and
succinct and non-emotional. Don't try to anticipate
how they'll respond. And often, I will say this is my
own instinct, I often think, well, maybe if I tell a joke it will
lighten the room, and it doesn't. So just stay away from making jokes or making light of the situation.
Bad news is bad news. I also want you to think
a little bit about flow. So you may know of the theories
of Csikszentmihalyi, which talks about how when we are really
doing something that we are really into, we have this sort of sense of flow. And flow also can help us connect
the dots in our structure and make constellations out of our stars. So maybe that means that you play
with the order in which you reveal certain pieces of data. So imagine a scenario where you
are talking through your data analysis and you say, first we started by
looking at median household income, and that led us to ask about home values. And so we took a look at that and
we noticed that they were kind of moving in sync, and then we realized maybe
we should look at commuting distance. And so we're following linearly in
the same order in which the events happened, versus thinking you
could show the ending first. You could say, so
this is where we are today. This is data from
last week's dashboards. What's interesting to
me is how we got there. Let's go back in time and look at
the data that led us to this point. And when you're thinking about sequencing,
you can also think about it in terms of which data points do I want to raise
first to set the stage for others? Do I want to put the most
explosive bit of data first? Do I want to save it to the end,
as the grand finale? What's the order and the priority in which
this data is going to unfold for us? So two things that can
happen as ways to help you. Some people literally
storyboard their presentation. They sort of sketch out the words or sort of the emotions or the actions that
they want to communicate in various times. So here's a Tom Ray example.
Some people use sticky notes. This is actually from
the Storytelling with Data blog. So it comes from your textbook
author where she starts by moving in a pretty linear way
through her presentation, and what she's showing you with the blue
arrow was that she's playing with moving the recommendation up to the very
beginning of the presentation. So what she, let's play with
what each of those would do. So imagine the blue is gone.
If we work linearly, you're helping people see your
thinking process over time. And hopefully the recommendation
comes as a natural extension of that thinking process. That's going to be right for
some audiences. If we flip it and we do
the recommendation first, then what you're saying is, hey guys,
I've got this under control. This is what I think we should do. Now I want to give you some evidence
to back up that recommendation. But I've gotten the most important
thing out there right away. And by the time I finish, I'm going to
have gone through all the rationales that you would ask me about otherwise, so
that you're convinced by the end. Some people use slide sorter
in slide presentation tools. I do this a lot where I just start
putting an idea on a slide and then I move them around as I go. The one thing that can be hard about this,
it looks easier and cleaner and more polished to do this
than to do pen and paper. But sometimes this does not give me
the through line that I'm looking for. And so oftentimes if I start in a slide
sorter model, I actually end up going back to paper or to sticky notes when I start
to feel that through line is weakening. One of these recommendations from your
textbook is the idea of vertical logic, which means that you've got all
the same idea on each slide. So your header of your slide
matches the visualization of your slide if you've got one, and all of the bullet points match that slide. Now, let's take a look at
a horizontal logical approach, which is that the main ideas
from your agenda slide or your Today We Will slide should match
the headers on the following slides. So two quick things you can do when you're
at the point of making slides to get yourself to that point.
