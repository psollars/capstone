You might be thinking what if I'm just not warm person. What if I'm just not
a great presenter. What if I talk to my grandma
and she tells me I'm boring? Then let's think about some other more practical strategies that you can employ. So one thing to be
thoughtful about is speed. And this one of my
challenges as a speaker. So if I'm talking like this
about this presentation, you get a sense that
maybe I'm pretty nervous and now you're
pretty nervous, and then pretty soon,
we're all nervous. But if I slow down, and I'm able to be more
methodical about what I'm saying, that instills a
sense of comfort and authority and a sense
that I am a more, a reliable, objective
type of person. So really think
about slowing down. Putting a deep breath when you change your slides
will really help. And moving as
methodically as you can. And again, the more
prepared you are, the easier it's going to be to keep that pace at
a pleasant rate. Next, you want to
think about pitch. So like it or not, high-pitched voices are still not afforded the same level of respect as lower-pitched voices. So you may want to think
about how you vary your pitch as a way to
establish that sense of warmth. Anything you can do, you know how your mouth
sort of opens up when you yawn and you can feel your upper palate, that top part of your
mouth, kind of come up and your lower jaw
kind of sinks down? That makes a bigger place
for the sound to resonate. And when you can do that, when you can trick your mouth
into working like that, then you can take your tone
and your pitch down a bit. And again, that can
help give a sense of calm authority that
can be helpful. Now, as naturally
high-pitched person, I also struggle with this, but I can tell you
that the way in which a lower pitch and a slower speed settle me down and make me feel more comfortable
about public speaking, it's a really noticeable thing. So those are other ways that
you can warm things up. And finally, we are lucky
to be living in a period where authenticity
is really prized. So what you see on your screen is a Kurt Vonnegut set of
advice for how to write. And I think that this also applies to how we think about webinars. First, to the maximum extent you can, care about what
you're presenting about. So Mona Hanna-Attisha deeply
cares about Flint kids, so she presents in a way
that signals that care. And if care isn't the right word for you,
think about invested. How can you show that you're invested or committed
to this topic? His second rule is don't ramble. And we've talked about that how important it is to practice and get your story down so that you're saying what
you mean to say. Keep it simple. Simple vocabulary, simple
visualization styles. They represent complex ideas, but the tools you use are easily understood and require
less cognitive load. Next, have the guts to cut. One of the things that
might frustrate you about this assignment is that you
had a multi-page report, and now we're going
to ask you to squish that into five minutes. Which means you're going to
have to make some choices about what the highest
impact information is, what the best way to
communicate something is. We've set this time limit
to be so short on purpose, because short presentations
are harder to pull off and require much more planning and strategy, whereas longer
ones let us run on. Next, sound like yourself. Don't try so hard to sound like what other people think
you should sound like. Clearly, there are probably implicit signals you
get at work about what the extremes of language
are in your organization, but try to sound
as much as you can like your professional self, so that you at least
aren't putting on a role when you present. And that will lower your anxiety
and that will translate into your online presentation. Next, we saw this advice
earlier when we were talking about Ask a Manager and
delivering bad news. Say what you mean to say, which is that you are direct and clear in the way
that you express things. And finally, he says
pity the readers. They are the ones who have
to go through what you've gone through and
that fits this idea of empathy that
we've talked about, that our goal is to inspire
action in other people. It's not to show
how amazing we are. So pity the listeners
or the viewers is thinking about
what do other people need to know in order
to be able to take in my recommendation and the action steps that
I've recommended, and how can I be as good a
presenter to them as possible? And that paradigm shift of
thinking about viewer first is really critical to this being an
effective format for you. I also want to pause for a
moment before we go on to the next concept and talk
for a moment to introverts. So if you are someone who considers yourself an introvert, and I consider
myself an introvert, the idea of public
speaking can be really scary and intimidating. But one of the things I've
learned over years of teaching these strategies to our
residential Master students is that often introverts
are the best at establishing a really
lovely environment for which to share their ideas, because there's room
for their perception, for them to not
have to perform to the degree you would
if you had to project your voice in a big meeting room. And so one of the things that
happens every year with our residential students
is that somebody who maybe hasn't shined in another public
speaking environment really does an amazing job here. So trust that that
sort of intimate sense that you can build
as an introvert will really pay off
for you in this format. Now before we go, we want to talk about a couple of other things beyond
warming up the room. We took a long journey
into warming up the room. I want to talk briefly
about accessibility, and by that we mean that we want to create an
environment that is equitable for all
listeners and viewers. So here's one thing
that is really helpful. Oftentimes, if I'm looking at you and you say a word
that I don't know, I can sort of figure
out from the context or from your facial expression
or from your body language what it might mean. But keep in mind that again, you might not be seeing
the person who's talking. So one of the things you
can do to be accessible to people is if you're going to use terms that you know
are unfamiliar, you post them on screen. So if I say the word ersatz, you don't even maybe know how to Google that word. Maybe you do. But if I put it up here, suddenly it makes a little
bit more sense, right? You maybe have seen that
word in print before. So ersatz mean sort of a
fake version of things. Also, keep in mind that increased font size
does help everyone. It helps those who have older eyes and those whose
eyesight isn't tremendous. And also, it by limiting
the amount of text that can be on
the screen at once, you also help folks who have slower reading time or
slower processing time. So don't be afraid to go a little bit more
bold with your font. Finally, you may find, especially if you have data that you have visualized data and you're working with someone
who is vision impaired, make sure you use the
alt-text version of PowerPoint to write in a description
of what you see. What you want to do is you want to describe it in a way that people
will understand the meaning of the visualization. So it's better to say
a visualization showing that Michigan's roads are getting
worse over time is better than
saying it's a pie chart, one part's blue,
one part's orange. And on the left, it's this.
These are the percentages. And on the right, it's
those percentages. Those are a lot of details, but
they don't  communicate that main idea. And so thinking about your visualizations and giving them some alt-text so that they can be read by machine
readers if necessary, also helps you know why you've included that visualization
in the first place. If you can't explain what's
important about it, maybe it doesn't belong there. Another thing you might think about is if you're in an  organization where there are employees
who are hearing impaired, is that you may wish
to use your video camera to have the sign language
interpreter being on screen. That's the ideal
way we can do it. If that is not something that you're
able to do, and first, make sure you check
with your HR folks about accommodations. Webinars and online presentations are a little bit behind the curve when it comes to Americans
with Disabilities Act. Another option is that you can use one of the
tools on your screen. Voicea, Otter, and Zoom are all tools that have voice
transcription built into them. And so if you cannot provide other means for folks to access the content like a sign
language interpreter, one option may be, and
again check with HR, to use one of these
tools to help you build an automatic transcript
of what you've done. And then you can post the
finished video with the transcript and then
everybody can access everything. So even though these tools may require that you need to do
a little bit of clean up, especially if you are
using a lot of terms of art or industry-specific jargon, the machine conversions
aren't always amazing. But they usually
can be made within an hour of things being done. Another option is that you
have one of those tools, make the recording, but
you don't clean it up. And when you share
the recording, you say there's an option
to have a transcript prepared and you prepare it
and you clean it up on demand. All right, hopefully
those strategies will help you be a more
confident presenter. In the next section,
we'll talk about participation and
question and answer.
