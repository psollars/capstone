Welcome back. We're continuing our conversation
about design considerations. Now let's talk a little
bit about aesthetics. So here we're going to really think
about color, line, and font style. Now, what's your first impression
when you see this slide? If you've been in Ann Arbor a long time,
you can't help but think that there's something about
this graphic that's got to be about the University of Michigan because
those are the school colors. And so you can see how color
can lend meaning even when, if you just look at the text, we're not talking about anything that has
to relate to the University of Michigan. So we want to be really careful because
color can really be an influencer in ways that if we're not thoughtful
about it can be unexpected or can generate meanings and
provoke memories that we didn't expect. And that's also the three things that
we want to think about when we think about color. We want to
think about hierarchy. Sometimes we use things like shading to
show how much of something there is and how that relates to other data. We can use color to highlight
distinctions, right? So there's this sense that whatever is in
the blue stripe must be more important because it looks different. And color
does awaken our emotions and memories. This is a really intriguing thing because
as we are continuing to be a global economy, we realize that colors
can provoke different emotions and different memories depending on the
cultural traditions in which we grew up. So here's an example of using color
to illustrate levels of severity. This was a project in Detroit where
they literally opened the car windows, stuck an iPad out the window, and took photos of every home in Detroit
to measure the level of blight. And we do get a sense here that
certain areas have much less blight than others and
we can tell that because the more acute the problem is,
the darker the color image is. Here is another example of the same
thing where you can see that the level of health is healthier when the color
is light than when it is dark. This is a really fascinating one,
because this actually came out of Columbia Journalism Review and it got a lot of
press when this report came out and so you can see this image carrying
over into lots of other sites. And in fact, it does not any more appear
on the Columbia Journalism Review site. But let's think about what
is being talked about here. So we've got this sort of
desert color palette and that kind of makes sense because they're
thinking about the idea that there are places where there
are no local news outlets. And those are referred to as news
deserts, just as we talk about things like food deserts being places
where there aren't any grocery stores. What's intriguing about this one
is you definitely get a sense of something is darker and
something is lighter and we associate this sort of
rusty color with deserts. But this was a case where
the darkness of the color meant that it was a healthier media market. In this case, there was sort of
a confusion about color. And so if the headline says news deserts
and all of Florida looks dark orange or much of Florida looks dark orange,
we can think, oh gosh, there's just a real
media crisis in Florida, because we are used to thinking that the
deeper color means more of something. And so this is actually,
maybe could be better called America's metropolitan areas still
have more news, right? So we see a little bit of a disconnect
between the headline and the color scheme. And here's an explanation of that with
some extra information out there. And you can also see that there is a key down
here and visualizers are sometimes into let's label things right
on the visualization and sometimes they're about having a key. In general with maps,
we do still have a separate key, but we're moving away from that with
other forms of visualization. And really what we see here too is that
there isn't much gradation between things. You either have no data or
you have zero news outlets or you have one or you have more than one. So in an area like Southeastern Michigan,
there might be four newspapers and there's no way to tell whether
there's competition in any of these. So they've made a color choice here that
only gives us a very small amount of data. And that requires then that we
have to do a lot more reading of the surrounding text to
get that comprehension. And yet what remains, what is our
biggest kind of sort of boom moment of this visualization, it's that color. It's the color that is
the first thing to communicate. So we want to be really careful about
when we wield the sword of color. And think about the colors that we associate
in the United States with various things. When we see pink and blue next to each
other, we tend to think of gender. Blue and red tends to be
Democrats and Republicans. We use green to show how things
are environmental in nature. So we think about BP Gasoline is
green in its logos, which subliminally makes us think that it is
an environmentally wonderful company. Black and red often
indicates profit and loss. This very clear bright blue color
is that default Microsoft color. Remember when Microsoft Movie Maker came
out and we all had title slides that were this color blue and you knew immediately
what software it was made out of? And thinking about pastel colors like
yellow can evoke a sense of springtime. So you want to be thoughtful when you
pick colors that you are considering not only the design standards and the brand standards that we
talked about in Week 2, but also the fact that colors subliminally
translate into emotion for us. So I think we showed this
example earlier in the sequence. And we talked about this was a really good
example of when just giving the number is the best way to visualize something. Because what we want to know is, wow,
there've been a big increase in robocalls. And this was actually one of the first
graphics I stuck in the slide deck for this course. And so as the course developed and
I was flipping through slides a lot, I would run into this slide all the time.
And every time I ran into it, I thought McDonald's, because these
are the colors of the golden arches and I don't associate this yellow
color with The Economist. Red, yes, but not the yellow. And so I've been kind of surprised
at how I've had this knee-jerk reaction to color that's
completely not intended, right? And think about you'd probably rather eat
at the restaurant that has this green logo that has healthy dining than this
brown earthy color for healthy dining. You get the sense that maybe the food with
the green logo's going to taste a little better, a little bit less like earth. And here is an example of visualizing
how people spend wedding budgets and what can we determine from the color
scheme is that this is sort of a female matter because it's colored
in very female sorts of colors. So there's this sense of who
is this data important for by the way that it's been colored. Also remember that the Storytelling
with Data book talks about how lack of color can help
less important data recede. In fact, the author, remember, talks about
how she when she's not sure what to do, she grays out everything and
then slowly brings back color, and that's part of how she keeps that
sort of monochromatic palette where she really uses white,
dark-gray, gray, and a series of blue colors which
helps her with her brand identity. So here is we've seen this graphic before
and you can see that if what we want to have stand out is the fact that Wisconsin
isn't changing, we've made that stand out. In this case, we've done it
both with the line weight and the weight of the balls at the ends of
the lines, but also with the color. We also know that the major
university in Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin,
has red as its colors. So it's a nice sort of coherent message. We expect these things to move together. And I mentioned this
a little bit longer ago, just remember that color can mean
something different in different cultures and different colors can have specific
meanings within an organization. They aren't called pink slips for nothing. So you want to just be aware as you're thinking about how
you pull things together, are there colors that will give off
a message that perhaps you didn't intend? So it's a good aesthetic choice, but
it's not a good communication choice. So here's a comparison. These are both sort of nonsense data that
were generated out of plain old Microsoft. On the top, we see this sort
of mixed vegetables sort of colors that to me always say Microsoft. And on the bottom, we have
much more like the textbook. We've got those gradations of color so that things look a little bit
more relaxed and more refined. If I worked for a circus company, or
I'm trying to show elementary school data, I might prefer the top one, right? So things look fun and light. But if I'm
working for a really serious boss and there's no playing around, I might
choose this more muted color palette. Also, keep in mind
things like line weight. So here we've got
a couple of things going on. We definitely see that one of
the lines is thicker than the other. The Series 1 line looks really thick,
the one that's sort of shaped like a check mark, but at the same time
it's a lighter color. And so this is giving off
sort of a mixed message. Are the darker color ones more important
than the one with the heavier line weight? There's a bit of a visual
dissonance that goes on. So you really want to step back and
think about, are my colors or even my hues giving
off a confusing message? And this is particularly important if
you're in an environment where you might create something in color, but you might have it end up being
printed on a black-and-white printer. And Eytan talked about that in
the beginning data visualization course that you've already taken. This is a case where you
might go back and change the color scheme
to add more clarity. I just want to repeat some things from that beginning data visualization
course to think about. One is to check your
visualizations with a black-and-white printer. Make sure that
the differences between colors are as strong as you intend them to be, and
if you're doing a series of gradations that each gradation looks distinct
when you print in black and white. And again, we've talked about
accessibility before. You want to think about using a site like Vischeck or
Color Oracle to help assess whether or not something can be read by someone who
is red-green color blind, for example. So you'll want to take a look at those as
you work through your own examples. I also want to return to this
idea of text for context. Our instinct when we first start
can be strip everything away. And sometimes there
are cases where what we really want to do is use
text to add clarification. So there's always a bit of push me
pull you that in general minimalism is appealing, but clarity and comprehension
is always the predominant concern. So what I want to do now is I
want to take a look at an animated visualization from the Detroit Free Press. And as a prelude to that, you know,
Detroit has some unusual history to it. And one of its scarier
moments is that when it got its first African-American mayor, there are many people who
attributed the downfall of Detroit to that mayor. And
his name was Coleman Young. And one of the things I want
you to look at is whether or not people were right
when they said that. So let's go over to the
Free Press and take a look. All right, so here we are
at the graphic and already we see some really
interesting use of labels, right? We see that the names of the mayors
are on the top of the x axis. We could also have put them
on the bottom. This might be a case though where
knowing the year is helpful, right? So we can see who's in office when. We can also watch the blue revenue line,
surprisingly stable over time, and yet what changes dramatically
is the debt line. And remember what I said about people
blaming the poor economy on Coleman Young and you can see actually during his tenure
is exactly when that debt goes down. So if we didn't have this labeled by
mayor's names, we might not realize that. So here's a case where they're
layering in extra text, but you really think to yourself, there's
nothing here that we don't need, right? And so that's a case
where being a little bit extra verbose communicates something
that otherwise wouldn't be there. We could strip this out so
it was just x axis, y axis, take out all the shading, take out the
mayor's names, take out the labels, but it wouldn't be as compelling of a story. So there really is not a firm and true algorithm we can apply when
we're making visualizations. It's going to depend on where
the visualization is being used, whether you are there to narrate and
accompany that information orally or with paragraph text, and what
your prior knowledge of your audience might be including, in this case,
the misconceptions, right? So that's why it's one of my favorite
examples because there's lots to be gained by adding more here
instead of taking away, which is what we've been
doing the rest of the time. So as you can see, different colors and different layers of text
can make a difference. You also saw how as we moved
from one font style to another, certain things jumped out at you more and
certain things receded to you more. All decisions that you'll have to make
as you take the driver's seat in designing visualizations. See you in the next segment.
