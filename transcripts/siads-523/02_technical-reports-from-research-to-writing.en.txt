Welcome back. I
want to continue by talking about how
we actually move from research to writing
in case this is helpful for some of you for whom
this is a new kind of work. For many of you, this
may be a review. Let's say I've been
moving through the data, and I'm going to take a break
from Kendall County and Frederick County because
I actually want to do this data about
my own community. So this is out of
DemographicsNow. It's some Simmons research. It's the Simmons
entertainment, leisure, and dining summary report pulled for the city of Ann
Arbor writ large. And what I like about a lot
of this Simmons data is that I get these statements and I get a sense of agreement. Now, you know DemographicsNow
loves to show you this index data where they say the average American
score is 100. And so scores higher than 100
means that this is a trait or a belief that's more pronounced among the population
being surveyed, and less than 100
means less valuable. And one of the things that
hit me was actually cases where it was surprising
how average American my own community was.
I thought I'm going to look at both health and dining
in my research, and there are two
different Simmons reports. There is also a
lifestyle Simmons report as well as this one on dining. And I decided what I would do. I am still a printout
kind of person, so I would print
this out and I would highlight some things
that felt important. And I kind of went back and forth on which of these I wanted to include and this is
kind of where I settled. I was really looking for what
here indicates that a fast, casual, healthy approach
to dining might be useful. And so I saw that calorically, it's about the same, but people like to
know about ingredients and they try to eat a well-balanced diet and they
try to eat healthier food. I eliminated from consideration
this one near the bottom of "think fast food is all junk" because I think that
the term fast food is changing a little bit and
there's a difference between sort of a
McDonald's class of restaurant and, say, a Panera
class of restaurant, and I'm putting
Chicken Kitchen more in the Panera category. So I sort of marked some
things that I thought might be useful to have. I also went to Yelp
and I wanted to know what kinds of existing peer
businesses there were. So I scrolled through those
results and I have to say I did not realize there were five Paneras in the
city of Ann Arbor, which has 120,000 people. And I actually thought
that was a pretty exciting piece of data, even though it came from a source that doesn't feel
like it would be a serious data source,
because that tells me that not only are there multiple neighborhoods
where dining is featured. Ann Arbor's a loop, and so there are some things
that are inside the loop, and that's where Campus
and downtown are, and then the expressways sort of get
us more towards the suburbs. But I also noticed
there were five McDonald's and that
gave me a sense that no matter how healthy
people think they are, there's still five McDonald's. And that there were a couple
of Qdobas and Chipotles, both of which are sort of trying to
do that fast casual approach, they're using
healthier ingredients, there's vegetarian options there. And all of that felt
compatible with how I saw Chicken Kitchen. You might find additional ones. I've left off this
list, for example, restaurants that don't
have a national footprint just so that there would
be the most understanding among the majority of our class. Here's some screen grabs from another report I found in Gale
Business DemographicsNow. And this is really why just
digging in and keeping an open mind and looking through the options that
DemographicsNow offers you can be so useful, because
you'll find things, little nuggets hidden
in lots of places. And this for me was one of the really prime pieces
of information I found. So I've pulled a snippet
of the 2019 estimates of food budgets and also, below,
the 2024 projections. And what you'll notice that's so interesting about the
city of Ann Arbor, this made me so
happy that I was focusing on my own community, is that the amount of
household money that goes towards eating at home is almost identical to the
amount of money being spent on food away from
home or dining out. And that is actually going
to stay about the same. They are estimating
a slight uptick in people eating food at home. And this really is where I started to see things
come into focus. So that earlier sentiment data didn't seem to have as
many amazing things in it, but now I really see
this is a lot of money. And I went back and I
looked at what is the median household
size for Ann Arbor. I went back to that early Census
Reporter visualization of the census data and I saw this is for households
where the median size is 2.4. This is a lot of money going towards eating
out every year. And this is where I started
to get excited and think, now I'm starting to
understand that this really is a good potential restaurant
for this community. I also looked at this consumer expenditure food grocery details summary report, and I also saw that there was a breakdown that there
is more money being spent for dinner than for lunch. And that also spoke well. I didn't pay much
attention to breakfast, but you might find, let's say you pick up
this scenario to do. This data would show
me, for example, that being open for
breakfast might not be as profitable an option. That maybe just being
open for lunch and dinner in this community
would make more sense. I also played around
a little bit. This is a website called
localconditions.com, and what it will show you
as realtime travel data. So one of the things
that I figured out by looking at Yelp is
where various types of restaurants are relative to
where the major roads are. And this was taken at
nine in the morning. Lots of the campus
offices open at eight, and the university is a
major employer in our city. So what's really interesting is where the traffic slowdown was. It was on this eastern
part of the community. But I also wanted
to look at this and I could go back and sadly, this site only
works in real time. So if you decide you're going to use this in your research, you actually have
to look at it at various times of the day. It does show accidents. Those are the red dots. And that's probably why
we're seeing so much traffic concentrated on the northeast
side at this time of day. I kind of wanted to get a sense of
how is traffic moving at various times of the day and would that give me any insight about where to locate
various restaurants. So I've looked at data in a couple of sources and now I'm to the point
where I want to ask, so what conclusions can we draw? And one of the things that I think is kind of interesting here
is that Ann Arborites really say that they want to be healthy, and
yet they eat out a lot. And that tells me that maybe
the lifestyle data is a little bit aspirational because when it comes
to raw dollars, people are eating out
a lot, and in general, eating out is not quite as
healthy as eating at home. So I thought about how I might
want to talk about that. So I might quote
some Simmons data. I really think the big
data here is the amount of money that's being spent
eating in versus eating out. So I feel like that is really a cornerstone piece
of information. And I'm going to do one
more level of analysis here to say if I
divide that by month, it's about $300 per month
per household or $75 a week. That, combined with the
household size when I dipped back into
census data, is giving me a sense that actually this is a good price point
for this community. I also might use some Yelp data to talk
about how there are these competitors and
how many of them there are in what is really a small city. It really strikes me that
there's so much Panera. And actually anecdotally
one of the Paneras actually has one of the highest volumes in the whole state. So I guess we are all
about Panera in Ann Arbor. And so now I want to think about what's important to talk about, I might play with
the order of this. I've also eliminated a lot of other information, right? I might have looked at
other dining data. I looked at information
about alcohol consumption, for example, that I'm not
going to count as useful. So now I'm really ready
to build that argument. And here's how I end up conceptualizing it. So here's how I started
writing that out. First, you'll notice
I'm not going to bury the lead here, as
journalists would say. Right off the top, I'm going
to tell you I think that people are well suited to this. Then I'm going to move
into a little bit of data. I'm going to explain what an index does by
talking about this 100, and I'm going to talk about
that they really like to eat healthy and they like to know the ingredients in things. I'm going to be honest
that some of the Simmons data is kind of average. I'm going to keep going. I'm going to contextualize what I think about the number
of competitors. You know, you could take this
in a different way, right? We are making human
judgments here. We could say there
are already a ton of fast casual places or upscale fast food
restaurants in Ann Arbor. We don't need another one. Instead, I take this to
say that there's lots of thriving competitors and that means it's fertile soil for us, so using these other competitors
kind of as a test case. So we mention
Panera and the fact that it emphasizes
clean ingredients. And I bring up that detail
because it goes back to that Simmons data in
the previous paragraph. And I talk about too why I picked Qdoba and Chipotle
because both of them have been very
forthright about talking about healthy
ingredients as well. And just in case people think, oh, actually I also
want to know about lower-cost fast food
to see if people like fast food as a big market which includes fast casual
and more budget options, that's why I mention
the five McDonald's as well, as a way of sort of
balancing out that price point. I've talked a little
bit about there are lots of of peers that have found a home here and people say they like
healthier choices here. Now, I'm going to really tell you what I think is important, which is that the dining and eating out budgets
are almost identical. I'm going to mention
that the projections show that this trend is likely to continue when I look at that
five-year estimate. And then I'm going to provide
that actual extra context of how much that equals per
month and how much per week. And I want to draw your
attention here to how I've cited this data. Oftentimes, people think if I get the data from Census Reporter, I should cite Census
Reporter as the source, but remember that Census Reporter is only visualizing census data, so this is a nicer
way to cite that. And you'll notice in the
top of the paragraph that I didn't use an
in-text citation, but it's clear from the
context what source I've used. So because we're not doing formally scholarly
writing, in both cases, I know where did the data come from and when was
the data collected. Sometimes it's in an endnote, sometimes it's just
explained in the text, and that's fine for this
kind of writing. And finally, I'm going to
end with this conclusion which is that we've got
a great price point, we've got these good ingredients that will appeal
to this community, and now I can make the argument wallets and dietary preferences are lined up, this is a fruitful city to
consider for our expansion. And when I went to pull
this together, I actually had to make some
snips to make things fit. I had to make some decisions about how many
columns I wanted to have and did I want to include a visualization
on this page? You will need some of your
pages to be illustrated with visualizations,
not necessarily all. I also would have had to
make a decision here about, do I have so much content
that I actually need to turn this into two
slides instead of one? So one option could have been that I put all of the text on one slide and then I do a full-page visualization
on the next page. And you'll notice that I've
put a very faint box around the visualization just so that it stands out a little bit
from the rest of the data. And I'll just forefront the
third week of class for a moment here by talking about how this
visualization was created. This was actually made using a free tool called Datawrapper, which lets you input
data and asks you all the right
questions so that it is well cited and put together. We'll also talk about
other strategies for visualizations, but I wanted to show
that to you as well. You'll also notice here as we're talking about layout and things, and we'll talk more
about color in a minute. One of the big challenges
throughout this course is that Chicken Kitchen has these two weird pink
colors in its logo, and we're trying to carry
those colors through. But man, are those colors
kind of tough on the eye. So you'll notice that we've
been very judicious about where and how we've used
those logo colors here. So as we wrap up this example, I just want to hammer home the idea that we're
not just listing facts and leaving it to the reader to draw
their own conclusions. We need to hear your analysis, and your synthesis,
and how you are guiding us using data, using your analysis, to the conclusions that you
want the reader to adopt. Or as Data Story says, we're moving beyond FYI into identifying your insights
and your actions. And that's one of the
things as you progress as a data scientist
within a corporation, people will be
looking more and more for you not just to do
the number crunching, but for you to be that person that finds
meaning in that data. And I think that is such a critical communication skill
for the future. Next up, let's talk
about fonts and color.
