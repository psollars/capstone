You're also going to want to pull this
Basic Demographic Summary Report chart. And the reason you want to do
that is because it will do some rapidly generated visualizations for you. Now, what you gain in instant insight,
you sometimes lose in beauty. So these these are not
the prettiest visualizations and they may not be in the format you think
they need to be in for your report. So you may find again that you want to
download the report or that you use one of the methods we're going to talk about
in the third week to trace what's here, using PowerPoint or Inkscape so
that you can manually rearrange things. So what I notice here is that what this
does comparing households by income group. Now, this is all estimated or
predicted data. And so you need to know that up front
that if you want the older data, you're going to have to
visualize that yourself. But what I think stands out here is
that high income group is growing and everybody else is sort of
predicted to stay the same. This one is rarely useful for me, and you'll see it does some
other visualizations. Now you're going to
learn in Week 3, and you've already been learning
in your other course work, that we can do better than this in our design,
and we will show you some strategies. Again, there's some others that you
might look at. You know how to translate these. But again, not great colors,
not necessarily in the format you want, and not maybe able to meet
the learning objectives. So you took the beginning data
visualization course. Eytan believes that every visualization should have a learning
objective and you should be able to answer, what do I want people to
get out of this visualization? But these are a really great start
for some instant data. Al right. Now let's take a look
at some consumer data. This is a real strength of
DemographicsNow is that it can tell us a whole lot about how people
behave in various environments. So I'm going to close a couple tabs
out and I'll meet you over there. Now let's take a look
at some Simmons data. This is going to give us just a brief
overview about some demographics and some information that they've gleaned
around the country about lifestyle. And we're going to go,
still in the summary section, we're going to go to
Simmons Lifestyle Demography. And we've already run the report below. And here you want to be really
careful to look at what is the data that we're talking about. Here we only get access to 2019,
so this is estimated. We get some of that same
census data we got before. And then we start to get
into these indices, and DemographicsNow loves indices. And in general you want to think that
that a score of a hundred is sort of the typical American, and
any score that is lower than that, the lower the number, the less pronounced
that feature is in that community. And any number over a hundred
is more pronounced and shows up more in this
study community. And remember, our community has
been set to Kendall County. So I'm not going to go
through everything, but let's just take a look
at what is in here. So they're above average
to be expecting a baby. So then again, that speaks to
the birth rate or growth rate. They're a little bit low
overall in children, but they recycle more than other people. It's just amazing the kind
of weird stuff you can find. So here's some information from 2018 and
they're all abbreviated. So how do they dress? They dress
a little bit more conservatively. We know Chicken Kitchen does
better in conservative communities. And here's a similar question
that asks in another way. I like to experiment with new styles,
a little bit less than normal. And we may be able to draw
some inferences from that. And this just goes on and on and on. There's a little streak of
Texas independence in there. Definitely a sense, you know, they're
just like the rest of Americans when it comes to do you do duty or enjoy life. And you can just keep going. Here's a question that pops up in
the middle about eating healthy meals. They're less likely
to say they don't have time. They are more likely to say that
their diet is very healthy. Now what's interesting about Kendall
County as you will learn in doing a Yelp search is that there's a lot of fast
food in their biggest city, but it's not upscale fast food. So look at all this
information about health. We know they like to find ingredients. So the fact that that Chicken Kitchen
sells itself as sort of clean eating, it looks like it would bode well for
this community. And things like cars, I'll let you
figure out the rest on your own. But you can see that there's just tons
of information that helps you start to calibrate who is this community, how do they behave,
and what do they think about food? So that's an index. Let's take a look at another index. This is the consumer expenditure
food beverage and groceries. Again, it's got some basic
demographic data up here. And we start to see some
interesting things. So first of all, they actually spend
more money eating out than eating in. And again, that's a sign that is good for
restaurants, right? And you can see some things
about how much do they per household on average
spend on various things. So Chicken Kitchen doesn't serve alcohol, so we can skip that section. But we would like to know how much
do they spend out on dinner? Oh, about $1,600 a year, that's not bad. Spread out over 50 weeks that's
a decent amount of money. And it looks like breakfast and
brunch are not nearly so popular. So the fact that Chicken Kitchen
doesn't open until 11 a.m, that's perfect, because that's not
going to be a big profit center there. And then they're going to talk about
how much money they spend on all kinds of other things. Like they can actually tell
you that they buy $31 worth of crackers a year on average. I think I personally
spend $31 on crackers. And it just goes on and on. So I'll
let you explore the rest on your own. Another index that you want to look at is
one that's specifically about restaurants. This one's actually not an index,
this is just dollars. Again, we see some of that
same information resorted. Here's just an abbreviated
version of that. So in the next segment,
we're going to take a look at personas. And those are really exciting
consumer profiles that will really make your community
come to life for you. See you in the next segment.
