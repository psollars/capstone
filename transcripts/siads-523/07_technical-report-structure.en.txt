Welcome back. One of the things
we've sort of been dancing around in this
week's lesson so far is what exactly are we going to be looking for
in your technical report? So I want to take a couple of segments to talk
about those details, and everything will also
be in your course shell on the assignment sheet as well. In general, your structure should look like
what's on your screen. You'll want to start
with a title page that describes what it
is that is inside. You'll want a Table of
Contents so people can quickly navigate to the pages
they find most valuable. You'll want that one-page
executive summary that you'll bring
over from Week 1. Now, if in the process of
preparing the full report, you end up changing
your mind, that's fine. We're not going to match your final report up to
the executive summary. So feel free if if your
decision has changed. We want to have that quick
page about methodology. What sources did you use? How did you reach those results? You want to have about five pages of the arguments and
evidence section, and this is where you are saying these are the
patterns we found in the data and so this is what I think is
an important fact, as we looked at earlier
in the slide deck. And in there, you want to have
about three visualizations. Now you might make
these fit right on the contents
pages where you've put the other parts of the
arguments and evidence or they might be an
additional page. Let's say you want to show an extended map and you really need a whole page to show that. But you should have about
five pages of text. And then you want to have one
or two pages about why you did not choose the
other potential site. Then you're going to go back to your executive
summary from Week 1 and you're going to think about the recommended action steps. What comes next, based
on your recommendation? Then you'll have a
short conclusion. And generally, the job
of a conclusion is basically to signal that
the report is over. If you don't have a conclusion
and you just kind of stop writing, it can make people think
that there's a page missing or something is missing. So the conclusion
looks a lot like the executive summary in that it restates the main
points of the report, and to some extent it's there for format only. And finally, you're going to
have some references, and that will be in our last
slide deck for this week. So here's an example
of a title page. It's got your name on it, it's got the date on it, and we have some sense
of what the content is. And we're sticking with this color
scheme that's some pink with the greenish color that we got from the Canva color picker. And here's a sample
Table of Contents, just what page can we
find everything on. Here is that executive summary
page from the first week, and you can see that
those action steps are identified boldly right away. And again, you don't need to have any visualizations on this page. Here's an example of what a methodology page
might look like. Basically, what you want
to think about here is what are the various
places that you looked? Now in this case, your methodology
is pretty simple, right? You looked at a bunch of data sources and you're going
to tell us what they are. If you were, say, applying the contextual
inquiry method that you'll find in another course
in this degree program, then you would talk
about how you did interviews and how you processed and analyzed
that data as well. So basically what you're
doing is you're using this page to sort of
set yourself up as an authority and also to explain how you reached the
conclusions that you did. Then you'll have each
of your fiveish pages in which you have a major
argument for each one. And we walked through this
earlier in this slide deck, so I won't go over it again. Now, the thing we haven't
really talked about is citations and references
and what those look like. And so in the next segment, we'll go on to that.
See you in a minute.
