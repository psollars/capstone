Welcome back as we
continue our exploration of simple data
presentation formats. I want to pause here
and talk about maps. I love maps to
visualize information because we all have a general
sense of where we are. And those of us in Michigan, to all of you who are enrolled students who do not
come to this campus, you are being spared the
Michigan tradition where we hold up our hands and
point to where we're from. This is Ann Arbor, this is the Upper Peninsula. We do need to be
careful though that we use rates when we map
data and not raw numbers. So we want to be able to note the frequency with which
certain phenomena are present when we're mapping
to various states in the US, for example, and I'll show you why we don't want
those raw numbers. So here's some data that
the Huffington Post visualized from the American Library Association and one of the things that the American
Library Association does is it keeps a count of how many book challenges
occur in each calendar year. And Huffington Post took that
data and they mapped it to states and each state is colored by the number of
challenges that it had. So when you look at this, especially if you're
a northerner, your first instinct,
I hate to say it, is Texas must really hate books because it's
got such a dark color. There are a bunch of
complainers in Texas. If we back up and
we think about it, Texas is an enormous state
with an enormous population. So we don't know if they
have 13 challenges over millions of people and
Maine has far fewer people, but fewer challenges, we're not comparing apples to apples. It would be stronger if we did something like three
challenges per million people in one state and two challenges per million
people in another state. So if we're not careful, this can sort of awaken
our instincts in a way that is not
positive and not helpful. So rates tend to work
a little better. The other thing I want to
call out about this chart is, your textbook shows this, it's very common to use
color gradations within a single color to make a really nice cohesive
visualization. You do want to be
careful that each of those segments
is really distinct. You should know by looking at any state here what its value is and not
have to say, like, "Well, that one looks a little
bit lighter than that one, which is a little darker." Again, that's sort of more
cognitive activity than we want to have. So while as a member of the
American Library Association, I was excited to see this visualization when it
first came out years ago, I was disappointed
because I heard so many stories of
misconceptions about the data. And that really plays
out when we look at electoral college
data because what we end up doing is you see these maps that
are all for nothing. It doesn't matter how
people voted in the state, the state either
went red or blue. And it doesn't matter how
many votes they get, what we see is that the size that matters is the geographic
size of the state. So states that have lower
populations, like Montana, but cover an enormous
amount of space, look like man, there's a ton
of votes in there. And the reason I bring this
example up is not so we can debate elections and politics, but because there's so
many interesting ways that people have
been experimenting with how to make this
a more nuanced view. Now, I don't want to say
at all that these are not the electoral results.
Of course they are. This is accurate.
But that there are other ways to tell different
variations of this story. This is one version
that KQED showed us. And what it's trying
to do is it resizes the states according to how many electoral
votes they got. So you can see that California
has swollen way up, but Alaska has gotten
quite a bit tinier. And you can also see that they're
on a color continuum from redder to bluer, and that gives us a sense of the ratio
of votes in each state. So here's one way that
we could do that. If you actually go to
the Wikipedia page for the 2016
presidential election, you see all these other versions. So I won't mention them all, but one of the things
you see is people breaking down the
size of population. Here they're looking more at
votes than electoral votes. So one way they do it is if
you look at the top row, this one up here, number two, you see that they've receded those electoral state
mapping colors, instead of bright red,
they're now faded red. They've kind of gone into
the background. So we get all the data
from the previous one, but then they add these
pie charts that show the percentage of votes in each community that
went red or blue. That's one way to think about it. This way adds by trying to put the number of
votes in each state, and this one tries to look at smaller reporting areas
to try to tell the story, not of how a whole
state votes as a block, but how various people
within states vote. And there's others here
that I encourage you to explore on your own time. It's always good to know as
well that there are often multiple people
grappling with how to communicate similar concepts, and to know that they're still exploring as well,
just as we are. All right guys, we've
made it through all of the presentation formats. Next up, we're going to
start rolling up our sleeves and getting our hands
dirty with data design.
