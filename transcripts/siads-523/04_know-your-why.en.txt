Hopefully, that reading
was helpful in helping you get inside the mind of a presenter who is
both a master of the content and the data
that she's talking about, and also is aware
of how emotion and story and personas can help tell that story
more powerfully. And I hope you felt that sense of
beginning, middle, and end, or maybe you saw it more as central content that's
bookmarked on either end. And so we think about
beginning, middle, and end as a way of trying
to create something that's more cohesive across
the presentation, that it's part of an overall arc, instead of thinking
one slide at a time. So the first thing
that I want you to think about as you go through this, and you hear this in Dr. Hanna-Attisha's thinking,
is knowing why. One of the things
that she's really known for is that she is absolutely committed to the
health of children in Flint. She knows her why. So she knows who
she's pitching to, what she wants to get
from those folks, why it's important to intercede in what's currently happening with the
Flint water crisis. She's thoughtful about what the decision-maker
needs to know, and she does that in two ways. She uses the
scientific discussion of the data and she uses this emotional argument about the composite patient
that she's talking about. She's thinking about
what's going to get them to agree with her. So what do they value? What metaphors or
arguments appeal to them? So many years ago, I worked in an elementary school and I had a principal who, more than anything, wanted a
happy community of learners. So I knew that the way to get the principal
to be excited about the work that I was doing was to make sure that I talked
about things like community, and happiness, and
engagement, and teamwork. Those were the sorts of arguments that would work for him. But arguments like
intellectual rigor and problem solving
and critical thinking, while he intellectually
knew those were important, they would not wake up
his heart in the way that those more socio-emotional
factors took place. And that's going to be true in
every case you think about is that when you
are presenting to someone with higher
authority to you, we're going stick with that idea of presenting to an executive. How do they like to
process the world? Do they use sports metaphors? And finally, we want to think
here about moving beyond let me tell you the
facts or informing to how do I make them more
actively involved in the ideas and how do I activate
them to make a decision? She wants the mayor to
stand with the hospital. So one of the things that you
notice when you're reading that memoir chapter is that this presenter has an extraordinarily
strong sense of why. She knows answers to questions like the
ones on your screen. She knows who she is pitching to, why this is so
important and urgent, and what she believes they need to know
to make a decision. And she actually thinks
about it in two ways. One section is very much about scientific content and
scientific knowledge, and the other part is
really much more about how to make an emotional
plea and an emotional case, that this is about children, that this is about individuals. It isn't just about
chemicals in water, that there's a human component. She's also ready to have
people act on her why. So she can think about things
like how is she going to get them to understand what
she thinks should happen. And you can do that by thinking
about what people value or what metaphors and arguments
might appeal to them. We've all had a boss
who loves sports, and so lots of sports
metaphors like hitting it out of the
park or hit a home run are ways in which to activate
their emotional engagement. I used to have a boss who really wanted everyone to be happy
and to be in community. So when I would go to the boss
about specific situations, I would always try to use words about culture and community, and affection, and collegiality. Because that was the
way to get him to think favorably on the ideas
I wanted to implement. And all along in here, we're really working on
moving beyond informing. Not just telling people stuff, but how we engage them, how we awaken their
interest in the topic, and activating them to do something with
that information. So here, we can look at
what's the difference between the what approach and
the why approach. Now, in neither scenario am I suggesting that
you should make up information or falsify
your data to make your point. What I'm really thinking about is the ways
in which we package that authentic information
in a way that makes it more appealing for the
listener or the viewer. On the left, you see
the what approach. Here's a fact, wage
costs are rising. Here's a fact, wages
are cheaper in China. My recommendation is
that we move to China. Versus a why approach. And a why approach takes into consideration that there might be issues of patriotism
or national identity, or what it means to be an American to consider
an overseas move. So here, it's a very
different type of argument. Here, at the Consolidated
Widget Company, we've always prided
ourselves on honesty, integrity, and a
made-in-the-USA attitude. I'd like us to take a moment to reflect on those values as we consider how they
will translate into the 21st century marketplace. So here, there's much more of a call to something
that matters to people. So instead of just
assuming that this is a financial decision
pure and simple, it's recognizing
that there might be some complexity of
thinking that will go into being able to make the
right decision for this company and that town
at this moment in time. So part of what we're trying to do is when we do data analysis, we have all of these
dots of information. And what we want to make
sure we do is we want to make sure that we connect
the dots for folks. So if this is the galaxy, we want to make sure that we know whether we want them to see the Big Dipper or
Ursa Major, or both. And we don't want to
leave that to chance. So we're going to make
sure we structure things so that people
feel interested in what we're doing and
people are more likely to decide what it is that we think our analysis shows
is the right thing to do. So let's talk about that constellation
in the next section.
