Okay, we're familiar with
the various forms we might take. Now we're going to talk about
the fact that oftentimes you are going to be working with
data that's already been collected, already cleaned, already
presented in one form or another, as we've talked about
as we've toured various sites. And we're going to talk about ways in
which we might need to just explore various ways of thinking about data
to see if there are trends and patterns that are not obvious
at the very beginning. Sometimes, we know right away. But
as Anscombe's Quartet shows us, and you'll remember that example from Eytan's
course in beginning data visualization, sometimes we look at the data and we're surprised at what it looks
like when it's visualized. So let's get started. So here we are in our process. We're still in the period now of
trying out those potential displays. Now, we've refreshed our
memory about what they are and we're going to explore some of them. And again, I want to just reiterate
that we are in an iterative process that I don't work in a very linear way. I tend to work back and forth and
I have a feeling that you do as well. So as I was preparing this section, I was
thinking about Eytan Adar's upcoming paper in which he talks about visualizations
having learning objectives and his argument is that every visualization
is trying to teach us something. And we need to know
what that something is. And I like that a lot because as someone
who started her career in K-12 education. I know, I was a drama major and
K-12 education. It's crazy. I thought instantly about backward design,
which is from a book and a series of professional development by Wiggins and
McTighe called Understanding by Design. And in those books, they talk about
sort of the big three questions we ask when it comes to teaching and how we're going to achieve the thing
we want to achieve with students. And I hope as I explain this that it
will connect to this idea of learning objectives. So I start with what do I want my
students to know or be able to do? And in your case, it would be
what do I want my reader or my viewer to know or be able to do? How will I know that they know it? What scaffolds am I going to put in place? How am I going to be clear in my text, in my explanations,
to make sure they get there? And I'm going to monitor that as I'm
rolling out my early visualizations when I get started doing these presentations to
see that I'm reaching my audience and that the tools I've chosen work well. And then I'm going to ask my question
what information or activities or visualizations will get them there? So I concentrate most on the
first and the third here. What do I want them to know and be able
to do, and what's going to get them there? You can also think about
visualizations as having sort of, ah, so the question how do I
know what I want them to know? Good thing I put that
slide reminder in for myself. I often know that because I step
into the shoes of the novice. And I ask myself like how would I make
it so my grandma knows what I'm talking about, or how would I make it so
my neighbor knows what I'm talking about, and really having that empathetic
approach of anticipating what a novice might be thinking about. And I find sometimes that this gets
harder to do the more expert we get in our disciplines, that it gets harder
to untangle our complex understandings and our complex ideas
into simple formats. So I'm really happy with how this
course is positioned in your sequence because you're getting this just as
you're developing that jargon and so you remember what it was
like to be a novice. Another way to think about visualizations. If you grew up listening
to Aesop's Fables, then you know that every Aesop's Fable
has a moral or a lesson. Or as Sean Layne who's a Kennedy Center
teaching artist would say, what's the secret message? Your visualization should
have a secret message and your job is to make it not so secret. So every visualization, think about what
it is you want people to get out of it. Whichever of these terms
or metaphors works best for you. So when I first look at a data set, sometimes I need to think about how
would I organize that information. And this is both an exploratory and
an explanatory process for me because I might have an instinct about
what I want to highlight in the data, but sometimes running it through
those different formats and maybe different subsets of the data,
I might find something different. So one of the things that I found helpful
over time, and this goes to the video that you watched previous to this,
is Saul Wurman's LATCH technique. Wurman, whose other claim to fame is that
he founded TED Talks, thinks that all information can basically be sorted
into one of these five categories. Location, sometimes
that's a place on a map. Remember the video sections
of the grocery store? In our case, it could be states by region. We can organize data alphabetically. A lot of times when you see data and they break it down by state, it's
just alphabetical by state, right? Simple, simple. Sometimes it's chronological,
oldest to newest, newest to oldest. Sometimes it's by category, sometimes
category and location go together. So in the grocery store example, all
the cereals are in the category of cereal. Categories could be industry. It could be grade level. And
sometimes it's hierarchy. Biggest to smallest, oldest to youngest,
tallest to shortest, things like that. And so I want to walk through how I
might think about that using this short publication from
the Annie E Casey Foundation. If you do any work with children, you'll find that their Kids Count
Data Center is really helpful. What it does is it aggregates data that's
collected at the county or state level and stores it here so that you can pull it
up and look at various characteristics. It's often a little bit
more streamlined and a little bit easier to navigate than
a state education data center would be. And this one is looking
at children who are in communities of concentrated poverty,
high poverty, low opportunity. And it does some comparisons
of some data 2008 to 2012. So right in the heart of
the recession 2013 to 2017. And when you look at Table 1, you can
see it in its entirety in the back and in front you see a little
exploded piece of that data. You can see that it is a combination of
data numbers, just raw counts under number and percents, and that's repeated
in the second set of columns. And then they're looking
at percent change. And so this is a real quick way to
by sorting alphabetically that we get a whole set, a whole slate
of what the issues are and which states ideally are
doing better or worse. But it's really hard to
see which is better or worse because it's sorted
alphabetically, right? So yay, I can see my state
in one single snapshot very quickly, but I can't really
compare it to other information, right? So I decided I was going to
try an experiment. I'm reporting from the Midwest. We're at the University of Michigan
and listen folks, people have all kinds of definitions
about which states belong in the Midwest. Some people count Missouri, some don't. Some count the Dakotas, some don't. This
is one way we can categorize the Midwest. I thought what if I just
pulled data from the Midwest, could I figure anything out from that? By pulling out some data and consolidating it into a new
visualization, could I get it? So I did that and I noticed
some kind of interesting things. So here I'm sorting both by location and
sort of the category of Midwest and then alphabetical within that. And now I can see that for almost all
states, there's been a reduction in the percent of kids living in
concentrated poverty, and that's great. But I noticed Wisconsin's
exactly the same and I also noticed that the degree of change
really differs across the various groups. So we called on Lauren Murphy and we said,
well what would happen if we mapped it? Another way to look at location data,
still in the category of Midwest. And what she did was all she mapped here
was the degree of change and you can see she's done some color coding to show
which states have improved the most, like Iowa, and which states haven't
improved at all, which is Wisconsin. So another way to make sense of data. So we do see that as a whole, the Midwest is in slightly
better shape than it was before. Then I thought, let's try a slope graph. Can we show before and after? And this is a case where I use Knaflic's
idea of starting with everything gray and bringing back color as I needed it. And what I decided I wanted to show here
was the fact that Wisconsin hasn't had change at all. I think that's kind of
an interesting phenomenon. So here, you can see that we're sorting
data by time and a bit hierarchically because Michigan is in the worst shape and
Iowa's in the best shape. I could have given this
a completely different headline. I could have instead said, even though
the trend is positive, Michigan still has the most number of Midwestern kids
living in concentrated poverty, right? But I think in this case, what I wanted
to show is the no change of Wisconsin. You also see a little preattentive
attribute in here only because the University of
Wisconsin's color is red. All right, I could also another
case of sorting hierarchically and then by extension
alphabetically is this chart. These are the five states, because two
at the bottom are tied so there's five positions, that have the greatest increase
in children in concentrated poverty. Now I'm telling a slightly
different story than I was before. I'm not looking regionally, I'm looking
at the severity of the problem. And from here, I might draw
other conclusions about, is there something these states
have in common in terms of rural or urban that makes a difference? And I might
then go diving into the data in a new way. This visualization was in the Annie E
Casey Foundation report originally, so this is not our work. And what they're trying to show here
is throughout the United States, what percentage of children are living
in high concentrated poverty? And you can see that they've really made
that data stand out by turning it orange. You can also see they've taken
away the y axis to simplify and they've put these percentage
marks at the top of each bar. I might put them inside the bar. But what gets tricky here is it gets difficult
to compare the different racial groups. It's hard to find a pattern in that data. So right now, what we see is all of
the children are listed at the top and then we see an alphabetical
listing by race and ethnicity. Think about how that might be different if
we rearrange the order. And I did this just by popping the data into Excel and
re-sorting the order of the rows. Here we can see that there's a clear
distinction that some groups are significantly worse off than others
and we can see that ranking more clearly. So again, here's the before. Kind of hard to compare Asian and White, kind of a little hard to compare two or
more races with all children, pretty clear here. The one thing that we could add here is we
could add this sort of benchmarking line that says, okay, this is all children.
Which groups are performing better than the all children marker and
which are performing worse? So we see that White children
are more advantaged here, Asian and Pacific Islander children
have smaller percentages, but that some are way above the line. So this is part of why when earlier we were looking at the example of the
vertical line to show future forecasting, I kind of don't like to waste that on that
when I could use it in a place like this. Now, maybe you look through the data and
you're not seeing anything. And that could mean a couple of things. One, it could mean that you just
haven't put in enough elbow grease and you need to spend a little
bit more time exploring and running some possibilities or
looking at different formats. The other thing that can happen is that
maybe the data isn't that important to your overall learning objectives or to the overall why of why you're
writing the report in the first place. In which case, you might set that data
aside and say that data is not helpful in making the case or that the best way to
talk about that data is just to integrate it into your paragraphs and
not visualize it at all. One of the things we see often with
students as they're making their first visualizations is they're visualizing
just because they can visualize and we don't ever want to use visualizations
just as decorations in a report. We only want to use them
if they're impactful. Because their mere presence tells
the reader something here is important. So if we put non-important
information in visual format, we actually emphasize the wrong things. So before we go on to the next section,
keep taking a first best stab and a second best stab and look around
at what some possibilities might be. Keep asking about your why. What is it I'm trying to communicate? Why am I doing this report
in the first place? And keep getting back to that question of
learning objectives that Eytan has talked about. What do I want them to know or
be able to do? And you might be surprised at what you
discover if you go through a process like that. I'll see you in the next segment.
