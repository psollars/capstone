When you prepare to present, one of the things
you really want to concentrate on is maximizing the audio quality of
your presentation. Unlike in a face-to-face presentation where you can rely on body language and eye contact
to help establish meaning, you're really limited in
an online presentation, especially one like the
assignment you are going to do here where we're not
going to see your face, we're only going
to hear the audio. So we really want to make
sure that the quality of the audio is as
strong as it can be. So first of all, you want to find some kind of microphone or
use your earbuds. The Apple earbuds
are actually pretty decent for webinar audio. And you want to think
about how to minimize any audio distractions that might be in the
ambient environment. So if you have a
heating or cooling system that's going
to cycle on and off, you might turn it off so
that it doesn't kick in. You might think about closing
the windows if you're in a high-traffic area
and there might be car horns and just the noise
of cars coming and going. If you're in a co-working space, see if you can find a private
room where you can present so that you don't pick
up your co-worker's noise and phone calls
and keyboards clicking. You want to think
about not wearing any jewelry that
dangles or makes noise. For me, this is important
because not only will my jewelry under normal
circumstances make noise, but also anything that's
jangly, I'll fidget with. So if I am presenting
face to face, I'll find myself having
little nervous tics and that doesn't really make me
look like I'm at my best. So jangly jewelry comes off. Sometimes it's pets where there are dogs barking
in the background. Do what you can to put them in another room so that you
don't have their audio. And finally, you want to make sure you lay your
papers down flat on the table as opposed to having papers that you're
holding in your hand, which the microphone can
pick up the sound of the movement of even if
it's hard for you to hear. And things like that
will make it much easier for you to
be heard and again, for you to achieve that
goal of comprehension. Now let's talk a little bit
about performance style. Now when I was first
learning public speaking, there were a lot of rules. You wore a suit. If you were a woman, you
wore heels and make up. If you were male, you would
wear a suit and dress shoes. And the whole world of putting your best self forward has
changed a lot in that time. So the most important
thing that I think you can do is
match your workplace. If you work in a place
that's t-shirts and hoodies, and every time
there's a presentation, it's in t-shirts and hoodies, do the same thing. Try to remember that
whether we like it or not, our clothing does communicate
something about authority. So if you're at a white
shoe law firm, meaning that it's a very
traditional law firm, there'll be an expectation
that you dress the part. This also speaks to the kind of presentation
formality you use, whether you use hand gestures. When I was first public speaking, the rule was you had to keep
your hands to your sides at all times and only gesture
very deliberately. So I think I took the same public speaking
class that Bill Clinton must have taken
because I learned that if you needed to make a point, you had to do it like this without your fingers
sticking out. We've seen a lot of relaxing of those standards
and right now we're in a period that values
authenticity a little bit more than it values sort of
this cookie-cutter approach. But you know your workplace
and what works for you. So a couple of things to think about as you're
thinking about, well, what does it
mean to present online versus face to face? So we've talked about this
question of body language, that you can't rely on body
language to communicate. That means you can't
rely on you being able to make a point
with your body and you also can't feel
what your audience is sensing based on
what they take in. So we're filming this at the beginning of December
and my students in my residential course
are really tired. If I were presenting on line, I wouldn't know that, but because I can see it, I can make adjustments as I go. So when I don't have that tool, it's a lot tougher
for me to kind of custom fit my message. And I won't
have that vibe in the room. Sometimes I walk in a room and I can feel like
the whole room is stressed or apathetic or excited. I don't have that when I present a webinar or an online
presentation of any kind. It's just me talking to a screen. And the final thing, and this is
particularly important as we talk about interactivity
with your participants, is that you really have to plan for transmission
delays, even in 2019. And by that I mean
that there can be an awkwardly long amount of time between when you
ask something and the other party hears
it and acts on it. So one of the ways that we can try to bridge that gap between the affordances we don't have and the impact that we want
to have is to really think about this idea of
warmth in your online space. Creating an environment
that feels friendly and supportive because we have
all attended a bad webinar. One where you feel
like people are just reading a script to you or where you get on line and it's a
famous presenter you've always wanted to see speak and their voice is lackluster
or they seem really disconnected and it's not the person you know in a
face-to-face environment. So we've all been in a situation where we felt like
what's coming out of our screen as attendees is a pretty flat and
uninteresting experience. And things like structure
and rhetoric and using a storytelling
arc can help. But also, you can do
some things to make the spirit of the room feel
a little bit more lively. So one thing that you can
think about is again, thinking of your presentation not as let me tell
you what I did, but thinking about
what do I want you to learn and know
and be able to do. And we talked about that
in Week 3 a little bit. So that means you're anticipating the kinds
of questions they might have and you're
planning proactively to have them in your situation. One of the questions I get asked a lot when I am the host of various webinar series is
whether we want to show a video of the camera
of someone's face. Do we want the little
webcam picture? And you'll be using
the BlueJeans tool and BlueJeans does give
you the ability to broadcast your face as well as your voice and your slides. You want to ask whether a video of you is an asset or not. Now we've deliberately structured this course so that we
are not requiring you to use your video camera
because we'd like to minimize the unconscious bias that might happen in
the grading process. So we'll ask for your
audio but not your video. In my case, I don't think a video of me in a
webinar is an asset. First of all, I never look in the right place of my webcam. And secondly, I'm not doing anything interesting usually
when I present. I'm not demonstrating something where I would really need video, I'm not doing sign
language interpretation where you would need
to see my hands, and so for me, I don't feel like video
of me is an asset. Although you are watching an
entire video course with me, so you be the judge of that. If you work in organizations that work in low-bandwidth areas, so if you do a lot of work in rural communities or
urban communities where people might be accessing
your presentation using mobile signal
and not Wi-Fi, that might also be a factor
in determining whether you use a video of
yourself or not. That is another reason
why I don't use it. But for some of you who are very magnetic and very charismatic, you might find that
it is an asset. So you'll kind of want to
play with that as you self-assess over time. Again, not required
for this course. Another way you can think
about warming up the space besides sort of thinking
about what will my audience be looking
for and needing, is to literally pretend
like sitting across from you and your computer is
a friend or a loved one. And this is something that
my residential students have told me for years
really helps them, and you can hear it in
their presentations. They either sit down
their significant other and they do a presentation to their
significant other, or it's not always practical
in the work space, they pretend that someone like their grandmother is
sitting on the other side. And what that does is
that it really I think makes you think
more empathetically about wanting the viewer
to understand, right? We don't want to talk at grandma, we want to talk with grandma. We want grandma to
be in our world. And it is remarkable
the difference that that simple tip makes in creating this environment
that feels more intimate. You also want to determine
the degree to which this is a presentation
versus a conversation. And that will
be in part because you will hopefully get yourself some intel about
how the executive works. Do they like to hear everything and then ask some questions, or do they want to talk with
you as you move forward? And while you aren't going
to record these live, you will use that
information in the future to determine the amount of conversation and feedback
that you set up, and you can actually invite that at the start of
the presentation. So when we are working
with educators, we always in our
presentations talk about how valuable it is to talk with one another in the chat window. We don't turn on their
audio mics and have them participate as speakers
for feedback. We don't have the time, and in many cases there's a
bandwidth issue with that. But we do not only make
room for chat to happen, but we actually put a facilitator
in that room to be very welcoming and to encourage conversation and to
acknowledge what's being said. And frankly, another way to warm up the space is to be prepared. And I'm laughing because
of the number of times we've stopped today in
preparing this video. But really, what my students
have also told me over the years is that
when they are getting ready to present in
this new medium, what helps them a lot often is they script out
their entire talk, and then as they
practice over time, they get better at
speaking extemporaneously. They also get sharper
in their message. And by the time they
actually go to record, they rarely need to read
their script any more. If you've ever been in a webinar where you can tell they're
reading off a script, sometimes federal
agencies are required to read off of a script
for presentations, you know that a scripted feeling creates a kind of barrier between
you and your audience. So the more you can
practice, the better.
