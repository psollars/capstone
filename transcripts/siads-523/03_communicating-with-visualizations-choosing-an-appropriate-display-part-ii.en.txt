Let's continue looking at
various data formats and things we might want to think about as we
choose them and create them and edit them. Let's kind of keep going by talking
about bar graphs and charts. These are really good when you
want to compare quantity of things. Here's an example of
a not-so-great bar chart. You'll see this example a lot of times
on line when people are talking about visualizations. When you look at this,
your big instinct is wow, there's a huge difference
between those two bar charts. This screenshot shows a group that's
trying to persuade you that this is a big problem. But if you look at this
a little bit more closely, you see that the y axis starts at 34. And that's why the now figure
looks so stubby and then there's such a big
difference as it leaps up to 40. Now, we aren't trying to persuade
people or to manipulate data or to try to make the data
say something it doesn't. So when I work on data literacy
strategies with educators and K-12 students, we always say
keep an eye on the y, and that turns out to be one
of the real strengths. That's one of those tips
that just keeps going and keeps going in terms of how
helpful it is to people. So if we're trying to communicate and
not be manipulative, then our goal is that we've got to
be more honest about the y axis. So to quote Chiqui Esteban
from National Geographic, this is an example of broken scales. And broken scales show drama
where it doesn't exist. I am a drama major,
I'd like to keep my drama on stage. So this is not new, this is not exclusive
to any political group or any ideology. These are examples from 1954's
How to Lie with Statistics that demonstrate the same thing. You can see that if you truncate the
y axis that you're going to get what looks like a stronger trend line. And if we smoosh data in a certain way we
can make the data look yet another way. Our goal with data communication is
that we are trying to accurately and succinctly describe data. So compare this one to this one. If what we're really
trying to do is be accurate, this would be a better
way to visualize that. Now, I don't want to point fingers at
Fox News because when you go to visualize data like this in most
spreadsheet software, you will find that they will
truncate the y axis by default. What we want to think about is
how we can go in and fix that. So I'm going to take you on a quick
tour just so you can see how to do that in Excel so that you can
get to the y axis starting at 0, and that is considered the professional
standard right now. So we only had these two columns of data,
date and percentage. And you can see that that Excel started
this at the line of 31 instead of, I think they started maybe
at 35 in the other one. And what you can do though is if you
right-click on those y axis interval marks, you will get this format access chart
to pop up on the right-hand side. And there's a section that says
bounds minimum and maximum. Set the minimum to 0 and
that's what you'll end up with. And you'll also notice, by the way,
that when this was in Excel, it did have a lot of extra labels
that we did not end up using here. And that's because when I took it out
of Excel I plopped it in PowerPoint, I traced those images, and
I removed things I didn't need. By putting the percent right inside
the bars and not on the y axis, I reduced that visual clutter, what
your textbook author calls it, or the unnecessary distractions, right? All I really need to know is
dates and numbers. So it's still accurate because I
know it started at the y axis. Hopefully that will help up
your game a little bit, and this is often what I do.
I figure something out in Excel, I plop it in PowerPoint, and
I tidy it up in PowerPoint. Stacked graphs and charts are about
comparing parts of a whole, so in this way they're
like a pie chart. So we want to see how the entirety
of something is divided up, but also looking at how we can compare
whole to whole as data changes. So for example, this is an example from the Census
Department that's trying to look at how demographics are changing depending
on the age band that they study. So you'll see that on
the x axis we see under 18, 2010/2018, 18 to 39, same years, 40 to 64, same years,
63 and older, same years. And then you have these very distinctive
color bands that make it very easy to tell the difference between data. So we can see both what's
the population in millions that's under 18 in each age but we can see how
that population is divided up. And the thing about this color scheme
is that it's kind of weird, but it does kind of grow on you
because it's fresh, right? And we really see that contrast
is our friend here. This one I'm just going to put in.
This is part of a data dashboard from the New Jersey state data center. A lot of this is auto-generated, but I
found that this population age group one, what they've done is they've
taken these major industries that they've illustrated
in this pie chart, and they have visualized the ages of employees.
And each age band here is a certain age. So we can not only see that leisure and
hospitality is a really big market sector, but we can also see that ages
are pretty distributed over time and that there's a huge amount of folks
under age 25 that work in those jobs. We can also see that that is such
a big industry compared to, say, technology or finance, that there's
a lot of people working in that work. That's all you need to check out on that
one, but this was a way of thinking about industries that I had not thought
of before and I really enjoyed it. Now we're going to come to pie charts. So you will find in the data visualization
literature when you read posts on media, when you see folks on social media, that
people are either on team pie chart or team never pie chart. And what pie charts do is they
show us parts of a whole, but if we're not careful they can go a little
off the rails and easily be misconstrued, sometimes because software will make
something into a pie chart that it really shouldn't. So I still think they're very
effective because they're so easily understood by others, but there's a little bit more onus put on us
as the creators to check our own work. So one of the ways, for example,
I really like to use pie charts, I alluded to small multiples, I kind of
gave away my secret in the last section. I really like to use pie charts in
a series to show change over time. So what you see here is,
it's very clear that something's changing in the balance between whatever
two variables are being measured. I think the reason that we're seeing
people be on never pie chart team is because of ones like this. And to me this this kind of
violates lots of rules. First, we've talked I think before
about Microsoft colors and fonts and how they make your work
look like everybody else's. So clearly these were generated in
Excel because we recognize these colors, we've seen them in
a million visualizations before. And throughout the course what I'm trying
to push you towards is some simple ways in which we can use some simple
visual elements to elevate our work so it looks more unique and
stands out from other people's work. The big challenge here, of course, is that
there's way too many slices in this pie. So there's way too much of this
chart that means nothing to us. I generally think that if I've got five to
seven pie charts, five slices, I'm okay. Any more than that and I'm going to
lose value. And what you can do if you find that you have data that takes
more than five to seven buckets or seven slices is you can combine data
into fewer but larger sections. So for example here they're showing
who has the world's largest economies. They're assuming that the pie
is all world economies. And they start, a pie chart should
have the biggest slice in the top left the top right corner, sorry,
and then decrease from there. So the second biggest economy is China, it goes clockwise after the United States
and the slices get smaller and smaller. And then there's a big section of gray,
which is other, because really what are we probably trying
to get at in a visualization like this is that there are some nations that
have an outsized impact on the economy. And what's less important
is those folks who do not. Now, we can debate whether
the use of these flags to illustrate each pie
segment adds value or not. I tend to think not, except I'm
kind of fond of that American flag and the China flag,
I think those are kind of pretty. It's when we get into the smaller slices
that suddenly it starts to look choppy and we're not sure whether the lines that
are part of the flag's design are part of the slices. So I tend to be a little bit simpler. Notice too how they have
put the percentages and the labels right on the pie slice,
not on the outside, except when the pie slices start to get smaller
and then there's no room to fit it. Another way to sort of minimize the
clutter that is outside of the pie chart. And now let's look at another reason
people are not on team pie chart and that is that sometimes people make pie
charts that don't add up to 100% and here is an example. So this tells us in text that
over half of the people that they surveyed have received treatment for
mental health conditions. And rather than have the pie chart show
well, here's those half and here's the slightly less than half that don't,
they left out the slightly less than half. And so you get this kind of
weird-looking pie chart. We know that green part of
the circle is way more than 30%. And this is a case of if you put those
numbers in Excel, Excel will generate this for you. So would Google Sheets, because
they're still not human beings. So you still need to have a sense
when you go into a visualization, what do I think this should look like? And then, does it look like that? You don't have to be perfect, but getting that mental mindset can help you
save yourself from moments like this. Now, we're going to come back and look at
the process of making this visualization a little bit later in our work. This is what I mean when I say that using
pie charts in combination is powerful. There was some research done by the
Michigan Transportation Asset Management Council that was originally visualized
as a bar graph by the Detroit Free Press. And that bar graph does
a lot of good stuff. But what I wanted to really show here is
if you've got roads in good condition or fair condition or poor condition, how can I show that
the number of roads in bad condition, that percentage, is getting really
big in this time between 2004 and 2014, this decade that's on either
side of the 2008 recession, which actually starts in Michigan a little
earlier and runs a little longer. All I really need to do here is
visualize these two points and a pie chart is a perfect way to
illustrate the severity of that change. But to do that I really had to tell
a story where I combined the other two data points. So really the story I'm telling is what
percentage are decent, like good enough, and what percentage are bad, right? And so I don't really need to divide
fair and good into their own categories. Nice simple graphic. Don't really
need the percents, because that's not what I'm trying to communicate here. And again, that's a judgment call
that you'll make as you work through these processes. I could also have added the percent
right next to the word, but notice how I'm keeping those
labels inside the pie chart so it's really minimizing the amount of
clutter that's outside the colored area. All right, I've mentioned that
I am on team good pie chart. I am not on team donut. I feel like donuts are trying to be
a streamlined version of a pie chart and what they do is that they
leave the center empty so it's shaped like a washer or
shaped like a disc. I think that they do look less cluttered
and I do think they look modernized. But I have some concerns about them
because I often wonder if novices know that the center of the donut
is only there for aesthetics. And I often wonder if they think that
that circle means something in the middle. And this is a JP Morgan Chase
visualization where I struggled to know
what that meant. First of all, we thank JP Morgan Chase
for making these investments in in the city of Detroit,
which is what they are modeling here. But the numbers on the left
add up to about $50 million. Then we've got the section on the right
that's also $50 million, and it fits the same color pattern
that's going from 12 o'clock around. Like we went from darkest color, biggest slice,
to lighter colors for smaller slices. But then the question's raised there's
only a donut in the first half and not in the second half. Are they trying to say
this is $50 million total? Or is this a total $100
million investment? I feel like this raises
more questions than it answers. Or it explains why I did not
become a banker as a job. But really what bothers me about that
circle is that the city of Detroit in itself has two other independently
governed communities inside its border. And so now I don't know does
that hole in the donut stand for Hamtramck and Highland Park or
does it stand for something else? So I'm not a big fan of
the donut because I think for novices it raises new questions. You'll also see that the donut when
combined with things like detaching the pie circles from each other and
sort of pushing them out a little bit. Again, we've got the problem here
that this doesn't add up to a 100%. And also by pulling the data apart,
it becomes even harder to assess the difference between each pie slice,
even if you've got a number. It can kind of distort things because
we can't kind of connect the slices to each other as as visual comparisons. So donut chart, not my favorite. And finally, while we're on the subject
of things that are not my favorite, I am old enough to have remembered when
you could make these 3D charts in tools like Excel for the first time and how much
fun it was to make things that were 3D. But the reality is that 3D
visualisations add more visual clutter. They can often make segments
seem larger than they are. And, when you combine them with that
default Microsoft color palette and the default Microsoft font of Calibri,
you end up creating something that's no lower longer a wow,
but it's just run of the mill. And we can do better than that here. All right, I'll get off my pie chart,
donut hole, high horse and I'll meet you in the next
section to keep going.
