Hello. In the last video we discussed the influence
maximization problem, and we talked about how
the greedy algorithm, what's a good approximation
algorithm for this problem in the context of the
Independent cascade model and the linear threshold model. Today we're going to
talk about heuristics. What if running this
greedy algorithm actually ends up being pretty
expensive computationally? Are there other ways that we can use in order to identify
these set of seed nodes that could potentially
work well in order to maximize the number
of infected nodes. We have shown that
this greedy algorithm can provide a good approximation, but it can also be
computationally expensive. Remember, all of the many
simulations that you would be required to run in order to figure out the
best possible set of seed nodes under
the greedy algorithm. You have to run a simulation or many simulations to
find the first node, then many more simulations for
the second node and so on. This can itself be very
computationally expensive, especially if we are doing
this in a very large network. One thing that we may wonder is, are there other ways or other techniques that we can use for choosing the
set of seed nodes, even if they don't have a particular guarantee as
the greedy algorithm does, and how would they perform
against the greedy algorithm. Well, one reasonable
heuristic would be to choose nodes that have high
centrality as seed nodes. As we've talked about before, notes with high centrality
have lots of connections, they're relatively close in network distance to other nodes, they show up in shortest paths
between groups and so on. It's not unreasonable to
imagine that if we were to pick the nodes with the highest
centrality as seed nodes, we may do relatively well in
generating large cascades. Our goal is to look at empirical results that try
to make this comparison. The first one looks at a
network of collaboration in physics publications based
on papers on the archive. Using this data, we
construct a network where the nodes are the
authors of these papers, there are about 10,000
nodes and the edges are pairs of researchers who have co-authored at
least one paper, and this is about 53,000 edges. The authors run simulations of the Independent
cascade model using edge weights of 0.01 and multiple strategies
to choose the seed notes, including the greedy algorithm, and here are the results. On the x-axis we have the
size of the seed nodes sets, so this goes from zero to 30, and on the y-axis we have the
number of infected nodes. The different curves represent different ways of
choosing the seed notes. On the top here the highest curve is the greedy algorithm, and this is not surprising, there's a guarantee
that it performs well relative to the actual
optimal strategy. Note that we don't
have a curve here for the optimal one since again, is very expensive to get because that problem
is empty hard, and so we see that
the greedy algorithm performs pretty well. Here is the curve for degree centrality,
is this curve here. I know that legends a
little hard to see, so I have these arrows indicating where each
of the strategies ends after the set of seed nodes has gone
all the way to 30. This one that ends here
is degree centrality, the one that ends right below it, is closeness
centrality, and the one there we have all the way
here at the bottom is random. If we just choose
seed nodes at random, this is the number of
infected nodes we get. A couple of things to
note here, first of all, the degree in
closeness centrality don't do as well as
the greedy algorithm, but the distance from the centrality strategies to the greedy algorithm
is not super-large. Now, whether or not this
difference here is large or not, really depends on the context. How much is it worth having
these additional gain versus the potential computational cost of actually running
the greedy algorithm. It really depends on the
details of the application. But we can see here that the
difference from random to greedy is much larger
than the difference from the heuristic of
centrality to greedy. It is indeed very
expensive to run the greedy algorithm using the centrality heuristics
seems to be much, much better than just
picking nodes at random. What if we tried the same thing on the linear threshold model? In this case, the authors choose random thresholds for
the linear threshold model. Well, here are the results
of that, and we basically, see a similar story.. Random
performed very poorly, you don't see a big
increase in the number of infected nodes when you just pick nodes at random
really is the best, and then degree centralities sits somewhere in the middle, but much closer to
the performance of the greedy algorithm than the performance of
just random nodes. This empirical results show
that choosing the seed nodes using the centrality heuristics seems like a reasonable strategy, if we are unable to run
the greedy algorithm. Next, I would like to talk about a different type of problem, and that is that we don't
always have full information or sometimes even any information about the structure
of the network. If we don't have
that information, then all bets are off in terms of using the greedy algorithm
or using heuristics that include finding
the centrality of the nodes because
all of those things require that you
know the network. What can you do if you
are wanting to spread some type of thing on a population that you
know sits on a network, there is an underlying
network structure underneath, but you don't have access
to that information? The story looks like this, you know the nodes are there, you know who they are, that's the population
you're interested in treating and there is a network, but that's hidden from
you, what can you do? One of the ways that people can handle a situation
like this is to use this nomination strategy
and what it is is that, you will recruit random
people for your intervention, let's say this is a health
intervention that will be the actual obligation that
we'll talk about next. You choose just random
people from this population, and rather than choosing
them, let's say, the seed nodes for
your intervention, you ask them to nominate
a friend and then you target the friend instead of
the randomly chosen nodes. Why should this work?
This should remind you of the preferential
attachment model, where we had nodes come into
the network and they would either attach to someone at random or they would choose a node and then they
would copy the edge, this would be equivalent
to copying the edge. What we had seen is
that when you do that, then you end up attaching to the very central nodes because those nodes have
lots of connections, so you're very likely to find
them if you follow an edge. It's the same thing here, if you choose people at random and you ask them to
nominate a friend, then that friend that gets nominated is going to be
more likely to be one of these highly central nodes than the original person you've found by randomly picking nodes. Hat's the intuition behind it, so you choose some node and
that node has some edges, of course you don't
see these edges, but you ask them to
nominate a friend and so potentially you get one of
the friends of these nodes. If you choose node B at random, then B has these
three connections and you will get one
of those instead of B, and so on and again, the claim is that the
nominated people are more likely to be central than the
random nodes that you get. Next, let's talk about an
experiment that was run using exactly this nomination
strategy and we're actually comparing it
to other strategies where you did have access
to the network and then they were able
to compare how well the nomination strategy works against other ways
of targeting the nodes. The context here is, there are 27 villages in Honduras who received
the health intervention, that was the goal
of the experiment to spread awareness about these multivitamins that were
helpful for the population. Nice thing is that
they had access to 27 villages in
Honduras who were all disconnected from
each other and so you could run
experiments where you wouldn't have the problem of spillover from one
village to another, you could run
localized experiments in each of the 27 villages. The idea is that they wanted to find a small set of people and apply some intervention
on them and then hope that they could spread
the word about this vitamins, about this health behavior
of taking this vitamins, by telling their friends and
their social connections. As I said, they're comparing three different
targeting methods, the first one is choosing people at random
and treating them, so they did that in
nine of the villages. The other one was to choose villagers with
the most social ties, for those nine villages they had information about the social
network in the village. They went, collected
that information,and so now they knew who were the most central nodes where
and they targeted them. The last one is where they applied this nomination strategy, they found people at
random and asked them to nominate one of their friends and then they
treated the friends. The treatment here
was that they would receive the multivitamins
and they will also receive four
tickets that they could hand to other people and
then with those tickets, those people could
come in and get vitamins as well as four tickets that they could then hand
to other people and so on. After 15 days, the researchers compared the fraction of tickets that were redeemed in each of
the targeting methods and it turns out that
the nomination strategy outperformed both the random
and the degree strategies. On the x-axis we have the number of days since initial targeting
and in the y-axis we have the proportion
of tickets that were redeemed and we can see that the nomination strategy performed
better than the others, these were all
statistically significant. One interesting thing was that, the random one actually outperformed the
degree centrality. This suggests that this
nomination strategy seems to work pretty well, especially in cases
where you have no information about the network, it would be very
expensive to collect this information and so applying this nomination strategy could be a good way to find those
people who are going to help you spread these
particular intervention or these health behavior. You will be watching
a video that talks a little bit about the
experiment and how the researchers went
about collecting the information about
the network and all of the different difficulties that people had in this villages and how they managed to overcome many challenges
that came up. It's a very interesting
video, I hope you enjoy it.
