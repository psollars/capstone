Hello, in this video, we're going to
be looking at the SIR Model, which is different from the SIS Model, and the SI
Model that we have looked at previously. And in this case we have a model where
there are now three types of nodes, the susceptibles, the infected,
and then the removed. In this SIR model nodes are temporarily
infected and then they are removed so that they can no longer get infected or
infect others. This captures cases when infected people
will gain immunity to the virus and get to a point where they can no
longer get the virus or infect others. Or you can also think of cases where
the virus actually kills someone and of course that person can no
longer infect anyone else. The model dynamics are going to play out
in a very similar way as they did for the SIS model. But now instead of transitioning
from the I to the S class, we're going to transition
from the I to the R class. And so
let me tell you how the dynamics play out. We started with the typical set of
seed notes people who are infected in the beginning of the process. And then at each iteration
that infected nodes will try to infect their neighbors
with probability p, and then they will be removed from
the network with probability r. So that's the parameter that's analogous
to the s parameter that used to tell us the probability that notes move
from being infected to susceptible. Now the other parameter tells us
the probability that nodes go from being infected to being removed. Let's work through
a simulation of this for five iterations as we have done for
other models. The unique thing here is that we're going
to be keeping track of three types of nodes this susceptibles,
infected and ever removed. In the susceptible we're going to call our
white, the in fact that we're going to call it a red and then the removed
we're going to call it a grey. So in the first iteration
that no D who's the one who's initially infected will try
to infect its neighbors. So node C, G and
E can potentially become infected. And let's say that note C and
G actually become infected. And now the nodes who are affected in
the previous state will transition to the removed class with probability 0.3 and
so in this case node D may get removed. And let's say in this case it does not. Now at t equals 2, the currently infected notes will
try to first infect their neighbors. And so let's say that nodes B and
E become infected in this iteration. And now the nodes that were previously
infected will transition to the removed class with probability 0.3,
that's node C, D, and G. In this case, again,
none of them actually get removed. Iteration number 3 nodes who
are infected try to infect their neighbors with probability 0.5,
so now A and H become infected. So now everyone except for F is infected. And then the nodes that were previously
infected will go to the removed class with probability 0.3. And let's say that in this case nodes D,
E and G get removed and so
now we're going to color them gray. Now nodes A, B, C, and H, who
are the ones who are currently infected will try to infect their neighbors. But you will note that in this case, they actually don't have any neighbors
who are not either infected or removed. The only node who hasn't been infected or
removed yet is node F here, but none of the infected nodes point to F. So no one can infect F and
no new node can get infected right now. And now the four infected
nodes will transition to the removed class with probability 0.3. And let's say node A is removed. And then the currently infected nodes
will try to infect their neighbors with probability0.5. But again, they don't have any neighbors
to infect, and so no one gets infected. And then they will transition to
the removed class with probability 0.3. And let's say that H does that. And we're done with our five iterations. And so
two things to note are the following. So, F will never be infected because again
there is no path from a currently infected node to F without using any of the removed
nodes and those have been removed. And so they cannot be infected,
so no one can get to F. And also, these two nodes, B and C, will eventually be removed since at
each iteration, they get removed to probability 0.3 with enough iterations
they will eventually be removed. So eventually in this network everyone but
F will be removed, and F will never be infected. Let's see how the model parameters again
impact the cascade size (the number of infected nodes). We'll start with D as a seed node and
we'll do 50 iterations. And, let's look at parameters p
equals 0.5, and r equals 0.1. We will keep track of three different
types of nodes so, in the x-axis we have the iteration number, and then in
the y-axis we have the number of nodes. And, so green is this susceptible nodes,
blue is the infected nodes, and then orange is the set of remove nodes. And what happens is, okay,
we start with only one infected node and everyone else is susceptible no
one is removed in the beginning. And what happens is that the number
of infected nodes start to go up. And then the number of susceptible
nodes who starts to go down. And for a while no one is getting removed, the probability of getting
removed is on the small side 0.1. And so the number of remove nodes does
not start to increase until sometime. But when it starts to increase,
then it kind of takes everyone, right? So at this point here we have
that all the nodes are infected. And so what happens from this
point is that they will slowly but surely start to go down because
they're all getting removed. So they're all switching from the infected
clusters to the removed clusters. So here the orange is becoming larger and
larger. Now let's see what happens when we
switch the parameters such that we increase the parameter r. So now we're going to
be describing a virus, where people do not get to spend too
much time in the infected class. They will soon switch to the removed
class because the probability of switching from infected
to removed became larger. So what happens in that case? So we're going to use
probability p of 0.5, we'll leave that constant but
we'll increase our from 0.1 to 0.4. And so
what happens there is the following. So what you see is that the number of
infected nodes starts to increase, but it does not get very large. And the reason why it doesn't get
very large Is that many of those nodes are quickly becoming removed. And because they're
quickly becoming removed, not all of the susceptible
nodes eventually get infected. And so at some point what you have
is that no new nodes is infected. And because no node is infected, none of
the susceptible nodes can become infected and so things kind of stopped there. And so unlike the previous case where
eventually everyone was removed. What we see here is not because nodes
were not able to spend too much time in the infected state when they're actually
trying to infect their neighbors. Then the virus was not able to
remove everyone in that network. And we're left with 5 remove nodes and 3 susceptible nodes that
sort of survived the virus. Now let's see what happens when we
increase that parameter r even more. And so what happens is that we see kind
of an extreme version of what we saw in the previous plot. And so here, again, the number of
infected nodes does not increase very rapidly early on because
they very quickly become removed. And so what we see is the number of
removed nodes increasing rapidly initially. And at some point early, the number
of infected nodes goes to 0, and so no new susceptible node
can become infected. And so
all the susceptible node stay susceptible, and no new node becomes infected. And we're left with 5 susceptible nodes,
and only 3 removed nodes. So what we can see here is that as the
probability of being removed increases, fear nodes become infected early on. And nodes do not stained
infected class for very long, such that the number of eventually
removed nodes decreases. And so
that's what happens with these SIR model. Again, it's a little bit different
from this SI and the SIS model, in that nodes go from being
infected to being removed. And we see this interesting dynamics
of what happens when nodes are getting removed very quickly as soon
as they become infected. In the next video we're going to be
looking at a different model is called the independent cascade model. And it's going to make
slightly different assumptions from the other three that
we have looked at so far. So, we'll see you there.
