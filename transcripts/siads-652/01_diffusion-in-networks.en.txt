Hello. This week we're going to talk about diffusion
in social networks. Our goal will be
to understand how things like viruses, ideas, and even behaviors spread on a population that sits on an
underlying social network. In order to do that, we're going to be exploring
different models of information diffusion that make different assumptions about
how the model plays out. How does an idea, a behavior, or a virus spread
into a population? Well, clearly the properties of the pathogen or the idea
itself should matter. For example, how contagious
virus is should matter, more contagious viruses
will spread more widely than non
contagious viruses. How long day infectious period
lasts, should also matter, and if we're talking
about an idea, how good the idea is
should also matter. We would expect that,
or at least hope that good ideas tend to spread more than bad ideas.
These things matter. However, the network structure of the affected population
also matters. How does the network
structure impact the way that the diffusion dynamics play out when something diffuses on it? What we'll do this
week is will cover a variety of models
that again make different assumptions
about the dynamics of the diffusion process, and we'll compare and
contrast the different types of cascades that they generate. Our goal will be to model both the spread of
diseases such as viruses and also the spread
of ideas and behaviors. At first, this might
seem a little strange. How can we model these things that seem
so different from each other under the same model
or through the same lens? In fact, why should ideas
spread like viruses at all? Well, when we look at diffusion
of innovations theory, which aims to understand
how innovations such as technology diffuse
from person to person, we see the following. We see that when people
are trying to decide whether or not to
adopt an innovation, they will observe the decisions
that other people made, and these would be people who are their neighbors in
their social network. They will observe their outcomes, so how well this worked
out for their neighbors, and after that, they'll
make a personal decision. We can think of people as
infecting each other with these new idea or this new behavior that's
spreading on the network, much like it happens
with a virus. The very first model and
we're going to be looking at, is probably the simplest
model you could ever imagine or you
could ever think of. It's called the SI model. This model assumes that
individuals go through two stages during an epidemic or during the spread of a virus or an idea. First you have the susceptible. Susceptible are nodes
that have not been infected by the virus
or by the idea yet. Then you have the ones
that have been infected, these are the infected nodes. Next, let me tell you how
the model dynamics play out. You started with a set
of infected seed nodes. The seed nodes are going to be those that get infected first. You can think of
these as being maybe the first adopters of some
technology the people who are very excited to try out something new when no one else in the
population has tried it out. Or maybe the first
few people who joined this population and bringing in some type of virus with them. These will be the seed nodes. Then the model is going
to move in iterations. At each iteration, every
infected node will pass through the disease to
its susceptible neighbors. These would be the nodes
that it points to. That's the neighbors
with some probability p. This perimeter p is fixed in the beginning of the
process once and for all, so this parameter p is
fixed, does not change, you get to set it in the
beginning of the simulation. Now once a node becomes infected, it will stay infected forever. Again, very, very simple model. Let's simulate a run of this model on this
very simple network. We'll set the parameter p to be 0.3 and we'll say node
D as the seed node. Here in the network, I'm coloring the nodes that
have been infected red. We'll start with D as red
because D is the seed node, the one that becomes
infected without anyone infecting them they
reduced originally infected when the
simulation begins. At t equals 1 or at
the first iteration, infected nodes, in this case
just the set of node D, infect their
neighbors or tried to infect their neighbors
with probability p. In this case, nodes C, G, and E would potentially
become infected by D. Let's say that only
note C was infected, so because there's a probability 0.3 of becoming infected, C became infected by the
node E, and G did not. Then at t equals 2, the infected nodes C and D
will infect their neighbors. In this case, the nodes B, H, G, and E will potentially
become infected, and so we'll roll the dye, and in this case actually no new nodes became
infected, and that's okay? No one new became infected, we'll go on to the
next iteration. At t equals 3, infected nodes will infect their neighbors, that's the same set of neighbors as in the past iteration. In this time, nodes E
and H become infected. Now we have four
uninfected nodes who will try to infect their neighbors
and the next iteration. Nodes A, B, and G will
potentially become infected now. In this case, only
node B was infected. At t equals 5 we have these five notes trying to
infect their neighbors, and in this case, G became infected
and no one else did, and that's our final iteration. Note that in this
very simple model, all of the nodes that
are reachable from at least one of the seed nodes will eventually become infected, if we let it run for long enough. That's because once a
node becomes infected, it will stay infected
forever and will forever continue to try to
effect their neighbors. Eventually, every
infected node will get all of their neighbors
if we wait long enough. This is of course
a very simplistic, very elementary model, just to get us started
thinking about how we want to model this, what assumptions we want
to make, and so on. In the next video, we're going to start making
the model a bit more realistic by changing the
different types of assumptions. For example, the fact that
people stay infected forever, perhaps it's not so
realistic and so we'll address that and
we'll continue to, again, expand the complexity of our models in order to make
him a bit more realistic. But this is a starting point. We'll see you in those videos.
