Now that we have seen several
centrality measures, in this video, we want to compare them. And what we'll do is that we'll
take a single network and see how the different centrality
measures rank the nodes differently. We'll do this for this directed network. In the first traveling measure
we're going to look at is the most basic one which is In-Deg. So that means we're just counting how many
edges are pointing to a specific node. And here we see that nodes 1 and
6 have the highest in degree. They both have an in degree of four. All of the other notes have
an in degree of just two. And so, this is trying to measure
ranks both 1 and 6 as top notes, and it cannot distinguish between
any of the other ones. All of the other ones
come at second place. I'm going to be constructing
tables like this, where I'll put a red line that
indicates where the ties break. So In-Degree says 1 and
6 are the highest centrality nodes, and everything else comes second. Next, let's look at closeness. And closeness is the one that looks at
how far the node is from all the other nodes in the network. It looks at the average distance from
the node to all the other nodes. And the nodes with the lowest average
distance are the ones that are central. In this network 5 is the most
central node according to closeness. And you can see that that makes sense
because it kind of sits in the middle. It's sort of the one that if you want it
to reach any other node in the network, you're probably closest to, right? So it's easy to get to this item network
is easy to get to this size or network. You don't have to jump very much. Then 1 and 6 are next and
then in again, it makes sense. Those are pretty central
not a central as 5, but they're also kind of in
the middle of the whole thing. Next our nodes 2 and 3. Now note that nodes 2 and 3 both have
the same clothes and centrality but there is actually a structural
difference between them. That difference is that node 2 here shows
up in the shortest path between 1 and 4. That is if you're coming from node 1 and we want to get to 4 you have to go
through node 2 in order to get there. Whereas that's not the case for 3. So while that doesn't really
impact their closeness centrality, it is a structural
difference between the two. And is the same thing on this
bottom side of network 7 and 8, I will be discussing this
side of the network and by the symmetry the same kind of
ideas will apply here at the bottom. And finally we have nodes 4 and 9, and
four comes last in closeness centrality. And that's because it does not have
a direct edge to node 2 in order to go from 4 to 2 you have to first hop
to node 3 and then you can get to 2, whereas for 3 and 2, they both can
reach each other in just one hop. Other than that 2, 3 and 4 are the same,
but because of that difference, 4 comes last for closeness centrality. Next comes betweeness centrality,
and that's the one that says you're a central node if you show up in
the shortest paths between other nodes. And this is where we'll
actually see those differences that I was describing between 2 and
3 become important. So the most central node for
between a centrality is node 5. And again, this makes sense all of the
shortest paths that take you from any node from this side of the network to any node
to that side of the network are going to have to pass through node 5. And so it makes sense that this is the
most central node it shows up in a lot of shortest paths. 1 and 6 same thing. They're very central, so they're a second. And now we see the third and
we get the 2 and 7 are the third. And now between a centrality says that 2
has a higher centrality than nodes 3 and 4, whereas in the case of closeness 2 had the same centrality as node
3 as we noted earlier. So between us is able to distinguish this
structural difference between two and three while closeness is not able to. Next is 3 and 8. And finally 4 and 9. Now let's look at PageRank. So what does PageRank say? Well, patriarch actually
says that nodes 1 and 6 are the most central
nodes in the network. And then comes 5. So it took kind of flips 1 and 6 and
5 compared to closeness and betweeness. And the reason for that,
or part of the reason for that is that five here points
to both nodes one and six. So if you think about how Page Rank
works 5 will give all of its page rank to nodes 1 and 6. Well, if you look at what 6 and 1 are
doing, they are giving some of their page ranks back to 5, but they're also
giving to other nodes like node 7. And so, that's part of the reason why
5 ends up being second to 1 and 6. The rest is similar as between this
you get 2 and 7, 3 and 8, and 4 and 9. So pretty similar but there's a bit of a flip in terms of
which one is a top node for Page Rank. Next let's look at authorities from the
hits algorithm from pops in authorities. In this case, you get that 1 and
6 are number one, just like for PageRank. And then what's a bit surprising,
is that 4 and 9 are next. So what happened to node 5,
which had been pretty central for all of the other measures? What happened to node 2 and 7 which
were definitely more central than 4 and 9 according to all of
the other centrality measures. We'll discuss that in a minute, but let's kind of continue going
through the authorities course. So then you get 3 and
8,then you get finally 2 and 7 and finally you get node 5. So 5 has the lowest authority according
to hit Which is very surprising because all of the others centrality measures
had 5 as either first or second. And so here's what happens if
you remember the hits algorithm is tracking two scores for each node,
the authority score and the hub score. And so in order to understand
what's happening here, we have to look at what's
happening to the hub scores. So here are the hub scores. And what's happening is that, the nodes
with the highest hub scores here are 2, 5 and 7, the ones that we were wondering
about why they came so low in authority. So what's happening is that the way that
hits is interpreting this network is saying that 2, 5 and 7 are very good
notes, but they're just good hubs. Whereas 1 and
6 are the ones that are good authorities. So you kind of have to interpret these two
together in order to get a full picture of what this centrality measure is saying. And then finally, you get 3 and
8, 4 and 9 and 1 and 6. So there's a bit of nuance here in
the hits algorithm where you have to think about both measures together and
to get a full picture. In Summary, what we see is that first
no pair of centrality measures produces the exact same ranking of the nodes. While they may have commonalities there is
no single pair that is exactly the same. And what's happening is that
this centrality measures make different assumptions about
what it means to be central. And those assumptions,
will make an impact in the ranking. Even if they're correlated,
they will make some changes in the actual rankings even in
a small network like this. Now, you might be wondering,
well then in that case, how do we know which one
is the best measure? And that depends on the context. If it matters to you that nodes show up
in the shortest paths of other nodes. Then between those should be it. What matters is that a node has a lot of
connections pointing to it than in degree might be it. Sometimes we don't have the full context,
we actually aren't clear. And in that case, what's best to do is
identify central nodes by looking at multiple centrality measures and seeing which ones show up as
central in multiple of them. So not nodes that happen to be first for
just one, but nodes that are always in the top,
say 10 percentile or something like that. If we're looking at very large networks
for multiple centrality measures, it's a good strategy. And these will be all for
our section on centrality measures.
