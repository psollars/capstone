In this video, we're
going to be talking about the independent
cascade model. This is going to be a
new model that is simple enough that it is mathematical
tractable in many ways. But it's also a bit more
general than some of the other models that we've
been discussing this week. The previous models have
assumed that all of the edges have the
same probability of transmitting an infection. For example, in the SI model, when a node became infected, it had a probability p of
infecting its neighbors, and that p would be fixed in the beginning
and it would be the same for all the nodes and all of the edges
in the network. In the independent cascade model, we're going to relax
that assumption. We're going to
allow every edge to have its own probability
of transmission. Now our networks will
look more like this, where we'll have notes in the edges and the edges are
going to have a probability attached to it and
that probability indicates the probability that if the source node
becomes infected, that it will infect its neighbor. So for this model, we're going to start
with a network and a set of probabilities, p,u,v that are going to be
associated to the edge uv, and we're also going to
start with an initial set of infected nodes
at time t equals 0. Now the model is
going to look like a generalized version
of the SIR model. So nodes are going to start out as susceptible or not infected, then they're going to become
infected and then for a short period of
time they're going to be able to infect
their neighbors. In fact, each node is only
going to be able to try to infect its neighbors one time whenever it
becomes infected. So the way it works
is the following, we started out with
our set of seed nodes, the set of infected nodes at time t equals 0 and then
at each time step t, any node u that became
infected at time t minus 1 will infect each
uninfected neighbor with probability P, u, v. Note here that only the nodes that became
infected at t minus 1 will have an opportunity
to infect their neighbors at time t. This is what
I was saying earlier. Every node has only
one opportunity to infect her neighbors, and the process will
continue like this and then we'll end until there are
no new infected notes. When there are no new infected
nodes at some time t, because all of the other
nodes that were infected earlier have no opportunity
to infect anyone else, then no one gets to
infect any new nodes and the process naturally ends. Let's start with an example. So let's say we
start at t equals 0 with node A as the
first infected node. That's the seed node. At t equals 1 A will attempt
to infect its neighbors. So nodes B, D, and E will be possibly infected and each of them will be infected with a
different probability. So B would be infected
with a 0.2 probability, D will be infected with
a 0.3 probability, and E will be infected
with a 0.2 probability, and let's say that only D gets infected and B and E do not. Now at t equals 2, the newly infected nodes, namely D here will try to
infect their neighbors. So node C, E, and G will potentially
become infected next. Let's say that both C and
G become infected now. So at time t equals 3, then newly infected nodes C and G will try to
infect their neighbors. Again, the probability
of infection here is changing all the
time it depends on the probability next to the edge and so let's say that now
node f gets infected. Now that F is infected
at t equals 4, F will try to infect its
non-infected neighbors. So node E will potentially become infected and let's say
that it actually fails. E does not become infected
and because there weren't no new infected
notes after this round, then the cascade
terminates and we end with just 5 nodes who
are infected and 3 nodes who are not
infected As you can see, the independent
cascade model is very simple and you can
see how it allows for some mathematical analysis
to understand how it plays out networks and you
can actually do some of that. But at the same time
it's a bit more general than the other
models we had seen. In particular is a
bit more general than the SIR model, because again, we have the possibility
of attaching a probability to every
single one of our edges. So we don't have
just one parameter that controls infection rate, we have that each edge in the
network can have their own. Of course, you could
imagine that you could make the model
even more general. For example, rather than letting every node have just
one opportunity of infected their neighbors. You could imagine that we can do something like we did
in the SIR model, where at every step, every node may have a
probability of becoming removed with some probability
and in that case, not all the nodes
have just one shot, but the number of shots or the length of the infection
can vary node by node. You can also imagine that you
could generalize this model by actually allowing
the probabilities on the edges to change over time. So if a node has been
infected for awhile, maybe the probability
that it infects its neighbors starts
to decay slowly. There are many ways in which we can generalize this model. But the basic independent
cascade model provides a simple starting point for more advanced and
more interesting models. In the next video, we're going to discuss
the other model that is widely used in computer science to understand diffusion on social networks, and that is the linear
threshold model. So we'll see you in that video.
