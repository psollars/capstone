Hello. In the last video, we looked at the SI model. This was the model
where the nodes always went from
being susceptible to being infected as long as there were reachable from at least
one of the seed nodes. In this video, we're
going to look at a different model
called the SIS model. In the SI model, the one we looked at last time, when a node become infected, it stayed infected forever, and in this new SIS model, we're going to try to relax this assumption
because in reality, people recover from disease or if we're talking about the spread of information or an idea, sometimes they loose
interest in passing information along
to their friends. So at some point, they stop trying
to infect others. In this new model, the SIS model, nodes are going to be only
temporarily infected. At some point, they're going
to become susceptible again, and that's why this
called the SIS model is because the nodes go
from being susceptible, to being infected, and then
back to being susceptible. This is how the model
dynamics play out. We start again with a set
of infected seed nodes, these are the nodes that are infected in the beginning
of the process, they don't need to be
infected by anyone else. Then we're going to again move in iterations and in
every iteration, every infected node will pass the disease to its
susceptible neighbors, again, the nodes that it points
to in a directed network. If we're talking about
an undirected network, then is just a node that it's
connected to by an edge, and it will do this with
probability p as before, so we have a parameter p
as well in this model. Then the next thing it's
going to do is it's going to become susceptible with some probability s. So this model has two
parameters, the parameter p, which tells us the probability of a node infecting each
of its neighbors, and the parameter s, which tells us the
probability that an infected node will go
back to being susceptible. Let's simulate the SIS model, just like we did for the SI
model for five iterations, and we'll do this for
parameters p equals 0.5 and S equals 0.6. We'll choose again
D as the seed node, and we'll do the five
iterations after that. In the first iteration, D will try to infect it's
neighbors with probability 0.5. Again, this would be the nodes E, G, and C are the ones
that D points to. In this case, let's say
that C and E were infected, then the infected nodes will become susceptible
with probability s, which in this case is 0.6. One thing to note here
is that we're not counting E and C as infected yet. The nodes that will become susceptible with
probability s are going to be the nodes that were infected in the
previous iteration. So in this case, only D will maybe become susceptible
and in this case, they do not switch to
the susceptible state. So currently, it's
still infected. Okay, the next iteration,
the infected nodes, currently infected node, C, D, and E will infect their
neighbors with probability 0.5. So they will try
to infect nodes A, B, H, and G, and let's say that in
this case nodes A, B, H, and G all become infected,
which could happen. Now the nodes that were
infected previously, node C, D, and E will become susceptible
with probability 0.6. In this case, let's
say the notes D and E switched from being infected
to being susceptible. Now they turn back to
white in the network. The next iteration, the currently infected nodes will try to infect
their neighbors. So we have currently five infected nodes and they'll all try to
infect their neighbors, and let's say that
in this iteration notes D and E become infected. So now we have all but
one infected node. But of course, the ones
that were infected in the previous stage will
potentially become susceptible. The nodes A, B, C, H, and G will potentially
switch to susceptible state, and let's say that in this case, nodes B, C, H, and G switch to susceptible, so we have three infected
nodes and the four iteration, they try to infect
their neighbors. In this case, B, C, and G potentially
become infected. and let's say that they all
actually become infected, and the three nodes
that were infected in the previous state will potentially switch
to susceptible. Let's say that D and A
switch to susceptible state, at t equals five, the nodes B, C, E, and G will try to infect their neighbors with
probability 0.5, and so this would be the nodes A, D, H, and f, all the ones that are
currently not infected, and let's say that in this case, no new nodes become infected. Then the nodes that were infected will become susceptible
with probability 0.6, and let's say that in this case, node C and G switch to
the susceptible state, and we're done with
our five iterations. Of course, this
could continue for many more iterations,
and in fact, it would continue until at
some point maybe there are no infected nodes that no one else can possibly
become infected again. But until then,
the iterations can continue for a very
long time potentially. Let's look at how
the model parameters impact the cascade size. The cascade size is the
number of infected nodes. Again, we're going to take
node D as a seed node, and we're going to
do 50 iterations. But I'm not going to walk you through all the 50
iterations this time, I'm only going to show you the results from
those 50 iterations. Let's look at parameters p
equals 0.5 and s equals 0.1. In this case, nodes infect their neighbors
with probability 0.5 and then they will become susceptible
with probability 0.1, and here I'm plotting on the
x-axis the iteration number, and on the y-axis, I'm plotting the number
of infected nodes. What you can see is
that the number of infected nodes
increases initially, at some point it gets to eight, which is the size of the network, the number of nodes
in this network. So all the notes are
infected for some time. Then after a while, some nodes go back to its susceptible
stage and again they get infected again
and then they go back to not being infected, so the number of infected
nodes jumps up and down, it goes all the way to
eight, it comes down, it does this thing
where it just cycles from anywhere from
two to eight, right? Now let's see what
happens when we increase the probability that nodes will switch to the
susceptible state. Now what we should expect
to happen is that, it's going to be much
harder for that cascade to linger around eight
or stay very high for very long because the
probability that the nodes are going to switch to the
susceptible state is much larger, and so they don't last
very long up here, and so this is what happened in this one of this iteration. It increases sometimes
it got to six, but immediately, it goes back down and it
gets there again, but then again immediately
goes back down, and again it goes up and down, and then at some point something interesting
happens here, which is that, we get to Zero. At some point, everyone
who was infected became susceptible and there
were no infected nodes. As I was saying
earlier, after that, further iterations are
just going to stay at zero because since
no one is infected, no one can infect anyone else and so the cascade
terminates now. Now let's see what happens
if we increase that s parameter to something
even larger like 0.7, and what we should expect
is that, in this case, we should get to a state of zero much sooner
than we did here. Right. Here, it took about 35 iterations to get
to zero infected nodes, now we should see that it takes fewer iterations
to get there. Indeed that's what happens, we started with
one infected node, we get to three, then two, then one, and then goes to zero, and then of course it stays at zero for the rest
of the iterations. Now of course, these are just instances of particular
iterations that I ran. If you run this on your own, you're going to find
that this can vary, of course, because it's
all probabilistic. But in general, we can
see that there are certain patterns where if you
increase the s parameter, then it's much harder for
a large cascade to occur, and if you increase
the p parameter, then it's much easier for
the cascade to occur. So these parameters control the size of the cascade
and how long they last. In the tutorial and
in your assignment, you're going to get to play
with this different models. You're going to get to see how the different parameters
affect the dynamics of diffusion and things like the cascade size and how
long they last and so on. But what we can see in
this example is that as the probability of switching from infected to
susceptible increases, the cascade terminates
more rapidly. In the next video, we're going
to look at another model, which is called the SIR model, which is going to
assume that no nodes go from the infected state
to a removed states. So after that they can no
longer be infected again.
