The next feature we're going to be looking at in this video, is going to be clustering or the tendency of networks to
contain lots of triangles. First let's talk about
triadic closure. Triadic closure is the
tendency for people who share connections in a social
network to become connected. There are multiple
reasons why you may have triadic closure
in a social network. The first reason might be
a reason of opportunity. If you have two people who have a friend in common or maybe
many friends in common, they're going to have a higher
probability of connecting because they have more
of an opportunity to meet each other
in the first place. Another reason would be that, a person who has two friends who are not yet connected
to each other may have an incentive to introduce those two
people to each other, so they become friends and now the relationships are
easier to manage, because now that three are
friends with each other. From a sociological perspective, there are multiple
reasons why you might expect that people
who have friends in common, have a tendency for
connecting with each other. What we're interested in
from a network perspective, is how to measure this tendency. If you look at a
network like this and you try to predict which are the edges that are going to
arrive to this network next, triadic closure would
tell you to look for those edges that
close triangles. If you're making that prediction, you may think, well, maybe C and D will become friends because they're
both connected to E, or maybe D and H also will become friends because
they're both connected to E, or maybe F and H, or B and F, and so on. The edges that form triangles. But as I said, the question is, how can we measure the prevalence of triadic
closure in the network? Keeping in mind that most of the time we have network data for which we don't have
detailed time information, we don't know exactly
when the edges came in the way that
we simulated here, we don't know that the
edges when they arrived, they were actually
closing triangles. We just have a static
version of the network, and we have to somehow
look at that structure and assess whether there seems to be evidence that triadic
closure is at play. The way we think about that is, basically by looking at whether there are lots of
triangles into network. But there are a few ways that
one can go about measuring triangles depending on the things you would like to control for. Let's look at the different ways that one can think about this. The first one is the idea of local clustering coefficient. The local clustering
coefficient of a node, is the fraction of pairs of the node's friends that are
friends with each other. Note that we're defining this
for a specific node, so, before we think about
the entire network, we're going to
define this measure just on a node by node basis. We're going to take a node, we're going to take the
friends of that node, and we're going to ask out of all of these
friends of this node, what fraction of
them are actually connected to each other? The way that this relates
to triangles is that, if you think about it,
if you have a node and that has to friends, and we're asking whether
those two friends are connected to each other, or if they are connected to each other then a triangle
would be formed. But again, we're doing this on a node by node basis first. Let's practice this
definition by looking at the clustering coefficient
of a few nodes here. Let's compute the local
clustering coefficient of node C. Well, what we're going to
need, is to compute the numerator and the
denominator of this fraction. The numerator of the fraction
is going to be the number of pairs of C's friends who
are friends with each other, and the denominator
is going to be the number of pairs
of C's friends. Let's start with the denominator. The first thing to note, is
that C has four friends, or in other words, the degree of C is 4. There's a useful formula that one can use to go from the degree of a node to the number of
pairs of the node's friends. If we start with the degree of 4, we can get to the
number of pairs of C's friends by
using this formula, the degree of C times a degree
of C minus 1 divided by 2, which is basically the
degree of C choose two, and in this case, that
would give us six. C has six pairs of friends, that is the denominator. Now, the numerator
is the number of pairs of C's friends who are
friends with each other, and in this case,
what we see is that, we have two of those, A and B are connected, and E and F are connected, so, our numerator is two. That means that the local
clustering coefficient of C is going to be
one-third or 2 over 6. Let's go through another example. Let's look at the local
clustering coefficient of node F. Again, let's compute the numerator and the denominator separately, starting with the denominator. F has three friends and there are three possible
edges among three nodes, so, the number of pairs
of F's Friends is three, and we can see that only one of those are connected
to each other, namely node C and E, and so, the numerator
is going to be one, and so, in total, the clustering coefficient of
F is going to be one-third. Let's do one more that's going to look a
little bit different. That's node J. Let's see
what happens with this one. Again, we have the numerator
and the denominator, but because J has
only one friend, that means that the denominator in this case would be zero. There it's zero pairs
of J's friends. J only has one friend. You're not allowed
to divide by 0, so, our definition here doesn't
work, is undefined. What we're going to
do in this case, is we're going to define the local clustering
coefficient of a node that has degree
less than two to be zero. This is again the local
clustering coefficient and is local because we're computing
it on a node by node basis. We're not saying anything
about the entire network yet, we're just computing this
for each and every node. Now, how do we go from the local version of the
clustering coefficient to a global version that measures
in the entire network? What is the likelihood
for triangles to appear? This would be the global
clustering coefficient. There are basically two
ways that we can do this. The first one is very simple, we just take the average of the local
clustering coefficient over all of the
nodes in the graph and that's our global
clustering coefficient, which is a very
common measurement. But there's another
measure that we can apply, which is known as transitivity. What it is, is the percentage of open triads that are
triangles in a network. Rather than measuring
something local and then averaging over
the local measure, we're going to directly ask, how many open triads
are actually triangles, are actually closed triads? In this case, what we're
going to do is we're going to say that
triangles look like this, we have three nodes that are
all connected to each other and an open triad is going to be a structure like
this, what do we have? Three nodes but only two edges. One thing to note is that if we just have one single triangle, this triangle will contain
three open triads. Would be this open triad with this two edges,
this would be, there's another open triad with these two edges and then another open triad with these two edges. Our transitivity
measure is going to reflect that three
and it's going to be 3 times the number of close triads divided
by the number of open triads or 3
times the number of triangles divided by the
number of open triads. These are the two
ways that we can go about measuring clustering in a network or global version
of clustering in a network. In general, they tend to be
correlated with each other. If we compare transitivity, we're just taking the average local
clustering coefficient but there could be differences. Let me try to explain to you how those
differences come about. Both of them measure
the tendency for edges to form triangles but what's going to happen is that
transitivity weights nodes with larger degree higher. If we have a node that has very high degree and
it happens to have a high clustering
coefficient then transitivity is probably going
to end up being very high. Let's look at an example. First of all, the node
here in the middle has a small local clustering
coefficient and that's because while some pairs of the friends of the node in the middle are indeed connected, most pairs are not, so you have these two
edges here which are not connected and so on. The local clustering coefficient of this node in the
middle is going to be low and this is the
node with high degree. Whereas the nodes out here are going to have a very high local
clustering coefficient. Each of them has two friends, and in every case they are
connected to each other. So all of these have local
clustering coefficient of one. When you think about the average clustering
coefficient in this graph, what you get is that, because most of them
have a value of one and only one
has a small value, the average is going to be high. However, when we think
about transitivity well, transitivity doesn't really do these node by node measurement, it just directly goes out and
looks at all of the triads. In this network there are
many open triads that are not closed and there are a few there closed but most of them
are actually not closed. So transitivity in this
network is going to be low. You can see how
transitivity weights the nodes with large
degree higher because nodes with high degree are going to create many more triads. If they happened to be closed, then the value would be high
but if they happened to be opened and the value for
transitivity would be low. Let's summarize what we
see in this network, we have that most nodes have a high local clustering
coefficient and the high degree node has a low local clustering
coefficient. We are defining this case is that the average clustering
coefficient is pretty high at 0.93 whereas it transitivity
is much lower at 0.23. You can construct
the opposite example in the following way, so look at this network. In this network we have that the low degree nodes have a very low local
clustering coefficients, so all of these nodes here have local clustering
coefficient of zero but they also have
a very low degree. Whereas the nodes in
the middle here have a very high local
clustering coefficient as well as a high degree
relative to the other nodes. In this network, most nodes have a low local clustering
coefficient the once outside there are more of those and the
high degree nodes have high local
clustering coefficient. What happens in this
network is that the trend is reversed. You have an average clustering coefficient
that's low because most nodes have a low local
clustering coefficient but the transitivity is high because the high
degree nodes have a high local
clustering coefficient and they generate a lot of
triads that are closed. In summary, we saw that the clustering coefficient
measures the degree to which nodes in a network tend to cluster or form triangles. We talked about the local version of the clustering coefficient, which is going to be
applied on a node by node basis as well as
a couple of ways of measuring this at a global scale for a single number for
the entire network. For their local
clustering coefficient, we defined it as the fraction of pairs of the node's friends
are friends with each other. You take a node, look at all of the friends and look at all pairs of friends and ask
what fraction of them are connected by an edge. In this case, for example, we saw that node C had a local clustering
coefficient of one-third. Then when we think about how
to aggregate all of this for a global version of the
measure then we saw two ways. One was to simply average the local clustering coefficient
over all of the notes. The other one was transitivity, which would measure the ratio of the number of triangles and
the number of open triads. We saw that the transitivity puts larger weight on nodes
that have high degree. Just like with the other
measures that we've been looking at like this things
and degree distributions. Next week we're
going to be thinking about models that can also explain the levels of clustering that we
see in real networks, which in general is very high. So we'll see you
in those lectures.
