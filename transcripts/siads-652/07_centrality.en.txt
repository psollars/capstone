Hello. So far we have
discussed distance, degree distributions
as well as clustering. In this video we're
going to discuss how to find important
nodes in a network. This is the topic of
networks centrality. Let's look at the
karate club network that we have looked at before. Let's think about this network. If you had to guess which were the most important
nodes in this network, just purely based on the
structure of the network, which one would they be? I know this is a hard question
because there are probably many different ways
that you could think about answering this question. Many different ways about
thinking about importance. For example, we can
think of importance as the number of friends that a node has or the node's degree. If we go by this measure, the five most important
nodes are the following; 34, 1, 33, 3, and 2. However, we could argue that importance is not really about
how many friends you have, but more about how close you are to everyone else
in the network. It really should be
based on proximity, not on the row number
of connections. If we go by proximity, then the most important
nodes are; 1, 3, 34, 32, and 9. It changes a little bit. Instead of 33, we now have nine, and instead of two, we now have 32. We could also imagine that we define importance
based on whether or not a node shows up in between shortest
paths of other nodes. You could define it
as the fraction of shortest paths that
pass through the node. If you do that, then again, this list of the five most important nodes
shifts a little bit. Now we have 1, 34, 33, 3, and 32. You can see that depending on exactly how you
define importance, you get some changes, although most of the nodes
actually stay the same. The goal for this video and for the next couple of videos is to carefully go through different ways that people
have thought about centrality, about measuring
importance in networks and think about the
assumptions that they make. Networks centrality is an important problem
because it can help us do a lot of
things in the real world. For example, it helps us identify nodes that are
influential in social networks, like for example in
social media networks, it helps us identify
nodes that can disseminate a lot of
information to other nodes very quickly or they
can help us prevent epidemics by making sure that those nodes are
not spreading it. In transportation networks,
it can help us figure out what the hubs of a particular
transportation network are, like in the case of airports. In the case of the web, centrality measures like this, is exactly one of
the ingredients that helps us figure out what
important pages are. Is one of the main
ingredients that helps Google figure out which pages should be placed high in the ranking when they serve pages to you
after you issue a query. Centrality can also
help us figure out which nodes prevent the entire
network from breaking up. That is if we were to remove
some nodes from the network, which ones would cause
the network to fragment into multiple
components and so on. There are many applications that this idea of centrality has. There are also a lot of different measures
that one can use. Here I'm listing a few
of them and we're going to be talking about some
of these in this course. In this video we're going to
talk about the first two, degree centrality and
closeness centrality. Let's start with
degree centrality, which is probably the
most basic one of all. The assumption is that important nodes are those
that have many connections. Depending on the type of
network we're looking at, we can define it differently. For example in the case
of undirected networks, we would use degree. But in the case of
directed networks, we can either use
in-degree or out-degree, just like we did for a
degree distributions. Let me define this
more precisely. What we're going to do is
we're going to say that the degree centrality of
node v is going to be d_v, which is the degree of
v divided by N minus 1, where N is the number of
nodes in the network. In other words
we're going to ask, what fraction of the nodes in the network are connected
to this node v? The reason why we have N
minus one instead of N, is that we expect that the node v is not
connected to itself. It's really N minus
one other nodes that are available for
v to connect to. This measure would go from 0-1, zero would be the
case where the node has no connections and one would be the case
where the node is connected to all the
other notes into network. For example, Node 34
here has 17 connections, has degree 17 and there
are 34 nodes into network. The degree centrality of node
34 is 17 over 33 or 0.52. For 33, this is 0.36. If we look at directed networks, as I said now we
can choose whether we apply the in-degree
or the out-degree. This is the in-degree version so that in-degree
centrality of node v is now the in-degree of v
divided by N minus 1. For example, if we
look at node A, A has an in-degree of two and there are 15
nodes into network, so the in-degree
centrality of node A is going to be 2 over 14 or 0.14. For L, It's going to be 3 over 14 because L has
an in-degree of three. If we change to the out-degree, now we're counting outgoing edges instead of incoming edges. Now, A has an out-degree
of 3 over 14, because it has three
outgoing edges. While L has an out-degree of 1 over 14 because it
only has one outgoing edge. Let's talk about the
second centrality measure, which is closeness centrality. The assumption of closeness
centrality is that important nodes are
close to other nodes. The way we're going to define
closeness centrality for a node v is that we're
going to take N- 1, which is all of the
nodes in the network, minus the one we're
looking on, minus V, that's in the numerator, and in the denominator, what we're going to do
is we're going to add up the distances from node v
to all of the other nodes. So we take the sum over u in N, the set of nodes in
the network minus V, we're not going to look at
the distance from v to v, and then we add up the
distance from v to u. So here d, v, u is the distance between the a new based on the length of the
shortest path and so effectively what we're
doing is we're taking one over the average distance from node v to all the other
nodes in the network. In this case, for example, node 32 has a closeness
centrality measure of 0.541. Again, this measure is
also between zero and one. Now one of the things that we're implicitly assuming is that, this node v can reach all of the other nodes in the
network and if it cannot, then this number will be infinity and then it will be unclear what
the centrality is. We could define it to be zero, but that doesn't work very well. Let's see what happens
when you have nodes that maybe cannot reach all of the
other nodes in the network. This often happens with
directed networks because now we have to actually respect
the direction of the edges. Although it could happen
in undirected networks as well if you have
multiple components. How to measure the closest
centrality of a node when it cannot reach all of the other nodes, what
do we do in that case? Let's take L as a running example to discuss our options here. One option is to consider only the nodes that
L can actually reach and just follow the same
computation that we followed for the previous
way we measured it. What we will do is
we'd say, okay, the closeness centrality of L is going to be in the numerator, rather than having N-1, we're going to just
have R over L, which is how many nodes can
this node actually reach. In the denominator, instead of taking the sum over all of
the nodes into the network, we're only going to take it over the nodes that L
can actually reach. So we'll take the
sum over u in RL, and then we'll add
up the distance from L to each of those u's, and so what would happen
here, for example, is that L actually can only reach node M. You can see
that if we go from L to M, M has no outgoing edges, so we're stuck there, and so L cannot reach
anyone else other than M. So if we
follow these option, then we're going to have
is that R of L is just M, so the numerator is one and the distance from L to M is one, so the closeness centrality of L is just one over
one, which is one. But that seems strange
because that would say that L is a
very central node, and just by looking at
it, it really isn't. It can only reach
one of the node, how can we say that
is very central? So this is too high
of a centrality for L and so this option
is not so great. But there's another
option we have, which is to consider only
the nodes that L can reach and then normalize by the fraction of nodes
that L can reach, so we follow the same procedure. We only measure the distance from L to the nodes that L can reach, but then we penalize L for only being able to
reach one of the nodes, so this is how it would work. We would say that the
closest centrality of L is going to be the same
term we had before, where we have in the numerator, the number of nodes
that L can reach, in the denominator, the sum over the distances from L to all of the nodes
that L can't reach, so we don't have any
infinite terms there, but then we have an
additional term here, which is the fraction of RL
or the number of nodes in RL. How many nodes L can reach
divided by n minus one, so what fraction of all
of the nodes L can reach? What this gives us is, well we already know this
term is one over one, but this term now is one
over 14 because L can only reach one of the 14
other nodes into network, and so now the centrality
of L is much lower, 0.071. This is the one that we would
probably use in practice. One thing to note here is
that this definition matches our definition of
closeness centrality when a graph is connected, because when a
graph is connected, then the set of nodes that a node can reach will
be the same as N - 1. Since by definition,
in a connected graph, a node should be able to
reach all of the other nodes. This would be
strongly connected in the case of a directed network. Okay, so let's summarize
what we have so far. We looked at two
centrality measures and we're going to be
looking at more of them, but we're starting
with just these two. We looked at degree centrality, which assumes that important
nodes have many connections, and we define it this way, is going to be the degree
of the node over N - 1. Where n is the number of
nodes in the network and then we looked at
Closeness Centrality, which assumes that important
nodes are those that are close to other nodes
in network distance. The way we define it is
using this formula here, so we look at the nodes
that a node can reach. We measure the sum
of the distances, take one over the
average of that, and then we penalize a node if it cannot reach all of
the nodes in the network. That's this term right
here or we don't penalize for the nodes
that a node cannot reach, but then we can get strange
scores for some nodes, as we saw in the case of L. Okay, and that's all for this video. In the next video we're
going to be looking at another way of defining
centrality so I'll see you there.
