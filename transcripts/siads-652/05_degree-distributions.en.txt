Hello. We have been expanding our vocabulary that we use
to talk about networks, and we have also
been learning about the different features
that networks have. For example, in the last video, we were looking at distance. We saw that if we take a random pair of
nodes in a network, you're likely to find
that on average, these two nodes are a short distance away
from each other. If we look at the shortest
path between the nodes, you don't have to
hop that many times to get from one
node to the other. Today we're going to
be thinking about the number of connections that nodes have and how this number is distributed over
the entire network. This is the topic of
degree distributions. Let's first define
the degree of a node. The degree of a node in an undirected graph is the number of neighbors
that the node has. Let's take this toy network here, and let's write down the degree of each of the nodes
in this network. Node A here has degree three because it's connected
to three other nodes, namely nodes H, G, and B. Whereas for example, node E has degree one because it's connected
to just one other node. Sometimes we're not interested in looking at the degree
of a particular node, sometimes we want to know how these degrees are distributed
over the entire network, and that's a degree distribution. The degree distribution
of a graph is the probability distribution of the degrees over
the entire network. If we name the
degree distribution, P of k, of this
particular network, it would have the
following values, where P of k is the fraction of nodes that have degree k. Well, P of 1 would be the fraction
of nodes that have degree 1, and in this case, this value
would be one over nine, because there's only one node, namely node E, that
has degree one, and there are a
total of nine nodes. Whereas for example, P of 3, which is the fraction of
nodes that have degree 3, is three over nine, or one-third, because there are
three nodes that have degree 3: nodes A, F and C. Oftentimes, particularly for large networks, we're not really
interested in looking at the specific values
for each integer, or for each value in
the distribution, but we want to look at the shape of the
entire distribution, so we want to visualize it. Again, this is most interesting
for large networks. For a small network like this, this plot is not going to
look that interesting, but we can produce it
anyways. Here it is. This is the degree
distribution of this node. Basically, what you
can see is that a few nodes have
very small degree, a few nodes have
very large degree, relatively speaking, and most nodes are
somewhere in the middle. We can also talk about
degrees in directed graphs, but now we have to split
our degrees into two types. We have the in-degree
and out-degree. The in-degree is going to be, how many nodes point
to this specific node? The out-degree is going to be, how many nodes does
the node point to? Let's just look at in-degree
for this directed graph. The in-degree of node
A is going to be three because it has three
other nodes that point to it. Whereas for example, node D has in-degree one because it only has one node
that points to it. Note that there is another
edge that points from D to C, but this one is
not counted in the in-degree of D because it's pointing away from D not towards D. Just like we did for a degree, we can produce the
in-degree distribution. Let's call it P_n
of k. In this case, you would have that P_n of zero, the fraction of nodes that have in-degree zero is two over nine, because there are two nodes
that no one points to, node E and node H. The P_n of 2, the fraction of nodes that have in-degree 2 is going to be two or nine since there two
nodes that have in-degree 2. Like I said, we can do
the exact same thing for out-degree and it would
be a little different. The values would change a little, but it's the same concept, so I'm going to skip that. For in-degree, we can also plot the distribution and it
would look like this. Again, these are
mostly interesting for very large networks and we'll see some real plots of degree distributions
for real networks next. What do these degree
distributions look like in real networks? I'm going to show
you three examples, and these are the
degree distributions for the examples I'm
going to show you, but let me first tell you
what the networks are. The first network is
a network of actors. There are about 225,000 of them. We're going to
connect every pair of actors with an edge if they have appeared
together in a movie. We'll create a network
in that way and we can see each of the actors, how many neighbors they have? How many others they
have appeared with? We can plot the
distribution of that. The second one is the
network of the web, where we're taking 325,000
documents and we're connecting them when
there is a URL that points from one
document to the other. In that case, we're
looking at the in-degree since that's a directed network, because the URLs
have a direction, they come from somewhere and they point to somewhere else. Then the last network is a
network of the US power grid. You have about 5,000 generators that are connected
by transmission lines. These are the corresponding plots of the degree distribution. Two things to note
in these plots, the first one is that they
are all in a log-log scale. What that means is that the x-axis and the y-axis
are not in a linear scale, they don't go 1,
2, 3, 4 and so on, they go, 10 to a zero, 10 to a one, 10 to
a two and so on. The second thing to note is
that these distributions, at least for part of
the distribution, look like straight lines
in this log-log scale. What does that imply? Well, when degree distributions look
like a straight line, when they're on a log-log scale, what it means or what it suggests is that they may be a power law, or at least they're
similar to a power law. What I mean by a power law, is that the P of k value, the fraction of nodes
that have degree k, follows the function C times
k to the negative Alpha, for Alpha and C constant. What it means is that if you
think about what happens to the fraction of nodes that
have degree k, as k increases, the fraction is
going to decrease, but it's not going to
decrease exponentially fast, like for example, how it would if this was a normal
distribution. It's going to decrease
slowly enough that while most of the nodes are
going to have small degree, there will be a
few nodes that are going to accumulate huge, huge degree, relatively speaking. Let's look at the networks
and see what this implies. In the actor network, what we have is that
most of the nodes have a relatively small
number of connections. They've appeared
with tens of actors, but there are a few
actors that have appeared with a very large
number of actors, like 100s or 1,000 actors. These are orders of
magnitude of difference. In the second network of the web, what do we have is that
most documents only get pointed by a few other documents, maybe 10, 20 or so. But there are a few that have a bunch of documents
that point to them, like 1,000s of them. Same thing for the US power grid. Most generators have just a few connections
through transmission lines, but there are a few
that have many of them. The existence of these few nodes that have such high connectivity, such high degree, is
important for many reasons. For example, in social networks, what we have is that there
are a few people that are so very well-connected that they can have very high
influence, or for example, in the case of the US power grid, you have some
generators that have so many connections that
if they were to fail, then this would create a big problem in the
entire US power grid. Same thing when you think
about transportation networks. If you have a few airports
that have orders of magnitude, more connections
than other airports, they really hold up the network together and if
they were to fail, if there were to be closed
or something like that, then they would create big
problems for transportation. This inequality in the degrees of the nodes has
real-world consequences. In particular, what we're
going to be thinking about in the following week
of the course is, can we think of models, that with very simple rules, can explain why a network may have a distribution like this. The same thing that I
said about distance, we're going to be thinking about models that can explain to us why nodes have short
distance from each other. We're going to do
the same thing for this issue of degree
distributions. Can we come up with models with very simple rules
that can help us understand why it
might be the case that networks look like this?
