Hello. In this video, we're going to begin with a very basic definition
of what a network is, and then I'm going to
try to convince you that studying networks
is a good idea. Let's begin with the definition. A network or a graph is a representation of connections
among sets of items. Those items are called
the nodes or the vertices and the connections are called the edges or links, or sometimes we call them ties. In this figure, we can see
an example of a network. The nodes are simply
labeled by letters and then lines that connect any two
circles are the edges. One of the things to
keep in mind is that when we visualize
networks like this, all we care about is who
is connected to whom? We don't really care about how far the circles are
from each other. In other words, I could take this node D and drag
it really far away, let's say all the way here. As long as D is simply
connected to E, it doesn't really matter
that it's all the way over here or where actually is. That's something to
be careful about when we visualize networks. The location of the nodes
and how long the edges are, typically carry no meaning. All we care about is
who's connected to who. Why do we study
structures like this? I'm going to give
you two reasons. The first reason
is the following, networks are not something new. In particular, people have been studying social networks
for a long time. Here are two examples of networks that people
have looked at. One in the 1970s and
one in the 1930s. The one on the left is a
network that represents friendships between the
members of a karate club. In this does network you have node number 1 as
the instructor of the club and node number 34 as the assistant of the
instructor in the club. There's an interesting
story behind this network that I will
tell you about later. The network on the right is a network of friendship
in a first-grade class, which was studied in the '30s. Something that both of
these networks have in common is that
they're small enough such that we can look at the network and start to
see features about it. In the karate club network, we can see that the
instructor has lots of friends and also
that the assistant has lots of friends and that there is no
friendship between the instructor and the assistant and so maybe there's something interesting
going on there. Anyway, there are a lot
of things that we can look at in these networks
and make sense of. However, now that we have very large datasets and we can study networks that
are much larger scale, things look a little different. What happens when we try to visualize these networks
is the following, here's a network on the
left of the World Wide Web, and on the right is a network
of people who were arrested in Chicago and two people are connected whenever they're
arrested together. What you can see is that when you try to visualize these networks, you basically cannot say
anything meaningful. You cannot say anything about the structure of these networks by simply looking at them. This is one reason why we need techniques such as
statistical analysis, models, algorithms that can help us take this very large structures
and make sense of them. That's reason number one.
Reason number 2 for why we want to study networks
is that they're everywhere. What I'm going to do
next is I'm going to show you a number
of examples to try to convince you that if you learn how to study networks, you can apply these techniques to many different settings. Let's begin with social networks. In social networks, we try to capture relationships
between people. We already saw one
example of this. This was the friendship
network in the karate club. Here's a network of
e-mail communication among 436 employees of HP, and there is a connection between any two employees whenever
they email each other, so we can begin to look at who talks to whom in
this organization. Finally, here is a
network of friendship, marital tie, and family
tie among 2,200 people. These are social network. Networks can also help us understand transportation
systems and mobility. Here's a very simple example of Ann Arbor bus
transportation network. We could represent
this map by connecting any two stops that are connected
by a direct bus route. Here is a network
that can help us understand mobility
patterns in the US and the data for
this network comes from how dollar bills
move around the country. This is using data from a
website called Where's George? Where people can go in, type in the serial
number of a bill and tell the website where
the bill currently is, and then other people who whenever they get
this bill can go and do the same thing and they can see where the bill has been. Because in order to move one bill from location A to a location B, a person usually will have
to transport that bill, then this is a proxy
for human mobility. One interesting thing
you see here is that the network resembles the US map. But this is only your
imagination because this is all simply just where the
bills are going to and from. But of course there's
a connection between the two and so you can see that the major cities
light up and that the general shape of the network cannot
resembles the US map. This can help us understand mobility patterns of
people in the country. Here's a network of direct
flights around the world so we connect any two airports
that have a direct flight. Again, we can see here
that the world map shows up when we
plot this network. Network can also tell us
about information systems. Here's a famous
example where someone took a lot of different blogs and somewhere left-wing blogs and somewhere right-wing blogs and they made each blog a node. Then a connection between the two nodes would
happen if there is a hyperlink that connects
one blog to another blog. One of the interesting things
you can see here by just visualizing the network is that there is hyper-polarization. Left-wing blogs mainly linked
to other left-wing blogs, and right-wing blogs mainly link to other right-wing blogs, and there in a lot of
connections that connect one blog from the left to one block to the
right or vice versa. Here's a network of the
internet connectivity, so here you have routers, and the connections represents which router is connected
to what router. Here's a network of Wikipedia articles
about climate change. One of the things you see
here is that there are different subtopics that are connected together
and they're colored. I don't need for
you to be able to actually see any of those labels. What I'm trying to show
you here is simply that within a topic of
Wikipedia articles, there are subgroups
within that topic. Again, the connections
here represent hyperlinks between the
Wikipedia articles. One of the things that
we'll be thinking about later in the class is, here is a network,
just one network. How do we identify those subgroups or its
sub-communities that might represent those subtopics within the topic of climate change? That's one of the applications that we'll be talking
about later on. Networks also show up in biology. Here is a protein-protein
interaction network, and studying this
network can help us understand which proteins
are very important, very central in the network, and even what
functions they have. Here is another network which
is showing us a food web, which animals eat which animals, which again can be
studied to understand different patterns about the
structure of who eats whom. I could continue with
many other examples. There are financial networks,
co-authorship networks, trade networks, citation
networks, and on and on. The idea is that if we
learn how to analyze, and how to study networks into different techniques that
we can apply to them. Those tools can be very useful because they
could be applied to a broad range of different
settings and domains, and so that's reason
number two for why we want to study
this networks. Networks are everywhere, but
what can we do with them? What are the applications
that I have in mind that maybe we can play around or think about in this course? Well, let's go back to this
e-mail communication network among the HP employees. What are interesting
questions we could ask about this network? Well, for example, if a rumor
starts in this network, is it likely to spread? Can we say something about the likelihood of
a rumor spreading and does network just looking at the structure of
who talks to whom? Or for example, if we're interested in figuring
out who should be the initial spreaders of that rumor so that it
spreads very widely? How do I pick the nodes
to spread the rumor? Or maybe it's not a
rumor or maybe I'm thinking about a norm
within the company and I want to contact a few people to begin spreading this norm through
e-mail communication. How do I pick this nodes? Who should be on
nodes that I choose? In other words, who are the
most influential people in this organization or at least in this subset of
the organization? Here's again, the
friendship network and I told you there's an
interesting story about it. The story is the following, we have the instructor
here, as I said, node number one and the assistant of the
instructor, just node 34, and you can see there is no
edge between the two and that's because they're
actually not friends anymore. They had a big fight and they
broke up their friendship. Now the assistant is thinking about starting their
own karate club, and one of the things
that you could try to guess based on the
structure of this network is, where are the
students going to go? Which ones are going to stay with the original instructor and which ones are going to
follow the assistant? That goes back to the topic
of here's one network, how do we find subgroups or sub-communities
within this network? What happens here
is that there is a clear cut around
the middle here where the nodes to the left of this cut go with the assistant, whereas the nodes to the right of this cut go to
originally structure. Again, this is one of the topics we'll
study in this course. Is this club likely to
split into two groups? That's something we
can think about, and if so, which nodes
will go to which group? Let's go think about the
transportation network again. Here's a network of direct
flights around the world. Let's imagine that
we're worried about a particular virus
spreading around the world, and we're thinking
about which airports do we really have to protect? Which airports are
going to be very important to protect
because it could be Hobbs that will spread the
virus all over the place? Well, that's the network question that asks about centrality. Which ones are very central, very close to others? How do we think
about that question? Maybe there are certain parts of the world that are
very hard to reach and were interested in
figuring out which edges, in other words, which airports
should we try to connect strategically so that those areas are no longer very hard to reach. That's another application
we can think about. In summary, many
complex structures can be modeled through networks. We can see how these things
show up all over the place, and there's structures that
are very large and very complicated sometimes
when we visualize them, we cannot make any sense of them. Studying the
structures can help us understand interesting
phenomena in the real world. But in order to do that, we need the right techniques that can help us do these things, and that's what we hope to
give you in this course. Some of the very
basic techniques that can get you started
thinking about networks, and if you have network data, what can you actually do with it? What interesting
questions you can answer? I look forward to the course, and this is all for this video.
