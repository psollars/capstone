One of the harder
problems to solve in machine learning
is around image, and label recognition
within the image. What is actually in the image, this is a really easy
thing for a human to do. We can look at an image, and instantly know what's
happening in there. It's really hard to train
a computer to do that. If you are given the
business requirement to do, to find labels in images, you can build a model, you can go down the effort
of doing it by hand, nothing stops you from going
through that approach, but it's a time-consuming task, and you're not going
to get close to what Amazon is able to do. Let's talk about Amazon's
recognition platform today. This is the web interface to it. I do the demonstration
in the web interface, but ultimately, I access
this with an API, I want to access this
programmatically, and so for your homework, you will be using an API to access amazon's
recognition platform, but I want to talk about
what this is able to do. First of all, Amazon has a set of labels that
they have trained for, and it's telling you
over here that you can download the entire list
of labels that they have. It's also telling you in this nice blue box
over here that, if you want to build
custom labels, if your business has unique things that you are
trying to find an images, it's better to use
their infrastructure, and build a custom
model on top of it, than to try to build
this from scratch. I've got some images,
I'll run it through here. These are some random
images I put together, there's a person
working on a computer, you can see they're
in the server room, and what this comes back
with is person, and human. I'm not quite sure what the difference is
between a person, and a human, I assume that
all people are humans, and all humans are persons, but you'll also see
that Amazon gave it the same percentage
accuracy on both. Computer keyboard with 97
percent accuracy keyborad, I do get this one,
not all keyboards are computer keyboards. It's identifying a
computer in here, and it's seeing electronics, and if we scroll down here, we can get down to some
things that may or may not be accurate, clothing, well, technically, yes, sitting, no, actually, there is no
sitting occurring in here. There is a table, and
there is furniture, and computer hardware, some
of these are accurate. Typically, if you stay to the top three or four
recognize labels, you're going to be pretty
close to being accurate. Let's do another image here,
we'll upload this one. That image is too large,
let's upload my last one. A maximum size of
about five megabytes, this is a rat holding
some balloons, and it's not very good here. It got the balloon, you can see why it's
thinking this is a cat, definitely an animal, a mammal. If we scroll down here,
it's probably not a pet, so it's not perfect, but it did figure
out the balloons. One of the things
that's nice about this, when you run it, is it gives you the
labels that it finds, but when you actually
look at the JSON that it's returning
behind the scenes, it's giving you its
confidence intervals, and it's also giving you all the detail from
within here, name, high-rise, city, urban building as part of the
parent items around this. It's also giving you the version that it's using to do this work. Amazon recognition is this
really simple thing to do, you basically send it a request, and in this case it's an S3
object that you're saying, hey, go analyze this object, if we upload an image. I think it actually
drops it in S3 as well. If you upload an image, let's see where
it's putting this, it actually put it in raw, but you upload an image, you point recognition to it, and you get a prediction. They've built some
custom models, as you can imagine
around PPE detection, and so what this is saying is, does this person have the appropriate personal
protection equipment, a mask, hands, and head. In this instance, they've
got a head cover, they've got a mask, and
they've got gloves on, and if you look at
the actual labels for every person that's in
the image you upload, it's giving you it's confidence intervals
including this one which is probably
a COVID response, face cover on nose. Let's go back to the person
working in the server room, if we route this through it, the image is too large. Well, it's not
going to take that, puts the rat work, we'll see if we can send the rat to it. I'm going to guess
that's too large too, so it's really
looking for images. Now, you may ask,
well, wait a minute, why is this too large, that's a great question. This API is probably
designed to be used with video frames so
that you can send video frames to it in real-time. Amazon recognition has an
entire video analysis tool where you can actually
give it a video file, and it will tell
you what happens within the video file,
who the people are, the objects,
everything around it, where you can go through, and sort them out. Here's audience, and we can see that our audience is, well, the panel as an audience, and so you can filter through what it's
doing in real time. Amazon recognition
is a wonderful tool. It should be one of the tool sets that is in your tool belt, and so you will
have some homework related to it this
week. Thank you.
