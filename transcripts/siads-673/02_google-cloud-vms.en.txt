So I'd like to take a look
at the Google console. And this is a Google project
that I'm running for some covid related response stuff. And we're going to take a look
through kind of how this works and how it's a little bit
different from Amazon. So this is the front page
of the Google console. Google has all of their services
in this hamburger menu here. And we spend most of our time
in the compute engine service, this is the equivalent to EC2. And as we've spun up instances in EC2
creating an instance in Amazon space or I'm sorry, and
Google space is pretty easy. We'll go ahead and say create instance and
it's going to give us this default name of instance, one, I'm going to
just call this demo instance and then we can go through and we can
configure how we're going to do this. It's very,
very similar to what we do with EC2. We choose our region,
this would be Amazon's availability zone. We can choose where we want to put this. Just like Amazon, there is
a Northern Virginia Google zone and then we can choose what
zone we want to put it in. So just like Amazon,
we've got availability regions and zones within them. And then we've got our instance types. And so,
just like with AWS we've got the smaller instance types here,
I don't want that small though. And it's going to come up and
tell us what our cost is, obviously as we change this,
in theory tells us that it's changed. So that dropped it down to 799. This is actually a nice
feature over Amazon. Amazon when you're spinning up
an instance, it doesn't tell you what the cost is, you've gotta go to
another page to calculate that. In some services it does,
but not all of them. If we change our instance types around,
we make this a little bit larger, we can see that price
changes in real time. I personally like this a lot better than
Amazon because it lets me know what I'm going to be spending prior to having to
like go to different pages and do it. We can scroll down here. A lot of things here are buried in a menu. Amazon has this nice wizard
that it walks you through. This isn't quite the same here,
but ultimately, we tell it we're going to create it and we give it a minute
and it will then spin up a demo instance. And one of the cooler features with
Google cloud is the ability to log in directly through the web interface. And Amazon kind of does this, it's not nearly as nice as
how Google Cloud handles it,. But, this will take it a minute
to actually be ready for use, but now we can see that we've got
our internal IP or external IP. But, we can say hey how do we
want to connect to this instance? And we can just click right here and we've gotta say yes and it is
going to take it a second to do this. There's an Amazon service that
makes this a little bit cleaner. I'm sorry, Google service that makes us
a little bit cleaner but it is taking our ssh keys that Google has created and
putting them directly into the VM for us. If you remember on the Amazon side, we had
to create those key pairs and import it. Google kind of automates this
whole process and in a second. Okay, maybe a little bit
longer than a second. It will actually log us
into that virtual machine. While that's going on over here,
I'm going to come back over here and just show some of the other things
that you're able to do in here. Just like Google, there is a firewall and
a networking component in here. They keep that under the VPC networks and in here, you can specify the firewall. I did not mean to click on that. Sorry about that. The firewalls for
Google are a little bit different in that it's all tag based or
it's mostly tag based. And this appears to be taking a long time. We're going to restart that and
see if it goes a little faster. It's all tag based. And so what you do is you write
a firewall rule in here and you then specify the tags
that it applies to. I actually think that Amazon's way
of handling this is a lot easier to understand. But, it works for
everybody in the same manner. Some people prefer this,
I prefer the other one. But in the end,
they all do similar things. And just like in the AWS space, we can
terminate our instances in the same way, we can stop an instance or
we can delete the instance which is in a different we're going to
go in here to do that. So we can permanently delete the instance. Ultimately, they all do
the same thing in the end, they all are providing that basic compute
network and storage functionality. I don't know why this isn't working,
I think there may be a security policy I have on this account that is
preventing that from happening, but if you spin up your own Google cloud
account, that cloud button will work. Yeah, it does give you the syntax here
of how to log in using another client if you want to use a direct client, but,
if you do do this in your instance, it will work this account has some
policies on that, so sorry about that. But, yeah,
that's how you spin up an EC2 or a Google cloud compute terminology
is going to kill me today. A Google cloud compute instance and
how you delete it when you're done. Thank you.
