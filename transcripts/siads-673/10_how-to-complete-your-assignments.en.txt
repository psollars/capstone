For this class, we're using a hosted
environment known as Vocareum. I'm going to give a quick overview of
how Vocareum works within this class. What you're seeing here is
the student view for Vocareum, and there's a couple of things to take note. Obviously in the middle of this
there is a Jupiter notebook and you're all familiar with how
Jupiter notebooks work, so I'm not going to discuss
the intricacies of how Jupiter works. Across the top you've got some controls, you've gotta start lab and an end lab. Start lab and lab will turn on and
turn off AWS for your instance, you should only press
them once per assignment. And when you press start lab,
it's going to take it a minute, and what's actually happening now is, it's reaching
out to AWS, it's creating that IAM role. It's creating a user account for you,
it's setting up a bunch of configuration. And it then will give you back to
the normal prompt when it's done, as I said earlier,
everybody gets their own AWS account. Different labs have different time lengths
on it and so this is a two hour lab, which means you've got two hours
to complete the work for this. Once you're in here, you'll notice
that on this side of the page, the AWS link has gone green. If you click on this,
it will log you directly into AWS, you don't have to worry about
user names and passwords. You'll go through here, you'll do the
work, some of these have individual steps, some of them have code, you've got to
write, some of them have auto graders, some of them do not. When you're done, it's always
important to press the submit button, this will trigger the auto grader to run. Most of the auto graders for this class
have to connect to your AWS environment. And so, if your AWS environment is
stopped prior to you submitting it, you'll have to actually start over. So please,please remember
to press the submit button prior to leaving the lab,
you'll be asked if you want to submit and
it will go on from there. If you end up getting an error
that looks like this, you probably just need
to refresh your page, I don't think this will happen often
to you, but if it does let me know. Once you've pressed submit, you'll see
this submit and grading report and grading all running at the same time. This will take it a minute or
two, but when it's done, you will get a summary
of what your grades are. I don't think it's going to happen here
because we didn't do any work, and so the the auto graders are going to fail,
it did run. A little surprised that that happened, I guess I've got some better exception
handling in here than I thought I did. You've got a score of zero out of zero,
you haven't done any work so that makes sense. You will sometimes get feedback
in here as to what went wrong, if you click on the submission report, you're going to see in here that this has
got an error around creating a connection. This is trying to create a connection
to your RDS instance, so I left the exception handling in place and
you can just keep resubmitting. You can fix the problem resubmit,
fix the problem, resubmit as many times as
you need to to get it done. If you end up getting
close to the time limit, you can let us know and
we can give you more time. If you do press end lab, everything
you've done in AWS will be shut off. So if you've created instances,
if you've created firewall rules, anything you've done in AWS basically gets
destroyed when you press that end lab button, it will let you start over. The other thing to keep in mind is that
when you press end lab there's a little bit of time that it will take before
to let you start the lab again. It deletes all that
stuff in the background, it takes about 20 minutes to do it. So, just keep that in mind
when you end the lab, you've gotta wait about 20 minutes
before you start the next one. Thank you.
