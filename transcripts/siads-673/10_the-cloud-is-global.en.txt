One of the advantages
that a Cloud gives you is the ability to put
your data anywhere, well, almost anywhere
in the world. You want your data as close to your
customers as possible. If you have customers who
are in your backyard having a datacenter that's almost in your backyard
is advantageous. If you have customers
all over the world, you want to make
sure that your data is also all over the world, and accessible as close to
your customer as possible. This gets down to the
complicated concepts of routing traffic
over the Internet. This is a whole another deep conversation
that we could all go into, and I don't want to spend
a lot of time on this now, but basically, there's a lot of the Internet that's
designed to get your traffic to the
closest server that can answer it in the most
immediate way possible. In the Cloud, this gets resolved by something that are
known as regions. Every Cloud service
provider chooses regions of the world to put
their datacenters in, and so on the left-hand
side you can see what regions are
available for AWS, and on the right-hand side you can see the regions that are available for Google Cloud, and both lists scroll, this is not an exhaustive
list by any means, the point being is there are a large number of regions
available to you. Now, different servers and services cost different
things in different regions. You are effectively paying
what the differential from your Cloud provider in the region that they're
placing that equipment. In some regions, it is more expensive to run a
datacenter than others, and so when you're
placing servers, and services in
different regions, be aware that there are
some cost differences, and we'll talk in a
minute about how to do some cost calculations. When I say in a minute, I
mean another video of course. When you're deciding where
to put your services, you want to choose
the region that's closest to your customers. That may mean that
you need to put redundant services across
different regions, and replicate them, and every Cloud provider has different tooling
around replication. I don't want to get too
much into that here, but it exists, it's usable, you can go down that
documentation route. Except one of the things that happens with regions is, well, you want to be a little bit more redundant than just
the region itself, and so regions have what
are known as zones, and each region has one
or more zone within it. Actually, every region
has a least two zones, some have four, some have six. The idea being that when
you create a service, you want to put that service
in at least two zones. Zones are actually physically
separate datacenters, and so what's happening within a region when a
cloud provider says, hey, we want to go and put
a region in Ohio, they identify multiple zones, and those zones are at least
in separate buildings, sometimes they're in
separate sittings. The zones have very fast cable that connects them directly, they don't route over
the Internet, they can talk directly to each other, and the idea being if one
of those zones goes down, the services in the
other zones remain up. When you're placing
services into your Cloud, you have to choose your region, which effectively think of it as like the state or the city that
you're going to live, and then you're zone is
like your neighborhood, and they're separate
from each other. Now, one of the things to
keep in mind is that when cloud computing vendors make investments into new regions, and new zones, they don't
actually necessarily provide every service
to every region. There are also some services that are by definition global, if you are using their service, it is globally replicated. Amazon has a service
called CloudFront, which is a globally distributed
content delivery network for web traffic and video, but most people use it for web. When you use CloudFront, you actually don't get
to choose the zone. It is put in every
zone by default. Now, when traffic comes from
one zone or another zone, you may be billed
differently even though it's the same request
because it may cost more for your
customers who are in some areas of the world to access your content than others. Within the zone, there
are datacenters. An average datacenter for
a cloud provider has about 75,000 servers in it. If you think back to my
original analogy here, your corporate
datacenter has nowhere near 75,000 servers, and when I say that, I
don't mean virtual servers, I mean physical
rack-mount servers. Where the Cloud is able to excel as the economies of scale, there's no other reason for a corporation to have that amount of servers,
and keep in mind, each datacenter
is within a zone, there are multiple zones
within a region and most cloud providers have
at least 15-20 regions. That's a lot of servers. Ultimately, every single one
of these Cloud providers, all of them are built on top
of three basic functions. When you're looking
at Cloud providers, there's all different
ways to evaluate them, but ultimately they do
the same three things. Fundamentally, there is network. We think of network as the
cable we plug into the back of our computer or the Wi-Fi
that we may log into, but network within a datacenter
is way more confusing than that with lots of
complications around VLANs, and subnets, and firewalls,
and traffic routing, and most of that is exposed
to you as a customer. Now, when they're talking about network within a
Cloud environment, they're really referring
to something known as software defined network. In the olden days, so to speak, if you wanted to
switch a computer from one network to another, you'd go into a routing closet, and you'd pull a cable out, and you'd to push it in. Now we do that with
software. We have compute. Compute is the ability to do
processing of information, it is the CPU, it is the RAM. Every single service within a Cloud provider is dependent
in some manner on compute. Then there's disk or storage. Everything we do makes data, we have to store that data, each Cloud provider has their ups and downs
around storage, but ultimately, this
is what you've got. We're now going to start
getting into some of the more specifics around AWS. Our next series of videos
they're going to talk through, what does it actually take
to create a virtual machine, logging into a virtual
machine for the first time, and we'll go through
some of that, and we'll keep exploring. I look forward to
seeing you again soon.
