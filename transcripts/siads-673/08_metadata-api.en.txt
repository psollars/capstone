So imagine for a second you've
got a lot of EC2 instances. One of the accounts I have has
thousands of EC2 instances in it. And you log into them and
you're doing things on them but you really need to do some introspection. If you're looking at the console, it's really easy to know what's
happening with that EC2 instance. I know the name of the instance,
I know the instance ID, I can get other information about
it just by looking at the screen. But what if you're logged
into the EC2 instance and you want information about the EC2
instance that you're logged into? How do you go about doing that? How do you go about getting that
information out of that instance? And so if we log in here All I have that's easily identifiable
to me at the moment is the IP address. And so yes, I could say, okay, this is
172313.203, that's the private IP address. And come over here and I can find that and I could probably write code that does
all that, but that's a lot of work. It's also not necessarily letting
me see it from entirely within this infrastructure. You know what if I just want the instance
ID and I want to get it in the script so that I can log hey I was writing
this code on this instance. And so that if I need to go back and
look at the logs, I can figure out what happened to that. Amazon has this,
what they call the metadata API. And the metadata API is a fixed URL that will provide API information back. So curl is a command line library
that lets me pull the URL. I could do curl, Edu and
well okay it wants https.edu. And it will display anything
that comes out that URL. It's a really nice little utility for getting information off the internet
when you're on the shell. But I can call a curl command
to the metadata API which is this fixed IP address/latest/metadata. And it's telling me I've got
some other information here. And so one of the things that I'm able
to do in here is I'm able to say, you know what, give me the instance ID. Let's spell the word instance correctly. And so
what this is telling me is that I've got the instance ID directly from
within the console itself. And so here's the instance ID
it matches that instance ID. Yep, that is correct,
that's how this works. The metadata API is a really useful
tool to be aware of if you're doing like distributed computing,
logging what happens within your infrastructure is really really
helpful to know where things exist. Thank you.
