Hello. If you've taken
another class from me, then you've seen
these slides before. I am a huge fan of replicating certain
environments in the real world. I don't believe in typical
homework assignments, where I give you a problem set, and you just answer
the problems for the sake of the
homework assignment. You are all going to
be professionals, and part of being
a professional is understanding the business value behind
certain assignments. For this class, you are now
working at a fake company. Welcome to Borromean digital. You've got an email
here from Kelly that's welcoming you to
your new fake job. There's a wonderful
Borromean website. If you go take a look at it, it's actually really bad, but it's a fake company
designed to show a point here. We're waiting for you to
pass your background check. Most of you will have access to sensitive data and will have
to pass background checks. Here at Borromean, there's a group of
people who work here. You will get your homework
assignments posed as emails from the individuals
who work here looking for help
solving their problems. In this case, in the Cloud. Kelly is our CTO. She's got two degrees. She's not really the most
technical person in the world. She's your boss's boss's boss. Without question, she is
really a business person. She's got some cats and a dog. She likes to read the
physical newspaper in the morning, printed
on newsprint. She's in her early 50s, and she's married to Ian, who works in the
product team here. Sometimes, there's
some drama there, although I don't
think of this class. Raj is your supervisor. He's got a degree from Oxford. He really likes
playing with Alexa. He used to be on the web team. He's been here for a while. He also has a really fat cat. We've got our
director of security. He's been here for five years. Really he's unhappy
that somebody keeps taking candy out of his drawer. He doesn't really
like that very much. Then Lawrence is head
of our research group. Definitely, not a
technical person, likes to ask a lot of questions. He was an Analyst 11 years
ago and has slowly moved up to be the director of
research and development. One of the things
that happens in this class is there's
a lot of ambiguity. There are multiple ways to
complete the assignments and not necessarily
one of them is right. There are multiple correct
ways to get to the answer. There are some
questions that are worded in a manner that
it is to be ambiguous. In most classes, we have one
way to get to the answer. We have an Autograder
that comes in and says "This is how you
get to the answer. If you don't get to the answer, that way I fail you
on the Autograder." That's not how the
real world works. In the real world, your boss or the person who's asking you to do something
doesn't know the answer, and may not even know how to
go about getting the answer. So we try to recreate some
of that within this class, and that leads to
some ambiguity. In your homework assignments, if you don't know what to do, just describe what you did. If the answer is, "Hey, give me the data
from the database, and tell me about our sales
results for last year." Well, that database may have 25 years of data and in
across multiple regions. You may interpret
that request to say, "I'm answering this for the
European region because my boss happens to be the director of sales for
the European region." They probably don't
want worldwide sales. They want the European
region sales. When you answer the question, you might provide that
additional clarification. Likewise, you may get a
question that says, "Hey, we need you to spin
up a server to solve this Python
problem for this class." Well, there's not a lot of
detail around what type of server there is or the
requirements of that server. So you might actually have
to look at the problem, and respond back in
writing saying, "Hey, I spun up a small server. Answer this because
it looks like this is a pretty simple problem." Your ambiguity, it is where you bring your business
value back to your customers or your employer. Your ability to read
between the lines. In this class, we have a
decent chunk of ambiguity. If you get stuck or you're
feeling stressed out about it, please do reach out
to the teaching team, and we are happy
to help guide you down the path. Thank you.
