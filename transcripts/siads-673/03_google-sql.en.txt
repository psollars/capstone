We've talked about
how to spin up RDS instances in Amazon. In Google, it's a
similar mechanism. Google doesn't quite have
the support that RDS has. Google does MySQL,
Postgres and SQL Server. It does not have
an Oracle option, it doesn't have the added on other services
that Amazon has, but it works pretty
much the same way. What do we want to call this? What's our default password? You can see that it's using
the Postgres version. What version of Postgres? Do we want this highly
available or not mechanism? Then we can create our instance. It's pretty straight forward, and it's telling me that the
password which was Demo 1, 2, 3 has been found
in a data breach. That would make sense. It's pretty straightforward
on how this works. You'll see that by default and it actually dig
into the instance, so I'm getting a much
larger instance. But just like RDS, it lets me spin up and manage
that database instance. I'm not going to go
through creating a VM and connecting to
this over that VM. It'll work. One of the
nice thing that this does by default is the ability
to have query insights. This is really nice if you've got an application
also running on Google, because it'll do
that link between slow queries and
not slow queries. You've got a little bit more
like management within here. In the RDS instance, you actually can't
create a database or a user account through
the web interface, you have to log in and press the buttons to do that by hand. Google lets you do that
from their web interface. The backup functionality
is the same. This is going to
do seven backups, seven days a week
and rotate them out. That's exactly the same and the operations log is
also exactly the same. There's a lot of
similarity in here. There's only so many
ways you can run a managed database service. But for the most part, these do the same thing,
slightly different. The firewall rules here are
a little bit different, as I mentioned in the other
Google video, but overall, these are pretty much the
same concepts. Thank you.
