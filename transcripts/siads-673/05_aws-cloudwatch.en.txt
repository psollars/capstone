Hello. I'd like to talk a
little bit about CloudWatch. CloudWatch is Amazon's metric and reporting and
log management tool. There's a couple of things that almost everyone uses
CloudWatch for. Then there are some things that you can't use CloudWatch for. You can, for example, put logs from all of your
systems into log watch. If you've got databases or
you've used Amazon Studio, everything is going to
show up in here as log. If you've got a lambda
function, for example, you can come in here and see every one of that
lambda function. It's useful. You've got
to be a little careful. You are billed for the amount of data that go through these logs. You want to be careful
that you don't run them out of space. You also probably want to be careful about this
never expire thing, depending on if
you're dealing with a regulated data or not, probably a month for log retention is
probably about right. But what most people use
CloudWatch for are alarms. You can write alarms for pretty much anything that can happen within your
infrastructure. You can write alarms
for CPU usage, you can write alarms
for disk space usage. You can write alarms
for pretty much any metric Amazon can track, anywhere across its
infrastructure. You can do some
pretty sophisticated syntax around these alarms. We set up an API
gateway earlier, we can come down here and
basically start writing, what if our data starts
going higher or lower, whatever it may be based
on what we're doing. This is the number of requests or the number of bytes that have gone
through our data. You can see that
we've run 89 bytes. That was not a lot. You can do this as min or max. You can even come
down here and say, I want to do this based
on an anomaly detection. Did I get a lot more
or a lot less than I have in the past based
on how this is configured? I can say, give me an alarm if I go 2X what I do on average
at this time period. However, what most people should immediately set up an alert for, in whatever cloud instance
they're doing for this. This is AWS, but Google
and Azure both have the same thing, is
billing alerts. You can come into
here and you can basically specify where you want to basically
send an alert on. At the moment, I am currently estimating a charge of
about a penny a day. I'm probably not going to have any problem being
able to afford that, but I probably want to
be able to specify, if I go above 10 bucks on this account given
that I'm currently spending a penny a day, that's probably about right, I want to know what's happening, and I can specify, I can get in here, I can
say, "What do I want to do?" and typically use this
to send an email. You can configure
this to take actions. If you're running
primarily EC2 instances, you could shut your EC2
instances down based on this. Then when you want to send it, and so SNS is Amazon's mechanism but you could basically
come in here and say, "I want to send a message to mlhess@umich.edu and add
a notification here, and go through this, and figure it all out. I need to create a new topic. It works pretty well and you're able to go
through and set up these alerts and then you
don't get surprise bills. Probably the scariest thing that happens when you're using the Cloud is that
surprise invoice. I've got a story of a
student group I turned loose and they did something wrong and I got $128,000 invoice because they misconfigured something
in the Cloud, and I gave them a Cloud account with no restrictions on it. We had a conversation
with Amazon. Amazon was very gracious
and refunded all of it. But it's really
easy to spend money here and these
alarms allow us to have a mechanism in place
to know if you've exceeded a certain threshold and it gives you a little bit
of peace of mind. Depending on the dollar amount, what I'll typically do is
set up multiple alarms. I'll set up an email one and then I'll send up
one that'll text me. If I hit 10 bucks USD, great. Given that my average
is currently a penny, but if I hit 20, I want a text message. Something's really wrong. Setting up these alarms is a really useful tool
to keeping track of your AWS bill in real-time. Do keep in mind that you
do have to pay for these. They're not expensive at all and they save you tons of money. But keep in mind
everything with Amazon, you are paying for. Thank you.
