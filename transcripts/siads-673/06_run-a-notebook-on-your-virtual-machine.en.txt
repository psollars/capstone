I'd like to do now is actually install
a jupyter notebook on a cloud server. Now this isn't necessarily the most
straightforward process and so I'm going to go through it somewhat slowly,
you're going to have to do this for homework more than once, so
you should get used to doing this. And then as we move on in this course
you're going to learn other ways of accomplishing this type of work. But for
now we're going to do this by hand. So here's our machine
that's running we set up, we got this machine running earlier,
here's our public IP address and we're going to do an ssh and
paste in that IP address. It's going to come up the first time and
say, hey, are you are you sure this is the machine your, excuse me,
the machine you're authenticating to? Yes, and
we're going to get an error message. And the reason why we get an error
message is because this is mlhass and we need to connect to our machine
as either Ubuntu or Ec2 user, this is an Ubuntu machine so
it needs to be -l ubuntu. We can also write that as ssh ubuntu at,
either one works. They both do exactly the same thing. Now, here we are on our
brand new Cloud machine. Now, a couple of things to keep in mind,
when we go to install Jupyter, you're going to see here
that we can do JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook either will work. They both have similar things and
you're seeing, it's telling us to install it via pip,
pip is the python package managing system. If we just try this command
it's going to fail. And the reason is because
we don't have apt, we don't have the pip command installed
and we have to install that with apt. Apt is a package management system for
servers, specifically Ubuntu and Linux servers. And before we can use apt,
the directions don't tell you this. But you actually have to run
the command sudo apt-get update, and what this does is it says,
go to the internet and figure out all the packages
I can install on my system. And you're going to get that, and now we
can actually install the notebook and now we get this error message which is what
we got before but we can install that. And it's going to come up and
it's going to say, hey, you asked me to install python pip. But along with that, I'm going to install
a lot of other things, is that okay? And we're going to say,
yeah, that's okay with me. And it's going to go through and
it's going to install these things. It's going to take it
a minute to go through and actually get all these things installed. It downloads these from the internet. Just like pip would and
it installs them on the entire server. It'll take it a minute but
it will be done soon. Now there's another little
weird thing that happens when we're doing this on a on a VM. That isn't quite a little different
than what happens on your local machine. But when this is done, we'll go ahead and
reinstall the notebook and I'll show you what that looks like,
and it looks like it's done. We'll go ahead and run this and you're
going to see that this now actually does install what we'd expected to install. It looks like a normal
pip install process. And when we go to run it, there's a little bit of weirdness
that you have to keep track of here. Not a huge deal, but you see these
error messages, these are effectively saying that we're installing these
execute doubles in this path. And so if we just do what this says
jupyter notebook and press enter, it's going to give us another
error related to snap and that Jupyter is not installed or
actually specifically, it cannot be found. And it can't be found
because it's located here. This is a little bit of issues with
the way apt is installing packages, verse pip and we can run Jupyter by
doing home/ubuntu/.local/bin/jupyter. Now, we haven't talked a lot about how to
navigate the file system, but what this is effectively saying is, go to the root of
the file system, go in the home directory. Go into a bunches directory,
go into the local directory, go into the bin directory and
run the command called jupyter. Since if we run PWD, we are in home
ubuntu, we can actually just dot, sorry, local/bin/jupyter, and
we can then run it from here. There's one other command
we're going to run here and we're going to add in here and
it's really important ip 0.0.0.0. This has to do with some
networking things and some default security that jupyter
has built in that we need to say, don't just listen on the local server,
listen over the internet. We'll run that. It's going to take a second and we're
going to get a couple of things that come back to us,
now this gets a little bit confusing. First thing that we want to notice
here is that, we've got this token. We're going to need that in a minute. You'll also notice that it says
you can access this over this or over this, now 127.0.0.1. We're never going to use that. This is 172-31-25- 241. We actually go back to our amazon page. We see this here. This is the private IP address
versus the public IP address. And so when we see this we can pretty much
translate it to the public IP address, and so 8888. So let's go open a new web browser window. We're going to paste this in here. We're going to say 8888,
press Enter and here we are. It's asking us for
our password or our token, and you can see here that here is our token. So I'm just going to copy that
to my clipboard, highlight it, go to the edit command, choose copy,
come back over here, paste it in, log in. And this looks like a jupyter notebook
that I know, now this is on my server, it's not running on my local computer. You'll see here that the browser
that it's going through is this, that's my IP address of my server. If I create a new file here, so, I can do Demo rename and we can do, print(hello world), we can run, it appears to work
the way to expect it to. We can go ahead and exit out of this,
leave the page, that's all fine. We can see that it's here. If we go back to our server, you'll
see that this is still running here. If we want to exit out of this,
it tells us right here Use Control-C. And so are we sure we want to
shut down this notebook server? Yes, yes, I am. And if we run the ls command, you'll
notice that this demo is on this server, it is not locally available. This no longer runs because
the server is not there. If I restart my server here, it is but
this is existing on my server. So when I do something in here
that is computational heavy. It is going to use the servers
compute power, not my local computer, which means I can start a process in here,
leave and come back. As long as my server is running
that process continues to run. This is a little different than
your Coursera provided notebooks because those are short lived,
they will eventually go away. So you know, we can go back to print
Hello world, we can add a cell in here, we can do all the things that
we normally do within jupyter, it's all running as we expect to,
we can import our libraries. This is just running within
your server specifically. It's actually running as the user
ubuntu on your server and we'll get into a little bit
of what that means later on. But for now you've got a notebook up and
running and this will get you started
on your homework. The only other thing I'll add in here is,
I'm going to give you a notebook for your homework and if you wanted to
upload that notebook, you can come here. And this will allow you to
upload a file on your local computer into this notebook environment. It puts it on your server, there's other
ways to copy files to your server, but that's going to be one of the easier
ways to accomplish this, thank you.
