What I'd like to do now is I'd like to
use Amazon to create an instance and log into it. And so I want to create a virtual machine
and I want to remotely log into it, before I can do this I have to
have generated my key pair. And so I'm going to go under services and
I'm going to make this full screen just so it's easier to see what's going on and
we'll close this Azure pricing calculator. And so we're going to go under services,
and we're going to open up EC2 and I want to make sure I know where I am. I'm currently in Ohio,
I'm okay staying in Ohio, and the first thing I need to do is I
need to tell Amazon about my keys. So if we look on here, we have a key
pair and there's two options here. One, you can have this create a key pair
for you or you can import an existing key pair depending on where you are in those
tutorials either is perfectly fine. I'm going to import a key pair
that I've already made and this is stored on my computer
in the tilda.ssh directory. And I want to be careful that
I'm only pulling the public key, not the private key so it ends in .pub. It's good to pull and
we can see that it put it down in here and I'm just going to call this recording. And so you'll notice that it's in here,
fingerprint uniquely identifies it, it gets an internal key ID,
everything else is pretty straightforward. So the next thing I want to do here,
is I want to actually create my instance. I'm going to go under instances and
I'm going to say, hey let's launch a new instance. And I'm going to get a lot of different
instance types that I can launch. Amazon has their own version
of Lennox that they provide, which they are promoted as the first one. You can actually launch an entire Mac
computer in here, that's great for software testing. Red hat is an enterprise version of
Lennox that costs a little extra, I'm going to go with Ubuntu. Ubuntu is kind of a community
version of Lennox, it's supported, it works really nicely and
I'll go ahead and choose select. And now it's going to ask me what
size instance do I want, and so these are measured by types T2 Nano,
T2 micro small medium and large. And as we've discussed earlier they
compare to the CPUs and the memory. I'm going to stick for now with a T2
micro instance that's going to give me one CPU and one gig of RAM. And I could just skip ahead and
launch it, but I'm going to actually go through
the details in real time here. And so what are the options I have? Well a couple of things that
you're going to see happen here. First of all I've got
to choose the network, we only have one network in this but you
might have different networks depending on your configuration within your cloud. And it's going to ask me what subnets and
that's going to be the, what availability zone is,
what that's translating into. Should I get a public IP address there's
a bunch of other options in here. I'm going to go ahead and just take
the defaults, it's going to ask me for my storage, please don't make this more
than eight gigabytes, that's a cost, that creates a cost for us. So we're going to keep that
at eight gigabytes tags, tags are every cloud supports tags, tags are a way to keep track
of what this item does. You can use them for access control,
you can use them for billing. We don't need them in our instance here,
security group, this one is actually important. By default, what's going to happen is
this is going to open up a create a new security group, it's going to call it
launch Wizard one which doesn't really make a lot of sense here. And it's going to open up
ssh to the entire world, anyone in the world can ssh into this. Now I don't really want to do that,
I probably want to change the source to my IP which is going to be the current
IP address that I'm using. If I leave it as anywhere it's going to
be anywhere in the world but for now what I want to do is I'm probably
going to change this to be all traffic. And rather than just ssh I'm going to
say all traffic from anywhere. Now what I've done is actually quite
insecure but for the purposes of learning what we're doing this is an easy
way to go about doing this. And so what this is effectively is
any piece of traffic anywhere in the world can hit the server. If you want to set this to be your IP,
it's a much more secure environment depending on how your
personal Internet is set up. This may cause some headaches for
you either is fine, what I do recommend you do is that if you're going to say
all traffic, set this to be anywhere. You can specify my IP but
then say all traffic from and then just put this IP address in here,
it makes life easier. One of the things to keep in mind is that
if you're setting up a traffic role that's all traffic from a specific IP address. Your IP address on the Internet can change
depending on how your Internet set up, it's not likely to change within two or
three hours. But if you reboot your modem or
over the course of a few days it may change I'm going to
set this back to all traffic. And carry on. Now this is my final page I got
to review the settings I've done, it's going to come up and warn me that
I've done this all traffic thing again. That's okay and
I'm going to go ahead and press launch. Now here's where this gets important, I have to specify what key should
be allowed to access this machine. And I'm choosing my recording key which I
originally created, and I'm going to press I acknowledge that I have access
to this and press launch instance. It's going to go ahead and
get that set up and running and when it's done you should see
a page that looks like this and you can actually click on the instance and
you'll see some information about it. You're going to see your instance ID,
you're going to see a state, you're going to see a type and you're going to
see some other basic information on this. I almost always give my instances
a name recording demo that helps me figure out what they are later on. You'll notice that when this first loaded
this said pending, it now says running. Even though it says running,
it can sometimes take a minute or two before it's really ready for
use which is why you see me talking. You'll see the status check here at
some point that won't be initializing, it will actually, it'll give a green light
at which point it's really ready for for someone to log in. But if we're a little impatient, what we can do is we can see here
that there is a public IP address and a private IP address, we almost
never need the private IP addresses. So let's ignore that for now,
let's go look at the public IP address. We're going to copy that public
IP address to our clipboard and we're going to open up our terminal which
we use to remotely access our servers. If you're on a Mac, you're just going to
run your terminal, if you're on a PC you're going to want to download a piece
of software called not that called PuTTY. PuTTY is a free tool to download,
to access servers over ssh and you've probably already downloaded
this to set up your key. And so what I'm going to come over here
and do is I'm going to type in ssh and I'm then going to make
sure I pasted my IP. Now when you set up a server for
the first time, a virtual machine, most cloud providers don't know who you
are, what user name you like to use. So they create a default account. We set up an Ubuntu machine. So by default we want to log in as Ubuntu,
if you set up an Amazon AWN, Amazon Lennox machine or a red hat
machine, you would log in as EC2 user and there's a read me file that
walks you through that. But we're going to use the Ubuntu account,
and it's going to first come up and
say, hey is this the right host. And you're going to say yes here, and
it's going to take it a second, but then you're going to notice that you
are remotely logged in on this computer, You have logged into another server. Now, if you try to click in here, you
can't do anything with your mouth, you're on this server over ssh, you're only
interface is with your command prompt. So LS PWD these are the commands
you're going to use in here. Let me know if you have
any questions in Slack, otherwise we're going to move
on to installing jupiter.
