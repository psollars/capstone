We're going to start creating our own
resources in your personal student account. Now, a couple of notes on this, we,
the University of Michigan are paying for your accounts so please follow
the directions were giving you in class. Be careful not to spend or use any more resources than what you're
supposed to for the given assignment. If you're caught abusing this, it will be
referred through the normal disciplinary actions for students which
can include up to expulsion. UoM has a pretty good rule set on running
Bitcoin miners on cloud resources, it is grounds for expulsion so
please don't do that. For the most part, as long as you follow
the homework assignments in order, you should be pretty good
from a cost perspective, but please don't actually abuse
University of Michigan resources. It makes a lot of work for me and
a lot of work for the administration and it's no fun for anybody. But with that we will be provisioning
you through canvas which is our learning management system we're using for
this course, your own personal cloud account and
have fun enjoy, explore.
