So this is a course on machine learning. We spent a lot of time going over
the basics of how things work. And when we think about machine learning,
a lot of things come to mind. But most of the time we come back to,
okay, well we have a machine learning problem. And we're going to build a model and
we're going to test our model and we're going to see if it works, then we're
going to prduce some business results and then we're going to move on. Maybe we'll fix our model if
it's not performing well, but we have this process around doing this. And yes, that is machine learning,
there's no question. But oftentimes if I say, here's a problem. In fact, you know, if I do this in a mads
classify, say, hey, here's a problem. How would you solve this? At some point, the students
are going to come back to, well, I'm going to build a model or I'm going to
train a model or I'm going to test this. And oftentimes that's
not the best approach. So I'll give you an example
that comes to mind. You need to find labels for images. You are trying to find
instances of a backpack or you're trying to do facial detection. And so your thought might be okay, well,
give me 1000 images of people's faces or 10,000 peoples images of people's faces,
label them. And we'll build a model to do that, and yes, you can do that, but
why when you have the cloud. When we go into Amazon's
machine learning tab, there's a lot of different
services within here. And we're going to go through
a lot of these together. Some of these are fun services. Some of these are just really cool. For example, deep racer,
deep racer is the coolest thing, the coolest service from
Amazon that I've seen. You get to race a car with machine
learning and you actually, where is it? You actually buy this car? This is a thing they sell on Amazon,
like the actual Amazon.com. You buy this car, it's a little kit,
you put together, it interfaces with Amazon's cloud. And you can build a model around
racing on this and it's Amazon. So they're saying,
hey you're charged for the storage, that's going to be S3 training and
evaluation. That's going to be compute. And this is $3.50 an hour and
model storage is 23 cents, I'm sorry,
two cents per gigabyte per month. And you can actually go and buy this and
compete in Amazon services. There's not really like a business
value specifically to this tool set. That's not entirely true. There are things you can do here, but
this is really a training aspect. When I spent a lot of time learning about
machine learning aspects in the cloud, there are two Amazon
services that I use a lot. And we're going to spend time on them this
week, Amazon Forecast is one of them. Amazon Forecast is the concept of
the basic forecasting of services. This is a common machine learning
task given the history of events, predict the future. And so where you'll see this
is in retail sales a lot. Hey, this is what we've sold
over the past two years, what do you think we're going to do next? You'll also see this in workforce
automation type things. So we know cognitively that at the start
of the mads, course there's a lot of more work for the infrastructure and support
staff folks that have to do things. So if you look at like how much work
they're doing, handling drop requests, putting people in slack channels. All of that type of work is significantly
higher at the beginning of the course and at the end of the course and
that's just common sense. But can we take all of the inputs and
build a model around that and the Amazon Forecasts attempts to do that. Once again this is the concept
around pricing on this. So what are you charged for? You're charged for your data,
you're charged for training and then you're charged for
making forecasts themselves. And so you can see how
the pricing works around here. 1000 forecast data points is two bucks,
for your 100K. And then if you need explanations around
that then it's another two bucks. So you're spending $4
plus the amount of RAM, plus the amount of time to train a model. Now, I don't think we're going to actually
have you go through this as part of a homework assignment. I might give you a demo if
you're interested in it, but it's not going to be
a required assignment. I'll give you the AWS demo is
what I'll probably do for this. But the idea here is that this is
a system that you don't have to write any real code to use,
the hard part is done for you. Now, yes you've got to get your data
in the format that it wants it and you have to call the amazon APIs. But you don't actually have
to write the model yourself. It builds the model for you. The other machine learning service
that we're definitely going to use is image recognition. And so what this does is
exactly what it sounds like, you give it an image and
it tells you information about the image. And we'll get to that in an upcoming
homework assignment soon. But I think my point of this video is to
think through the aspect of just because you can build something doesn't mean
the cloud hasn't already done it. And in most cases, if the cloud provider has done it,
they've probably done a better job. They have more resources to throw at
the problem, more time and more energy. Now, if you've got some specialized
thing that you need to do, great, that's a different story. But if you're just trying to get labels
out of an image, this is pretty solid and it's a pretty easy tool to use,
as you'll see this week in your homework.
