The following content
is from AWS Academy. AWS academy is AWS'
is training program. You can go through AWS
Academy resources for free. It's very much geared
towards certification tests. It also very much is
on the AWS Kool-Aid. It's built and written by AWS, so there's no criticism of AWS at all from it and
that's not entirely fair. I don't really like using their content much but
for this instance, they do a really
good job covering their identity and
access management. If you are interested in other AWS Academy
content or taking AWS certifications,
reach out to me. I'm happy to connect you
with those resources.
