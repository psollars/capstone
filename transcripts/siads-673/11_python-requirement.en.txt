This class uses Python as its primary
programming language. I am not teaching you how to write Python code in this class. At this point in
your MADS journey, you should be familiar
with Python enough to write the code
required for this class. I expect you to have an understanding of
how Pandas works, I expect you to be able to
read API documentation, I expect you to be able to do some basic debugging
and troubleshooting. If you get stuck, I'm always
available to help you, but for the most part, I'm going to basically
give directions on write the python to do X, Y, and Z and expect
that you're going to be able to go off and
write that python. But as I said, if you get
stuck, please let me know, I am happy to help, so is any member of the
teaching team. Thank you.
