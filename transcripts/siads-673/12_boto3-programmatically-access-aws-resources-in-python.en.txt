I want to talk about how you programmatically
access resources in the Cloud. So far in this class, we've been clicking
buttons in a console and we've been spinning up instances and creating things by using point-and-click,
by using a mouse. Boto3 is the library that is used to access AWS for Python, and anything you can
do in the console, you can do through the library. You'll see where this comes up in some of your
homework assignments. I'm not going to actually
walk you through how to use this in too much detail. I am going to show
off one thing, but you're going to
be expected to read the API documentation to learn how to actually access these resources
programmatically in the Cloud. One of the things I want
to talk about here is how you authenticate
AWS from your code. There's really a couple of
different ways to do this. One of them is the
environmental variables, AWS access key ID, and AWS access key
and the other way is to specify it within
the Boto3 constructor, which is what you'll
see for this homework. Depending on where
you're working and how you're doing it, your organization may have
specific rules around it. But Boto3 is an
extremely powerful tool. The API documentation
for this is extensive. Their every service
that's in Amazon. Every single service
that's available to AWS has a Boto3 endpoint to it. We've talked about
EC2 instances. We're going to actually come
here and see everything related to how to interact
with EC2 instances. From here, you'll notice that when you created
an EC2 instance, you had to specify a key pair, you had to create
your instance itself, and all of this is doable
from with the API. Now what do we use
the API here for? Well, we're going
to be automating some S3 interactions so that we can save to file
systems in the Cloud. The auto-graders are
exclusively using the APIs but you don't have to worry about how they're
working internally. They inherit their credentials
from your environment. But it's important to
know that this is here. You will likely have a homework
assignment where you are asked to figure out
how to use this API, how to invoke it
within your code base. Let me know if there's
any questions.
