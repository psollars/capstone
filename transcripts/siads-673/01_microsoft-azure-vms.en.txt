We're going to take a quick
look at Azure here. I actually find Azure to be
the most confusing toolset here, that's my personal opinion. Part of the reason behind
that is Azure is very much built into the Microsoft ecosystem and
everything. If you're all a Microsoft shop
it works really, really well. But I'm just not a fan of how tightly
integrated this is with their other products. Once again, that's my personal opinion. As Azure also has a built in incentive to
sell other Microsoft products through it. So, when you're using this, you are also integrated with their
active directory tooling and whatnot. But if we wanted to go through and
recreate spinning up a server here, we can create a virtual machine. This is all centered around
the concept of resource groups. So, in AWS and in Google you
create lots of different accounts. In here, you've got subscriptions and
then under subscriptions, you have resource groups. So, it's a slightly different model and
it's not necessarily a worse model. It's just Google and Amazon have
the same like concept model and Azure has a different one. So, it takes some comparison there. But just like in the other instances,
we give this a name, we have to choose the region
we want to put it in. So, we'll put this in US East. Do we want to have some built
in availability configuration? This is actually nice here
that it does it here, and it doesn't make you spin
this up separately. What image do we want to use,
here's the spot instance configuration. Here's the pricing options and so it's a little harder to like
navigate this in my opinion. Maybe that's just personal
because I spend so much time between Google and
I spend so much time with Amazon that navigating through
this just seems a little bit harder. But you can feel free to come to office
hours and argue with me on that. I will say I do like the fact that
it tells me the pricing up front. I also came here and I said,
I want to be able to click here, there's just some basic usability
issues within here I think. I can come in here and I can say,
by default, what ports do I want? This is similar to the firewall
rules in both the other systems. So, I can say what I want a web server and
SSH by default. And as I go through here I can
choose the disks I want and how I want those disks to work. I can configure my networking in here,
Management things that come through here, this is
the integration with Azure AD directly. Auto shutdown is a really nice
feature that is somewhat unique here. I can basically say, hey,
this shouldn't be running past 7PM and for whatever reason it is
shut the instance down. I can turn on backups within here. That's also a nice feature. We can go through here and
finish off actually. I went a little too fast on that page. Just like Google just like Amazon,
Azure also has a concept of tags. And we'll say go ahead and create. And it created that key pair for me because I didn't have one uploaded to
Azure already and let me download it. And it's now going to go through and
submit this concept of a deployment. And as it does the deployment,
it spins up different resources. Different systems in Azure have different
like deployment container systems. While it's doing that, I guess I'll
talk a little bit about sequel. You can spin up managed sequel databases
just like in the other platforms. And so, you can come through here and
spin up how you want this to work, how you are configuring it. It's a little bit more involved because
you effectively have to create a sequel instance. And then you have to
create the server itself. And you'll notice I just got
a notification saying that my deployment is done. So, I can come back over here and
I can say go to resource. And this is now my resource
page on this instance. So, just like everything else
I gotta public IP address, you can see that there's the basics
restart, stop, and terminate within here. So, I don't need this anymore. I'm going to go ahead and delete it and say yes, delete all of
these things with the virtual machine. In some ways, this is nice because it lays
out exactly what it's going to do and in some ways it's not. But if you're a heavy Azure user or
your company uses Azure, I'd love to hear more about you. I'm going to probably spend the least
amount of time covering Azure in this class because I simply just
don't like it as much. But if you really want more Azure content, I am happy to make some Azure content for
you. I do have three somewhat
large projects in Azure. The API for it's actually pretty nice
except it's all built around Power Shell, which is Microsoft's shell environment or
scripting environment. Yeah, thank you all.
