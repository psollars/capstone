Hi, welcome to Cloud Computing. This course is going to be a little different
than what you're used to, but I'll get into
that in a minute. I'm really excited you're here. This course has been really
fun to design and build. When we build some courses
in the MADS Curriculum, my machine-learning pipelines
course, for example. A lot of it is, "Okay,
here's the content, here's the homework
assignments and we're done." This course was actually built with the Cloud for the Cloud. So it's a little bit
of a matrix here and that we are
building the course in the Cloud to teach the Cloud. So we have a lot of fun with
some of the setups here. If you come to office hours, I'm happy to show
you how some of the backend systems work. I should formally welcome
you to the Cloud. Yes a little cheesy,
I apologize. This course is going to be fun. We're going to explore
Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Azure, Azure is a Microsoft product. So we're going to be primarily
focusing on AWS here. Amazon is probably
the most well-know cloud vendor or really started what we know
as cloud computing, and it was their first, so it's got a higher
rate of adoption. But we will also spend time
talking about how to do things in the other
Cloud providers. Cloud computing is
a really cool way of thinking about how our work, how we do our work. It's a different paradigm. It's a different way to
go about problem-solving. And so throughout this course, we'll discuss how that works. For those of you who
don't know who I am. My name is Michael Hess. I have been around the
university for 28 years. I am responsible for large parts of infrastructure
that run in the Cloud. I do a large amount of data
processing through the Cloud. Currently, I've got a
large project that I just finished a
couple of weeks ago, where we're getting data
from around the state of Michigan and we are calculating
every data file we get, we calculate some
metrics off of that. The data that comes in
is about a terabyte a piece and we calculate
five values off of it. We do this without any servers. You guessed it,
entirely in the Cloud. This course is a
little bit different. There are aspects of this
course that go through our residential learning
management system called Canvas. We use Coursera for most
of our math's courses. You'll see there are links from the Coursera instance
into Canvas. Most of the grading
occurs in Canvas. Coursera doesn't really
work well with some of the Cloud stuff that we've built specifically for this class. This course is also a little bit different in that the Cloud has this ethos
around being agile, and so my goal for
this is to take student feedback each week
during this course and record a video or a demo and republish it every
week to all of you. We do this a little
bit in office hours, but I'm thinking more
of a formal demo that we would record and
rerecord anything that changes. The Cloud is
constantly changing, it's constantly moving forward, and as a result, some of these videos
will likely have to be edited and rerecorded in real time during this course
or right before the course. I do encourage everyone
to come to office hours. I know everybody says that
here in every course, but here with the Cloud, there's so much
we could go over. If you come to office
hours and you've got specific questions
that you want to demo on a cool technology, please come, we'll do all sorts of fun things
in office hours. There is a weekly survey that I'd also like
everybody to take. You'll see that
inside of the course. I really hope you
enjoy this class. It's going to be fun. It's going to be a
little different, but let's enjoy the Cloud.
