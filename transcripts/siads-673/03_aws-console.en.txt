Hello. In this video, I'd like to do some basic
exploration of the AWS console. From what you can see on my screen here as I
have just logged into AWS and I've got what appears
to be pretty much nothing. There's nothing showing up here because this is a brand new, fresh account with nothing
on it at the moment. Where I mostly started here
is the Services menu or if I know the exact service I'm looking for, I
can search for it. On services menu, you can
start to get a feel for all the different things that AWS has built in on top of it. Now, we mentioned earlier
on there's really three core services for
every cloud vendor. If we scroll down we will
see that computer is really where we originally
spend most of our time. EC2 is the concept of virtual
servers in the Cloud. What you can see here is I've
got pretty much nothing. This is a very default
install of AWS. There's nothing configured
in here at all. Normally when you're thinking about a
corporate environment, you don't get access to this
level of an AWS console. You would have some
type of lock down environment where you can't
do everything in here. For your homework assignments, we steer you in the right
direction to help save costs, and I'll get into costs
in another video. One of the things
to keep in mind here is when you're looking at this console there's a
couple of things to note. First of all, your
center panel is where all your information is, but up at the top there's a couple of
things that are useful. One, it's going to show you
who you are logged it as, for you you're going to have
a much longer username. It's going to show
you the region that you're currently working in. I'm currently in
US East Virginia, and if I went to Ohio, it's almost like a completely
different service. I'll give an example
of that in a second. Then over here you've
got your menus of what you're able to do. Later on, we'll start
spinning up instances and start using the
Cloud to do things. Down here you've got the list of zones that are available. In US-East-1 where
currently I'm located, there are in number of zones, but if I were to
switch to US-East-2, US-East-2 only has three zones. It's a much smaller
region for AWS. If we take a look
at our networking, and so I'm just going
to search for network. We're going to see here
that there's a VPC. VPC is Amazon's mechanism for
managing network resources. The reason I'm taking you in here is I want to show that by default you get a VPC that's
spun up in every region. Here's my VPC and you'll
notice that this is a VPC that has an internal
ID number ending in 617. If I go back to Virginia, I have a VPC that's a
different ID number. The resources from one region to another region are separate. They are completely
dedicated from each other. Now I can make
connections between them, but by default each
region stands on its own. If I go back to Ohio, and I go back into
EC2 for a second, I can see that I've got no
instances running here. If I had instances running
within this region, if I were in US-East-1 or Virginia I wouldn't
see them running. This is kind of an example of how to get familiar
with the interface. I suggest you spend some time exploring
the EC2 interface. Don't actually
launch any Services. If you really want
your own satellite, you can actually spin up a
ground station instance. You won't be able to
in these accounts, because it requires provisioning but it is a thing
that you can do. You can also look into internet of things
device management. I was talking about this
in one of my other videos. What you're able to
do here is really amazingly cool management
of end devices. I'm not going to go through and click all of these
but as you can see pretty much
everything isn't here. For the next few
homework assignments, we're going to be looking at
the database end of things, and we're going to be looking at the Compute end of things. That's really where we're
going to spend our time. After that, we'll dig into
some of the machine-learning tooling around AWS
itself. Thank you.
