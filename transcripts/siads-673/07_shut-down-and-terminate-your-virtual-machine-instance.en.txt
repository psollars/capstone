So as we've discussed when you're
running Cloud compute resources, you are paying by the minute, by the hour or whatever arrangement
you have with your Cloud provider. In this instance, we are paying by the
minute for these resources and that makes sense, if we're using the resources,
we want to pay for what we're using. And so when we come in here and
we say, you know what, we need a new instance in here and we're going to
spin up a new Ubuntu server here and. So far we've been staying in
the smaller instances, but as we get up to some of
the larger instance types, let's come down here and
we'll take a look for an m5 extra large. So this is going to give us to 2 CPUs,
8 gigs of RAM and we'll go ahead and launch this one up, or we use our existing
security group in here. And as these instances are running,
we pay by the minute for each one of these instances that run. Now, how do Cloud vendors
make their money? Well, have you ever signed up for a
subscription, forgotten you've had it and six months later you're looking at
your credit card bill and you're like, yeah, I forgot to cancel that. Or this sometimes happens with gym
memberships where they make it so difficult to cancel that it's sometimes
easier just to pay the 10 dollars a month than to have to send certified
mail to actually cancel the instance or cancel your membership. In the cloud,
this is a lot easier to handle and so, I've got my three instances here,
I'm going to just give them some names. Spell test correctly. And so as these machines are running,
I might have processes running on them, I might have complex things on them,
but at some point my workload is done. And shutting these instances off, you can
do it from the command line, you can type in the word power off or pseudo power
off depending on your instance. And it'll shut the instance down and
that's that or you can do it through this console,
and when we stop an instance, there's really two separate ways
to go about stopping an instance. One of them is,
we can shut the instance off. So that's the equivalent of walking
up to your laptop and turning it off. The other is we can
terminate the instance. Now when we shut an instance off,
we can turn it back on. So just like your local computer, when you
turn your computer off and you want to come back the next morning, you can press
a button and you can turn it back on. With the Cloud, we can actually
terminate the instance as well, which is the equivalent of throwing
your computer in the trash can. And so if we select an instance here,
we can go up to the incident state and we have stop, reboot and terminate. Now, if we stop an instance. So I just stopped the test instance? If I refresh this a couple of times
we'll see that it's in a state of stopping eventually,
it will go to a state of stopped and this stops our billing for
the instance itself. But if there are hard drives attached
to this, we'd still be on the hook for paying the storage fees. So this instance here
has a hard drive on it. I can see that this is 8GB and I can, whatever the cost of 8GB is,
I am responsible for paying that. And you can find out the cost rate
gigabytes in the cost calculator which is in another video. So, in the event I might need to
turn this back on at a later date, I can stop it which is what I've done,
it will eventually show stop it now does. And I can go back to incidents state and
I can say start, and that will turn the instance back on. When I go to turn it back on it's likely
going to get a different IP address than what it had before. But that's okay. And once it turns back on
I can log back into it and do whatever I want to do with it. Sometimes though I've done
my work on my instances and I can get rid of them entirely. So terminate instances
going to come up and say, hey, we're going to delete the data attached to
this, are you sure you want to do this? And I'm going to get rid of these green
things, giving me confirmation here and you'll notice that now those instances
are in a state of shutting down and they will soon go to
a state of terminated. Meanwhile this test instances now back up
and running and you know what I don't need it either so I will terminate this one as
well and it will completely shut off, and we'll give that a minute and
they will all go to terminate it. It's really useful and good business sense to think through
the instances you need to be running 24/7. The instances you don't want to run 24/7
and make sure that you've got a policy in place that prevents you from
accidentally running instances too long. Unlike your gym membership,
it's really easy to terminate an instance. Thank you all.
