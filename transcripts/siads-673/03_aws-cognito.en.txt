Along with Compute and
networking and disk, the cloud also tries to solve some use cases that people keep trying to have
to develop around. Imagine you're building
an application and one of the common
problems that you need to solve is the ability
to have people log in and authenticate to
use your resources. Amazon Cognito is one of the services that
can handle this. It's an Automated Identity
Management Solution that exists in Amazon. Google has something called
Identity Aware Proxy, which is a little different but the same
place you can use Identity Aware Proxy along with Google Firebase and
achieve the same results. In the next assignment, when you're building
your dashboard, you're going to use Cognito
to handle authentication, except you're going
to be authenticating an anonymous user. You don't actually
have to login. You could modify the
assignment to require a login through Google or
another cloud toolset. But don't worry about doing
that for this assignment, but Cognito is a
really cool tool. It solves this use case. It's worth learning
more about if you're building
interactive applications.
