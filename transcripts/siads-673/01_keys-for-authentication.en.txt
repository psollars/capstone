I want to talk a little
bit about keys today. When we say the
word key we often think of the idea
of opening a door, we put a key in and we turn it, or sometimes we have
keys that we're given temporarily because
we're allowed access to a special
office to use. But ultimately, a key is a
thing that holds a pattern. When you take that key and
you put it inside of a door, the door recognizes that pattern via a mechanical mechanism, and you turn it and it
allows the door to unlock. Now, keys have been
around for a long time. They effectively all
do the same thing, the pattern is
recognized, you turn, it allows the door to turn, and the door opens. To get into Michigan buildings and many corporate offices, you use your Mcard. Your Mcard acts as a key. It even has a little
key logo on it. These have an RFID reader or an RFID chip in them that when put near an RFID reader says, "This is my identification
information", then a centralized system says, "Oh this Mcard is at the door, should we allow
the door to open?" The answer is either
yes and which you hear a nice lock or no,
and you don't. If you wanted to get in North
Quad where SI is housed, you would present your Mcard
and the door would either open or not based on
your authorization. Now, the fun thing here is
what if you lose your key? There's a website called
dangerous things. Obviously, it's got
dangerous things, so take this with
a grain of salt, that actually allows you to implant a key inside
of your hand. It's a little RFID chip
that you can then actually use to unlock doors in
corporate buildings, you can replace your
gym card with it, any place that reads an RFID
chip, you could use this. I do have a friend who
has actually done this. That's not their X-ray, that X-ray is from
dangerous things. But she indicated it
wasn't that big of a deal. You just basically put this
little thing in there, it gives you a little scar and it's very convenient
because you never have to lose your key because
it's inside of you. This gets to security though, because keys are a fundamental
practice in security. When you access a server,
how do you do this? Most of the time the
answer is, use a password. Sometimes you have
two-factor authentication. University has two-factor
authentication through a company called Duo. The idea behind two-factor
authentication is it's something that you know, like a password, and then something you have, like a code which
is on your phone. Three-factor authentication
is just a third factor, something you know, a password, something you have like a phone, and something you are like a fingerprint, retina scan, etc. This is significantly
more secure because if somebody ends
up with your password, they can't actually gain
access to a system. But passwords are inherently one of the weakest forms
of security in existence. This is a sign that used to hang in almost every
University of Michigan. Actually, this wasn't
the Michigan one, but there's a Michigan version like this where it basically says is trying to get you to set a strong password
and no one does it. Actually no, this was
the Michigan one, I take that back. In the late 90s when people were slowly beginning to use
computers more and more, the threat of bad actors
figuring out passwords because most passwords at
the time were password or 1, 2, 3, 4, was high. There were education
campaigns out to get you to set strong passwords, they didn't work then,
they don't work now. One of the things
that happened is we moved to using what are
called security keys. Both websites use this and SSH, which is the protocol we'll use to access servers in this class, can use a security key. It's actually two separate keys and they're called
together a key pair. You have your public key, and your public key is
given to other people, you give it out freely, it's literally called
the public key. Then you have your private key, and your private key is
something you don't share. Now, unlike a password, these are random, you're not going to
memorize either your public or your private key. This is an example
of a public key. You'll see on top it tells
me the type of key this is. There's the key in there
and then there's a note at the bottom which
is often who and where that key was created, but it can be anything you
want it to be at the bottom. Your private key
starts with the line, begin private key, and then there's a bunch of
random letters and numbers, and you have at the
end, end private key. Together, these will
identify you to a system. If you want to be able
to log into a server, you give that server your public key and when
it sees the corresponding private key they fit
together like a key in a lock and it will allow
you into that server. Websites will also use
keys for authentication. I'm not going to get too
much into that here. I don't think it's the same type of public and private key, we're not going to get
into that very much here, but you do notice that when you have a secure icon
in your web browser. For the purpose of this class, you will need to
generate a public and a private key for
your work here. Now, I will give you some resources on how to do that depending on if you're
on a Mac or PC, it'll be in different
places and so I'll give you the resources on how to generate those public
and private keys. It's a little bit hard
the first time you do it, but you get the hang of it
pretty quickly. Thank you.
