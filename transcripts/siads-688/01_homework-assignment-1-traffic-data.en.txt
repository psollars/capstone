Hi everyone. I'd like to discuss the first
homework assignment and the data set is
drawn from the study on social comparisons status
and driving behavior. The three topics
I'd like to cover are why we want to do a logarithmic
transformation of the outcome variables. The second topic is about
Poisson regressions and the third one is about
clustering standard errors. Let me first talk about the
logarithmic transformation. Lots of times when we encounter empirical data,
they're highly skewed. If you look at the
bottom left graph, you will see that the horizontal axis is the
number of traffic tickets drivers received in the
month post-intervention. So mm is the number
of traffic tickets a driver receives in the
month post-intervention. On the vertical axis
is the density. You see a huge spike
at zero because, for most drivers, they haven't received any, for any given month, they probably don't
receive a traffic ticket. But then you have if
you look carefully, these tiny little bars
that go all the way to 30. In rare cases someone
received a ticket every day. In these very skewed
distributions, one way to make it less skewed is to take a logarithmic
transformation. Once you do that in the data set, you will actually find a variable called log underscore mm, which is the natural
log of mm plus one. The reason we use mm plus one is because the log of
zero is not defined. For those who have zero tickets, the log of transformation
is going to be log of one, which is zero. If you look at the
right-hand side, the distribution is still skewed, but much less so than
the left-hand side. This is why we will ask
you to actually use log mm as the dependent variable
when you do your analysis. That's the first point.
The second point is - I'm not sure how many of
you have encountered this - but sometimes the data has
such a feature that it doesn't make sense to use ordinary least
squares regressions. We would use Poisson regression. I'm going to chat
a little bit about when we use Poisson regressions. Usually the dependent
variables are counts or rates. In our case, the dependent
variable will be counts. How many tickets you received in the month post-intervention. The dependent variable y, number of tickets, has a
Poisson distribution. What is a Poisson distribution? In the formula I gave you
the precise definition. This is the probability
of a given number of events occurring in a fixed
interval of time or space, if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time
since the last event. In other words, at any
given time in the month, pass after the intervention, the next ticket someone
receives is independent of the last time someone
violates the traffic rule. The lambda, the
parameter lambda in the Poisson distribution, is
defined as the arrival rate. It is y, the outcome
variable divided by t, which is the time interval. On the right-hand side, you see a distribution of
various types of lambdas. What we have in our data looks very similar to the
case when lambda equals one. So when is Poisson distribution useful? When we model
the events such as, the number of meteorites greater than one meter diameter, that strike the earth in a year. These are fairly rare
events and we want to model the count, how many times it happens in a given year. Poisson distribution is useful, or the number of patients
arriving in an ER, between 10:00- 11:00 pm, that's fixed time interval. The number of laser photons
hitting a detector in a particular time
interval can also be modeled as a Poisson
distribution. Lastly, in our case, the number of traffic
tickets a driver receives in a month can be modeled as
a Poisson distribution. That's the second technical
point and you'll be able to practice Poisson regressions
in this data set. The last point is
about standard errors. We know that standard errors essentially measures how
precise our estimates are. It's important to get it right. In the homework
assignment we ask you to cluster the standard errors
at the cell phone level. If you read the paper and
go through the tables, you see that in every
regression table, the standard errors are clustered at the
cell phone level. Why would we want to
cluster standard errors? I'm going to give
you two reasons. This is the state of art about why you might want two
cluster standard errors. One is the sampling design
reason for clustering. This applies mostly
with survey data, but it's a good starting point. For instance, your regression
equation is log wages. Here we go, log again, log transformation and on the right-hand side you can think about factors that might affect someone's wages such as
their education, proxied by the use of schooling on their experience and
we might consider, let's say, experience enters
non-linearly so we also include a quadratic term
which is experience squared plus the error term. You want to say something about the association between
schooling and wages in a particular population
and you're using a random sample of workers
from this population. If your sampling method is
at the individual level, then there's no need to adjust the standard
errors for clustering. You can just go ahead
and run this regression. However, if the way
you sample is by randomly sampling 100 villages
from within that country, and then randomly sampling
people in each village and your goal is to say
something about the returns to education
in the overall population. Here you should cluster the standard errors by
village since there are villages in the population of interest beyond those
seen in the sample. In other words, the unit of
randomization is extremely important in terms of determining when to cluster and how to
cluster your standard errors. The second reason for
clustering standard errors, which is the reason that we're concerned with in this
particular experiment, is the experiment design
reason for clustering. Again, we're going to look at log wages and we're going
to write an equation where suppose you have a control and a treatment and in
the treatment condition, you might give extra
encouragements, for instance, to workers in
the treatment condition. If the treatment is assigned at the individual level, again, there is no need to cluster
the standard errors unless you're using
multiple time periods. If your treatment is assigned
at the village level, then you need to
cluster by village. Again your unit of
random assignment is usually where it's recommended you cluster the standard errors. In assignment 1, we say please cluster standard errors
at the cell phone level because each car is associated with a
cell phone number and sometimes if a family
has multiple cars, you can have two
cars or three cars associated with a particular
cell phone number. The reason we want to cluster the standard errors
at the cell phone level is to allow for the
potential correlation of behavior within a cluster. Let's say a family owns two cars and they're registered with
the same cell phone number. The number of tickets that
the cell phone receives, you should allow the possibility that the same driver
sometimes drives one car, sometimes drives another car so the behavior across the
two cars are correlated. Clustering the standard
errors basically say that we allow behavior or observations to be
correlated within the cluster but independent
across the cluster. This is the reason
for us to cluster. I'm done with the
technical points about homework assignment 1, but before I log off, I would like to talk a little bit about homework assignment 4. For those of you
who looked ahead, you probably realized that homework assignment 4 is
very different probably from any other homework
assignment that you have encountered in
the math sequence. There, instead of giving you
a data set or asking you to write analysis programs
with everything specified, we ask you to design
your own experiment and so it's a good idea to
start thinking about ideas. You have learned various types of experimental designs from 630, 631, and now 688. There are lots of
different ways to nudge pro-social behavior to design using data science for
social good and so you might have a problem in your
organization or school, or in your city or town that you might be
interested in solving. It's a good idea to
come to office hours with either the GSI or me to
discuss these ideas early. If our office hours don't work, if you don't find any of
these work for your schedule, feel free to schedule an extra office hour
with one of us. I just want to put it out there and encourage you to attend office hours and
to start thinking about your own
experiment design early.
