Hi, everyone. We're going to continue
with the theory part. But this time we're going to discuss
analytical frameworks from economics. So identity economics started with
Akerlof and Kranton in their paper that was published in the year 2000 in
the Quarterly Journal of Economics. So we'll start with this one,
which is economics and identity. So we defined group identity
as a person's sense of self derived from group membership. You can correspondingly define
a person's personal identity. The reason for
incorporating an identity into economic analysis is that it expands
the scope of the analysis. For instance, it can explain
behavior that appears detrimental, and it can underlie a new
type of externality. Identity reveals a new way that
preferences can be changed, and the choice of identity
can be thought of as some of the most important economic
decisions that people make. So the basic research question is, how does identity,
influence economic outcomes? So there's several different
ways of modeling is. So what we're going to be introduced
to is the preference based approach. And there's also a complimentary
approach which model how identity affect people's beliefs. It's algebraically more complicated. So we're just going to restrict ourselves
to this preference based approach. And essentially,
what you will see is that we're going to add new components to
an individual's utility function. And so their actions would be affected by, their identity and
the norms associated with the identity. So this part, the theory part is,
not required for this course. But it is useful to think
about how one might go through the logic of how identity affects
economic actions and outcomes. So a person's identity or
self image is represented by a function I. So this is person J's identity. So it's Ij. And it's a function of several components. So the a's are actions. So a j is your own action and
a- j is a vector of others' actions. C is social categories. So Cj is person J's social categories and her assignment for
everybody else in the population. And what's importantly is this argument p. Where Akerlof and
Kranton call prescription. So this is the ideal or
the prescription of behavior for a particular social category,
or for each social category. So it indicates the appropriate
behaviors for people. So one can think of that as norms or
stereotypes. So what does a utility function
with identity look like? In general, the utility function that used
to be only a function of my actions and other people's actions now
has this new component, I j. And so the maximization problem is
that an individual chooses actions to maximize their utility,
given the categorization right, the group that he or she belongs to cj.. And p is the prescription of behavior, as well as the externality that one
imposes on others and vice versa. So beyond choosing actions to some extent, people can also choose
their social categories. For instance, they can naturalize and
become citizens of a new country. They can also join clubs or
join social groups. And by doing that, that they affect
their identity and identity utility. So I'm not going to go through
the technical details, but rather we're going to look at
how identity can affect contracts. So what we have talked about is to
set up the utility function and show that identity affect economic
behavior through four venues. One is identity changes the payoffs
from one's own actions, and it can change payoffs
from others action. So that's the externality part. And, the choice of different
identities can affect an individual's economic behavior. The social categories and behavioral
prescriptions can also be changed and affect identity based preferences. So we're going to look at a concrete
example, which is from the 2005 paper called Identity and
the Economics of Organizations. So organizations managers, for instance, often have to confront the issue
of how to motivate and incentivize the workforce. One blunt instrument is monetary payoffs,
salaries. You can adjust people's salaries and
bonuses, but that typically can only
based on observables and is often an imperfect indicator
of individual effort. And it also creates opportunities for
workers to game the system. So most jobs involve multiple tasks. Workers might outperform
on well rewarded tasks, and under perform on poorly rewarded tasks. You can set up strong,
incentive schemes such as tournaments, but that creates incentives
to sabotage each other. Sometimes monitoring incentives
can crowd out other incentives. So what we're going to do is to apply
identity to contract theory and ask ourselves whether identity
can be a complement or substitute for monetary rewards. And what identity can do to reward
schedules and how far identity can go. What we're going to do is to set up what's
called a principal agent framework. This is a canonical model that looks
at contracts between a firm and a worker under asymmetric information. So the idea is that the principal or the firm doesn't know
everything about the worker. So the firm doesn't know the manager. So I use all these terms the principle,
the firm, the manager interchangeably. They might not know the worker's
skill level, and it's very difficult to monitor the workers' efforts,
or very costly to monitor that. So whether the question is,
can you set up a contract so that it is in the worker's
own interests to do the best they can to exert high effort? So we're going to set up the optimization
problem from the firm's perspective. So let's say a firm maximizes
its expected profit, which is the expected revenue
net of expected wage payments. And a worker maximizes
her expected utility. Here we assume diminishing
marginal utility from income and losses of utility from effort. So effort, in a way is a dis-utility
workers can take two actions. A high effort action, which we denote
by A, and a low effort action B. So the assumption is that
the high effort action increases the likelihood that the firm's
revenue will take on a high value. Importantly, the firm cannot observe
the effort of the agent, but it can observe whether
the revenues are high or low. And, the firm will pay a high wage
when it observes high revenue and a low wage when it observes low revenues. So that's the setup. And now we're going to introduce some
notations and incorporating identity. So a worker can take on
one of two identities. So we call c, as the workers category
is N for insider and O for outsider. So an insider identifies with the firm, and an outsider doesn't
identify with the firm. So this all seems to be
simplifying assumptions. But I think the beauty of it,
it can illustrate the logic fairly well. So there are two prescriptions. So an insider should take
the high effort action. So these are the ideals or
the norms of behavior. So the high effort action is denoted A,
which leads to high revenue with probability a half and
low revenue would probably to half. So this just tries to capture some
uncertainty about the realization. Sometimes you do your best,
but things don't work out. But if you never try,
it would never work out. So, an outsider, on the other hand,
should do the low effort action, which is denoted B. And so,
that the B always leads to lower revenue. The effort level is denoted by e,
for effort. And so e of A is greater than e of B. So the workers utility
depends on her income, y? So it's log of y. So it's a very simple, functional form, capturing diminishing
returns minus the effort. So that its constant cost of effort. Ic, is the worker's identity. So the last two terms capture
both the identity and the norms. So minus t of c. So tc is how strongly the identity
affects your pay off. So there is a norm
associated with category C. So we call it e star for
the ideal minus e. So what's in the absolute
value term e star minus e is the deviation from the ideal effort. And that for someone who cares about their identity reduces the utility for
this worker. So now we're going to set
up the optimal contract. So P is the principal or the firm, so p chooses a high wage wH
when observing hi revenue or high profit, high H and
a low wage wl when observing pi l. And p maximizes expected profit
subject to two constraints. The first constraint is called individual
rationality, or IR constraints. Which basically says that I would
rather sign the contract than rejecting the contract. So this ensures that the worker
voluntarily participate in the contract. The second one is called the incentive
compatibility, or IC constraints. Which is in this particular context,
the worker is better off taking on the high effort
action than low effort action. So what you see in the next three
lines of equation is the firm or the principal maximizes expected profit. Which is the first term is when
the worker takes on high effort, the firm will get high revenue or low
revenue, each with probability, a half. And also, you have to subtract
the expected payout to the worker. So what the principle is
trying to do here is, the principal is trying to
induce high effort, right? So how would he or she induce high effort? There has to be two constraints. So the first constraint is when
the worker exerts high effort, it should be better for
the worker than the outside option. So we denote the outside option as UR. So if if we break down
this first constraint so such that is short for,
s.t., is such that. So that starts the constraints. So if you exert high effort, it only work out half of the times
that the firm achieves higher revenue. And so when that happens,
you get paid high wages, but that only happens with probably to half. So it's half times log of wH. And the other times you you actually, the
outcome is not good, despite your efforts. So it's plus half times log of wL. And then the last constraint, the last line of the equation
basically says that as a principal, I want the worker to behave such
that high effort gives on average a higher expected utility for
the worker than low effort. So once we set this up,
we can actually solve it. So we can solve for equilibrium wages. So you here, you can try it out
yourself if you're interested. And the paper also has the proofs. But we can solve for
the optimal wages for, the old workers, which is the outsider,
people who don't identify with the firm. We can also solve it for the insider. Once we solve for the optimal wages,
we can compare them. So the implications is what we call
,you can do all sorts of comparison. So first you can look at how much
variation there is, a more insiders. It turns out that, the wage variation for the insiders is lower. So when you observe a good
outcome versus a bad outcome, you don't have to pay the person
generating the good outcome. Very high wage premium for the person to
induce the person to exert higher effort. The other effect,
that comes out of this identity incorporation into the model
is that the principal doesn't have to pay as much at the top. So in other words, within the firm,
there will be less inequality in income. And the last point is that,
through a Taylor series expansion, one can derive that in general, the principal doesn't have to
pay as much in expected wage. So this basically says
that in the long run, or overall, it actually
is to the principal or the firm, or
the managers benefit to induce, workers to identify with the firm. So to convert newcomers
from outsiders to insiders, there are all sorts of good outcomes. So that's the basic idea of the model. So one thing that you might say is,
gee, I could have guessed all that. [LAUGH] And I'm just going, if you're
thinking about that, I'm just going to go back and say, can you tell me what
the sufficient conditions are for you to get all these outcomes. These are the set of outcomes
that only hold under a very specific set of sufficient conditions. And even though it has not required,
I'm hoping that you will find it useful to
look at why it makes sense for organizations to expand resources to
create identity or work identity. So what we have done in this unit is to incorporate identity into
the utility function. And that gives us a new
set of perspectives and tools about how we might model
various things like contracts. We can think of identity as playing an
important role in people's preferences and decision making processes that have
been ignored in at least neoclassical economics. And nowadays,
there has been a fairly large literature on the what's called identity economics.
