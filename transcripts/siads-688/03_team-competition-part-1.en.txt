Hi everyone. We wrapped up the theories of identity from both psychology
and economics. Now we're going to take a look at some exciting
applied research. We'll start by looking
at lab experiments. How does identity relate
to providing social good. We're going to take
a look at one of the earlier experiments conducted by Catherine Eckel
and Philip Grossman, then looks at identity and public goods
provision in the lab. The title of the paper is called managing diversity by
creating team identity. The title is actually
meaningful in terms of us thinking about
the applications. What motivated the researchers is the fact that the
workforce is increasingly heterogeneous and diverse and the production is
increasingly in teams. We know that group identity in theory could
affect productivity. However, heterogeneous
groups lack a common group identity. What are some of the good ways to create strong group identities? The way they create identity is to assign subjects
to teams and look at the extent to which
team identity can either deter shirting or free riding. They focus on public goods or joint goods and team production. These are pure public goods. The background is in lots of voluntary contribution to
public goods game so VCMs. Cooperation is often increased by repeated play by stable group, pre-play communication or
cheap talk or same-sex groups. The observation is, even though these studies did not start
by looking at identity, all of these things could
increase group identity. The basic group structure
in this experiment is, for each cohort they
have 20 subjects and they randomly assign
them to one of four groups. Then they run the standard VCM or the linear
public goods game, but framed it as team production. The groups are anonymous and is repeated play within
the same group. They practice one round and
play for 15 rounds for cash. The incentives are controlled. The experiment design is such that each subject has allocated a 100 work units and they can allocate them between
a leisure activity. You can think of that as
your private account, which earns $0.005 per unit, or teamwork which earns a penny per unit for the team and is
shared among team members. We can put that into
the perspective of what we've done before
in, let's say, 631. In 631 you did a linear
public goods game and I reproduce the
payoff function here. The incentives here
are exactly the same. Notice that the return, your private account
is about twice as much as the returns from
the public account. We know that the
dominant strategy in our linear public goods game
is to contribute nothing, and that is still the dominant
strategy in this setting. However, when there are
at least two people, the pareto optimal outcome
is to contribute everything. This is the setting where self-interest and group
interests are in conflict. There are six treatments
all together with the first three are what the authors
labeled as weak identity. The last three or the
strong identity treatments. In the first treatment, groups are randomly assigned
there's no group identifier. They just go ahead
and do their work. In the second one, groups are again
assigned randomly and each person
has a colored tag, so there's a group identifier. The third one has a trivia quiz, so group assignment is
based on the trivia quiz, and there's also a
group identifier. Here are the three week
identity treatments and there are also three
strong identity treatments. The fourth one after being
randomly assigned to groups, they have a group
identifier and they have to do a puzzle solving
task together. Then the fifth one is that
they have a teamwork wage. In other words, there's additional private incentive
to contribute to teamwork. The sixth one has tournaments
in the sense that, every one from the winning
team would get one dollar per person and everyone from the losing team will lose
a dollar per person. The incentives gets
increasingly strong. This is a summary of
what the authors find. You can also disaggregate the six different
treatments which is reported in their paper. But what they find is that strong identity lead to significantly higher levels
of contribution to teamwork. On the horizontal axis
you have the rounds. There are 15 rounds. On the vertical axis you have
the contributions teamwork. The downward trend should
not be surprising. This is what we observed
in our experiment in 631 as well. The blue line is the
weak identity treatments and the red one is the
strong identity treatments. At any given round, the more contributions to teamwork in the strong
identity treatments. What we concluded from
this experiment is that simple team identification does not improve cooperation. Thinking back to the Tajfel
and Turner experiments. It is not minimum group because
my allocation decisions, my choices involves trade offs between myself interest,
and group interest. It violates the fourth
criteria for a minimum groups. The other party is unrelated
to group tasks such as, a group solving a
puzzle together, or group communication. But usually a
problem-solving task tend to significantly increase
cooperative tendencies. The last point is that tournament is
sometimes unnecessary. Tournaments does give you a
strong bump at the beginning, but the effect wears off. This is an influential experiment in the study of group
identity for social good.
