Hi, everyone, this week we're
going to start a new topic, which is social identity for social good. We're going to spend some time
talking about the theory, and then talk about the applications. So this is the outline
of this week's talk, so I will start by discussing how
social identity theory came about, especially in social psychology. So the paper that we're going to
study is social identity theory of intergroup behavior, by Tajfel and Turner. How do we define social identity? It is a person's sense of self
derived from group membership, and inherently,
it is multidimensional and dynamic. So your identity could include your race,
your gender, your occupation, and
many, many dimensions. So here I'd like everybody to
do a very simple exercise, which is to answer the question, who am I? You can take out a sheet of paper, and write down the first five
sentences that come to your mind. So we're going to pause here for
a minute, and wait for everyone to finish this exercise. I'm going to briefly introduce social
identity research in psychology, Harry Tajfel, who is a pioneer in
this research, grew up in Paris and was trained as a chemist,
in his undergraduate studies. Then Germany invaded France,
and he was recruited to the French army, and
became a prisoner of war. He survived the war by claiming to be
a Catholic, he came from a Jewish family. After the war when he went back home, he found that his extended family
members have been murdered by the Nazis. So, he decided to go to graduate
school but study social psychology. In his earlier experiments, he asked a very simple question,
which is, what does it take for members of one group to discriminate
against a member of another group? And he came up with this
minimum group paradigm, which is meant to be a control condition. So, what does the minimum
group paradigm involved? So, subjects come into the lab, they're randomly assigned to
groups based on trivial tasks. There's no social interaction
during the experiment, and group membership is anonymous. And lastly, there's no link between
someone's self interest and their choices, and notice the last one is actually fairly
difficult in most real world scenarios. To his surprise, that what he
envisioned to be the control group already generate ingroup favoritism and
outgroup discrimination. In lots of experiments or settings, the
fourth criteria is almost always violated, so if it satisfies the first three,
we call it the near minimum group. So, here's an example of the type
of allocations that Tajfel and co authors implemented, which is called
the other-other allocation task. So everyone is supposed to allocate tokens
to two other anonymous participants, no one is allowed to allocate
tokens to themselves. The number of tokens changes
from round to round, and that it is incentive compatible, in the sense that the amount
of tokens you receive is going to be converted to cash at
a pre announced fixed rate. So this is one scenario for
one round of allocations, and this is what we meant by in-group
favoritism and out-group discrimination. So the data is taken from
a lab experiment that Chen and Li conducted,
at the University of Michigan. So you see three panels,
on the left panel you see the participants allocate tokens between
two in-group members, and there's no difference, right? The blue diamonds represent
tokens to in-group other, and the pink ones are the tokens
to out-group other. The middle panel is allocations
to two out-group members, again, there's no difference. And the difference really shows up
in the third, in the right panel, which looks at how people allocate tokens
between in-group and in out-group member. And the blue diamonds are tokens
allocated to the in-group other, although this is someone who is anonymous,
and who you probably have never met. So people consistently allocate
more tokens to the in-group member. So this is just one example of
the type of intergroup preferences that people exhibit. Across hundreds,
if not thousands of experiments, people have found that the trivial and
ad hoc intergroup categorization, leads to in-group favoritism and
out-group discrimination. And there are various factors
that either enhance or mitigate group effects,
such as category salience, group status, and the relevance
of the comparison dimensions. So social psychologists have looked at
the social psychological processes, which are involved in the development
of positive group identity. Within the pattern of in-group favoritism,
they find that subjects behave as if they try to maximize
the difference between your own group and the other groups, they act as if they
are competing with the out-group. The second point is that social
categorization, is a cognitive tool that segment, classify, and
order the social environment. And that social groups provide a
systematic orientation for self reference, in the sense that it creates and
defines an individual's place in society. So we just went through
a unit on information nudges, and we realized that social
comparison can be effective. And here social identity and social
comparison actually are closely related. So, in studying the social
identification process, psychologists find the individual
strive to achieve or to maintain positive social identity. And positive identity is based on
favorable comparisons between in-group and some relevant out groups. And that when social
identity is unsatisfactory, individuals will strive either
to leave their existing groups. So there we should expect
to see dynamics or make their existing groups
more positively distinct. So now I'm going to summarize the decades
of research in social psychology, sociology, and to some extent, economics. So identity is an integration of three
processes, one is categorization, the second process is self-evaluation
through social identity, and the third one is
intergroup social comparison. More recent research,
have found that intergroup competition, although that was framed in a very
negative way at the start of the stream of research, for Tajfel and his
co authors to understand discrimination. We could also use intergroup
competition for social good, and in what follows, I'm going to discuss
several applications of that.
