We're going to continue
our discussion of teams in the provision
of public goods. In this case, we will move
to the context of Wikipedia, which is an example of
a pure public good, and discuss the group
structure there. So, in that context is
called WikiProjects. The paper that we're
going to discuss is 'Ren et al 2016'. The title of the paper
is "The Impact and Evolution of Group Diversity in Online Open Collaboration". Everyone's familiar
with Wikipedia, which is the free encyclopedia. At this point, Wikipedia is just a little over 20 years old. It is one of the most popular
websites in the world, and I think if you look
at all the websites, it's probably around
number six at this point. The English language
Wikipedia alone has more than 6 million articles, and they are of
different quality. If you look at the evolution
of Wikipedia editors, this is a well-known
paper by Halfaker and is called the "Rise and
Fall" in its title. The Wikipedia started
in the year 2001. In the first half, up to 2007, what you see is a
convex function. Their rapid growth in terms
of the number of editors. It reached its peak in 2007, and afterwards you see a decline in terms of the number of
active editors per year. There are various ways
to explain the decline, and Wikipedia or the
Wikimedia Foundation, which is the non-profit
organization behind Wikipedia, has various components and structures which tried to
sustain editors contributions, and one of them is
called WikiProjects. WikiProjects is, in a
way you can think of that as a team
structure on Wikipedia, but they're organized
by interests, topics and the type of tasks. Usually a group of editors might form a WikiProject such
as WikiProject economics, that would oversee and coordinate their editing effort on the Wikipedia articles in
the domain of economics. You might have
WikiProjects Pittsburgh, which collects all sorts of articles related to Pittsburgh. The research questions raised in this paper is on
diversity, which is, what's the impact of
individual tenure, interpersonal dissimilarity,
past productivity, project involvement and communication on
various outcomes, such as productivity
and withdrawal. Both at the project level
and at the Wikipedia level. This is one way to think
about an implicit model. WikiProjects are
interests groups, so teams where people can
voluntarily join or withdraw. The group's culture would
determine who gets attracted, who joins the project, as well as attrition, which is, who leaves the project. It's also interesting to investigate why they join
or leave the project. This is a history of WikiProjects
between 2002 and 2007. This is essentially the
dataset based on which the analysis and inferences
were drawn in this paper. If you look at the
left hand side, the vertical axis on
the left-hand side, you have the number of projects. What you see is up
to 1400 projects. Nowadays, there are
about 2000 projects. On the right-hand side, the scale is different. You see the number of editors, and for both the
number of projects and the number of editors
had been growing quite rapidly over the years. The analysis in this
paper was based on a January 2008 data dump
of the English Wikipedia. This is again, if
you're thinking about your class project to a Capstone project after
you finish this course, this is an excellent
source of data because the Wikimedia
Foundation made it's entire history of editing
of publicly available. What the authors have
done is to look at all the page edit history
since the creation of Wikipedia to the end of 2007. In your homework assignment
by the way for this week, we'll give you a more recent
dumb but it's processed. To make meaningful inferences
the authors excluded, we keep projects that have fewer than three members
that is none topical. For instance, their
task specific it's focused on citation cleanups and if there is membership lists, they also delete that
project from the dataset. In the end, they have 648 WikiProjects
and 14,464 editors. The Analysis model that they use is hierarchical
linear models. In this set of analysis, they look at two
dependent variables. One is the editor's productivity both at the project level
and Wikipedia level. The project level productivity is defined as the number of edits on articles within the scope of a WikiProject
during the current quarter, whereas at the Wikipedia level, it would be the number of edits on all Wikipedia articles. The other flip side of editor productivity
is editor withdrawal. You can either look at project
level or Wikipedia level. It's a dummy variable that
equals one if active members stop contributing
or zero otherwise. At the Wikipedia level, you define a dummy variable
that equals one if users stops contributing
to all Wikipedia pages. These are the outcome
variables of interest. In terms of factors that affect productivity
and withdrawal, the authors looked
at tenure which is the number of
days that the member joined Wikipedia and
tenure dissimilarity. In the title you
remember there was the mention of
diversity and there's very specific measures
of diversity. Tenure dissimilarity
is essentially a measure of diversity
in experiences. This is the Euclidean
distance metric compared to other members
within a project. We're going to define this
a little more precisely. Past productivity is
the past number of edits on articles
within a project, and concurrent project
is the total number of projects in which an editor
is involved at a time. Project communication
is the edits on a user's pages made by others who are in
the same project. You can think of this variable
as an approximation of the amount of communication and the activity level
within this project. Whereas out project communication
is defined by edits on a user's page or pages made by others who
are not in the project. These are imagine
communication with people outside of
particular project. The covariates or the independent variables
include the following; one is the quarter index. These are 90-day periods
from the project's creation. Depending on which
field you come from, you can think of this as a
time or quarter fix effects. Another one is project scope which is the number of
articles within a project. A project size is the number of members
during each quarter. What we should be a little bit cautious about what
projects size tell us because projects size and to some extent project scope
are endogenous variables. Measurements include tenure
within the WikiProjects. You can think of that as
someone's WikiProject age. That's measured as days
since becoming a member of the WikiProject or the
number of total edits within the scope of the project. The coefficient of variation will give you this
measure which is D_i, the person i's 10-year
minus the mean of the group of the
project squared, divided by the total
number of members. You can think of
that as per capita, and then normalize by the mean. Another measure is
tenure dissimilarity. Again, it's measured by the difference square
between members, i and j, another member in the group summed over or the group members, and divide it by n. These are some of the
diversity metrics. We first look at productivity
verses withdrawal results. This is the results of a regression, rather
for regressions. You look at the first outcome variable or dependent variable is project-level productivity, the second one is
project-level withdraw, the third one is Wikipedia
level productivity, and the last column is
Wikipedia level withdraw. We'll look at the fact of different variables or different factors
on these outcomes. The first one we're going to highlight is in-project
communication. Intuitively, what
you would imagine, I can write down model, is that there are lots
of communication within the group that should be conducive to group-level
project level productivity, and it should be negatively
correlated with withdrawal, and you see both of
these are significant. Then what about Wikipedia level productivity,
and withdrawal, it largely reflects the
same set of effects which is in-project communication has a positive effect on
Wikipedia level productivity, and is negatively correlated with Wikipedia level withdrawal. We can then look at the
10-year dissimilarity, and pass productivity measures as well as out-project
communication. Let's take a look at
tenure dissimilarity. This is the diversity measure. You have some experienced people, and some inexperienced
people within the project. It turns out that if you
look at the linear model, it has a positive effect on both project and Wikipedia
level productivity, and it's interesting that it seems to have a positive
effect on withdrawal. This in some ways tells you that maybe the linear model is
not quite the right model, and indeed one of
the conclusions is that the effect of diversity or 10-year level dissimilarity is actually a non-linear
quadratic function, has quadratic effects on the project level
productivity, and so on. The last one, the
last highlighted, independent variable is
out-project communication which turns out to have a positive effect on
project level productivity, and in some ways a bit strange on the project
level withdrawal as well. These are assuming that
each of the factors enters into the regression
equation in a linear fashion. Let's take a look at some of the more micro-level results. Sometimes editors make edits, and they were reverted. What's the effect of reversion? It turns out that it has
all sorts of bad outcomes. In each of the panels, you can see two lines, one is a sodded line which is, what if there was no reversion versus the dotted
line at the bottom, which is, if there
is a reversion, so I'm just going to highlight
the quality of work. If you look at the
overall quality of work, if someone is reverted, which is at the bottom, you see a sharp drop in
the quality of work, but it slightly rises over time. Whereas if they did
not get reverted, the quality of work increases always, all with experience. Now, we're going to, again, look at these two
outcome variables. Group productivity,
and member withdrawal, and then look at the
quadratic regression, where some of the variables enter as a quadratic function. That captures any
nonlinear effects. The control variables
include: project size, project scope,
project create date, and the level of controversy. The level of
controversy is captured by the relative
number of reverts. What you see here, this is
the punchline of the paper. On the horizontal axis is
different levels of diversity, that's in these specific
cases, tenure diversity, and on the vertical axis on the left side is productivity, on the right side, the vertical axis indicates
the level of withdrawal. If you look at the blue line, which is productivity or the total number of edits
at the project level, it turns out that
it's not linear. The level increases
with tenure diversity, so having a mix of experienced editors and newbies
is good for productivity, and the up to a certain point, and the peak is
somewhere around 0.7, that actually came down. Which means that
after the peak point, there's a decreasing return
to tenure diversity. On the withdrawal side, it's also interesting
that the level of withdrawal is also low
around the mid-range, so it's around 0.5, 0.6, that's when it reach
the lowest level, you want low levels
of withdrawal. Then too much tenure diversity
is actually not good in the sense that people
started to withdraw more when the tenure diversity is too large within a project. The last main result in this
paper is that if you look at the WikiProjects and
tenure diversity, overtime they're actually
at the beginning. When they first started,
there was a lot of disparity, there was a lot of difference, and over time they all
reached that middle range. It seems that WikProjects somehow self-organized towards the
optimal level of diversity. That is basically the main
conclusions of this paper. Is one of the first papers
that study WikiProjects, and in particular looking at the effect of diversity within project diversity on
various outcomes such as productivity, and retention.
