Hey everyone. I'd like to discuss the last
homework assignment, which is the final
paper for this course. These are the sections which are required
for the final paper. You have an introduction,
literature review, experiment design, conclusion slash
limitations and appendices. The introduction or
motivation essentially is a place where
you want to define the problem. What's the problem? One small example is children
are given planners in elementary schools and expected to plan their homework
and activities. The problem is that
they're terrible about it. The other part about motivating your study is to talk
about who cares, so there are thousands
of children and parents frustrated by this. You want to elaborate it says this is a course
about data science for social good you
want to elaborate the social good aspect
of your problem. In the literature review you
essentially want to talk about what others have done
about a similar problem, and what the open questions are and what you're
going to do about it. What have others done about it? You want to write a short
literature review here, and here we want to ask you to at least
discuss three papers, preferably it is not in the
format of paper 1 says this, paper 2 says this, paper 3 says that. You want to integrate the findings and
the open questions, and what you're
going to do about it is essentially your
overall approach. The design part which is
really the key piece of this paper is about
several parts. Who are the subjects
or participants? How representative they
are, if they're not, just go ahead and say they're not a representative sample
and that's okay too. The key part is your main
experimental variation, and that has to be exogenous. In the past, some of the
experiments proposed were not experiments because there isn't any experimental variation. You also want to define your independent variables
and dependent variables, so the dependent variables are the outcomes that
you are collecting. In our energy conservation papers the sequence of papers
about water consumption, the outcomes are how
much water people consume in their
daily activities. In auctions, if you're
running an auction, lets say a charity
auction on eBay, they can be bids, bidder profits or efficiency. The independent variables are variables that hopefully
are exogenous, so for instance, bidder values, the gender, age, major
education level. It's important to write down explicitly what your
set of hypotheses are. The hypothesis should
come from two sources. One is theory, they can come
from social science theory, economics, psychology, sociology, or empirical
observations. For a theory based experiment, you want to write down what the theoretical predictions are, so these are your hypothesis. Recall that in the first- price sealed-bid auction that we run in 630, 631 actually, the risk-neutral Bayesian
Nash equilibrium bids is supposed to be, n minus one over n
times your value, so n is the number of
bidders in the auction, so it's a very
precise prediction. From an empirical perspective, if you've have experiments
shown in the past that, for instance women
are more risk averse, you can write that down
as a hypothesis as well. Essentially that's
your predictions and what you expect to
happen in your experiments. A critical piece of the
experiment design is you want to calculate the
sample size ahead of time, so this is also called
the power analysis, and you want to what is your ratio of this effect
size to standard deviations. There's a standard way of
calculating sample size which we went through in
631 experiment design. You can also use the data
from previous experiments, so you can use
their variances for your own power calculation
and the effect size. But you cannot use their
sample size because most of the experiments
that have been run and published
are under powered. This is a quick review of
sample size calculation for differences in means
assuming equal variance. You have, let's say
two conditions, a treatment and a
control condition. If you expect them to
have equal variance, and expect no more distribution
of the outcome variables, then the sample size is to split the sample equally across
the two conditions. The formula on the
slide is going to be your sample size for each
experimental condition, and that it depends on
the Sigma-delta ratios. Let me remind you what Delta is, so Delta is the effect size which is the difference
between the treatment and the control mean and Sigma is the standard
deviation in the data. If you don't have any actual data from a similar experiment, you can just say, well, I expect my Sigma
-Delta ratio to be one, six or 10 percent
or seven percent, so it depends on the
type of the experiments. You can specify what your
Sigma- Delta ratio is, and that will give you
a unique sample size. The standard is to
use Alpha equals 0.05 and a power of 80 percent
or Beta equals 20 percent. If you want to be able to detect a half standard deviation change between the control
and the treatment, then the Sigma- Delta
ratio would be two. You can plug it into the formula, you would need 62
observations in each cell, notice that half a standard deviation
difference is quite large, and sometimes we might expect
much smaller effect size. The whole pairs, you're halfway through for your
capstone project, you've designed the experiment
and get feedback on it, and all you need to do now, after this course is
to collect your data. You might be running
your experiments in your organization
by emailing people, randomized people into different
groups and email them, you could also use online subject pools which
are fairly easy to use, and so those include YouGov, prolific, eBay, or
Amazon's Mechanical Turk. In terms of expenses, Amazon's Mechanical Turk
is probably the cheapest, Yougov is probably
the most expensive in terms of how much you're
expected to pay the subjects. If you are planning to use one of the online subject pools and
you need subject payments, you can apply for funding. It's not my budget, but the school for my
undergraduate class, my student project
teams can each get a small amount of research budget to collect their pilot data, and I encourage you
to do that as well. Finally, in this paper you should acknowledge the limitations
of your design, and think about what
might go wrong. It will be fantastic
if you can use this design for your
capstone project, so you are way ahead of everybody because already done
you're halfway through it. The last part is the appendix. Here's where you will want to put down your experimental
instructions, and it could be email
messages to your subjects. Recall for [inaudible] and price. In their appendix, they have
these different versions of letters that they send
out to the residents, so you need to include
let's say if you use email, you have email messages, chew the subjects in the
control condition and those in different treatment
conditions and that's it. I hope you enjoy the course and good luck with
your final project.
