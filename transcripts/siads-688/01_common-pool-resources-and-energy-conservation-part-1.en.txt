Hi, everyone. So, we're going to start
a new topic this week. We'll talk about Common Pool Resources and
Energy Conservation. So this is the outline
of this week's talk. We'll, first review what
common pool resource are. And then go through different ways
of nudging energy conservation. Then we'll talk about a study
that overcomes salience bias. We'll discuss a little bit about what
salience bias is before we go into the details of the study. So, what are common pool resources? In week one, we divided the goods that we consume into roughly four different boxes. And so the division or the classifications
were based on two dimensions. One is whether the consumption
of the goods is rival. So rivalnes is defined as whether
my consumption precludes other people from consuming the same good. And the second dimension is whether
the consumption is excludable. In other words, whether the designer can exclude
some users from consuming the good. And so if a good is both excludable and
rival, then we call them private goods. So the stuff that we
consuming everyday life, for instance, broccoli, breakfast cereal,
these air all private goods. What we're going to talk about
today is common pool resources, these goods are rival, but they're non
excludable or difficult to exclude. So let's take a look at the
characteristics of common pool resources. So the first dimension is that
they're highly rivalrous. The second one is that the ability to
exclude others from consumption is low. In fact, a lot of the environmental and natural resources belong to this
category of common pool resources. So the commons, or fishery, or water, or
forests, are all common pool resources. The problems with common pool resources, is that individual efforts to secure
more benefits from the resource, have the effect of reducing
the benefits received by others. So there's a very well known book
called The Tragedy of the Commons. In the old days when farmers sent
their cattle to the commons to graze, oftentimes they overgrazed and
deplete the commons. In fisheries oftentimes
fishermen overfish, and there are many such problems
such as depleting the aquafind so that the community are depleted of water. So these are all some of the problems
with common pool resources. And so what we're going to do
now is to look at whether we can use data to nudge people's
energy conservation behavior. So I'm going to cover two studies first. And both of these studies are co authored
by Paul Ferraro and Michael Price. And the idea is to use non-pecuniary
strategies to influence behavior. Policymakers often rely on non-pecuniary
measures to manage water supplies, so the traditional strategy has
been price based interventions. So for economists in particular, one can think about a downward
sloping demand curve. If you if you pump up the price,
then you reduce the demand for water. Now we're going to look at
an alternative strategy, which is something that doesn't rely
on money, instead, it relies on nudges. So all through the United States and
many different parts of the world, there's a growing concern about
the availability of fresh water. And the United Nation's Environmental
Program estimates that over two thirds of the world's population will reside
in water stressed areas by 2025. And when you look at the price
mechanism or monetary incentives, it actually have been shown to be of
limited use inducing conservation. Because sometimes demand
is highly inelastic, meaning when you move the price you
cannot move the demand by a lot. The other issue with the price
mechanism is that high user groups tend to be wealthier and
less sensitive to prices. So this study or the sequence of studies, use non-pecuniary strategies
to see whether we can curb consumption, and
to better manage water supplies. So the overall aims of the study
is to examine the effectiveness of non-pecuniary based strategies as means
to manage residential water demand. They conducted two studies. The first one is conducted in Cobb County,
Georgia. In this study, the authors compare
the relative efficacy of norm-based messages and social comparisons
on overall consumption levels. So let's take a look at the first study
which was conducted in Cobb County, Georgia, and
that's part of the metro Atlanta area. So here's some background information. The researchers collaborated with
Cobb County Water Systems or CCWS, to distribute treated surface water
to approximately 170,000 customers. This is the second largest user,
this group of users, there're the second largest user of
public water supply in the state. The other empirical regularity is that
residential use is highly variable, about five percent of
the customers account for approximately 18 percent of overall use. So CCWS obtains water from
disputed surface supplies affected by periodic drought
conditions since 1998. So that prompted initiative to
encourage conservation efforts amongst residential consumers. So they've implemented
tiered-rate pricing systems. They've also started and
conducted several information campaigns to highlight how and
why to conserve water. But because they didn't conduct
randomized controlled trials or field experiments,
it's difficult to look at, to examine, or evaluate the effectiveness
of different strategies. So in this study,
the authors use norm-based messages and social comparisons. Remember, in the first week we
looked at social comparisons in reducing traffic accidents. So, there's a growing body of work,
and economics, and psychology, that examines such strategies in
the context of charitable giving. And these studies focus on decisions of
individuals along the intensive margin, and they often compare willingness to pay
versus willingness to accept disparities. Social psychology literature
also examined the use of norm-based strategies to promote
environmental conservation. They typically have small samples with
individuals who are self selected into the experiment, so in other words,
they recruit volunteers. The other part is that social
psychology studies often rely on self reported measure of behavioral change,
which tend to be not as accurate as actual behavioral measures or
objective measures. So what the authors have done is
to use a natural field experiment. Remember, in 631 experiment design and
analysis, we went through a paper by Harrison List
who give us different categorizations of experiments from lab
experiments to field experiments. So natural field experiments
are characterized by the fact that the households or the participants unaware
that they're part of an experiment. The other very convenient analysis
tool is that the randomization serves as an instrument
that permits us to evaluate the treatment effects relative
to a control condition. It also provides conservative tests
of ability to harness pro social preferences to achieve policy goals. So this study considers individual
with utility defined over two terms. One is consumption utility. The other one is a morality term
that captures non pecuniary effects of consumption decisions. Both terms are defined over an action
which is consumption of water in this context, and the morality term is influenced by
a number of potential factors for instance, the costs and benefits
that the action imposes on others. The extent to which action is observed or
scrutinized by others, and the set of norms that dictates
the acceptability of the actions. So, more concretely, we can use the utility function to
capture these different motivations. So the utility function
index by lower case i for your consumer, i,
is function of the action in this particular case is water
consumption, and n is the norm. Data is a vector of individual
specific characteristics. So if you take a look at n,
n has two components, one is consumption. Consumption depends on a,
how much water you consume and data captures, or the other individual
specific factors minus m term. So mi, which is the morality term,
which is also defined over a your action,
your water consumption and which is the extent to which
the action deviates from the perceived social norm so
that n is short for norm s and data. So what the policy maker could do
is to influence water consumption through strategies that target
the realization of S and n. So, for example, EPA s water
sense campaign requests users to make every drop count and
save water to protect the environment. So the frame conservation
as a social norm. If you increase the realization of n and the associate ID increase
in this utility from, deviation from that social
norm would pump up the M term. In other words, there it will
give you essentially an increase in marginal cost from deviating
from the social norm. Let's take a look and
see how they design the experiment. So the Cobb County water system initiated
a male based conservation education program in the summer of 2007, and
they partner with the researchers. They have 107,000 households randomly
assigned to either the control group or one of the three treatment groups. In 631 we talked about different
types of random assignment. One of them is blocked,
random assignment or sometimes called stratified
random assignment. So this experiment uses
stratified random assignment and also remember that stratification or
blocking increases statistical power. So this is a very good design feature. So the random assignment was
stratified by meter routes, and that ensures that there is
no systematic difference across treatments in the timing
of the meter readings. And it also increases
the precision of estimates. And the idea is that's the same
as saying that it increases statistical power by increasing
the precision of the estimates. So here are the different
experimental conditions. So there is a technical advice letter, so you can think of that as
delivering the information. So it's a two sided tip sheet listing the
most effective ways to reduce water use. And the letters were personalized and sent to households in
the official CCWS envelopes. Then there are two norms conditions
one is called the social norm. In the norms literature is also
called the injunctive norm. This is basically what you should do. So the authors label this
as the week norm treatment. So it augments treatment one,
which is the technical advice letter, but including personally addressed
letters that include norm based appeal. So it says specifically we all need
to work together to use water wisely. Please do not waste water. Remember, every drop counts so in other words is an exaltation
of what you should do. They have another condition,
which is a descriptive norm or social norm through social comparisons. So it augments the norm based letter to
include the comparison of their households with others in the county by saying your
neighbors median consumption is blah. And so the comparison is framed in
a negative way in the sense that you consumed more than X
percent of your neighbors. Remember, in this context,
consuming more water is not good. It's not environmentally friendly. So here are the experimental results. We first look at the summary statistics. What you see are the four experimental
conditions the control group and three different treatment groups. So we have the summer 07 usage
in thousands of gallons. And the last column gives us the
percentage change relative to summer 06. So one question is,
why do they need a control group? The control group is there. Remember to control for time trends. So, for instance, if summer 06 just
happened to be a very dry year, you would have high baseline,
where everybody is using a lot of water. So The control group help us control product changes not
captured by the treatment. And then we have these three
different treatment groups. So this table gives us
the average treatment effects. Where we look at the linear
regression models and what you see here is the constant
as well as a dummy variable or an indicator variable for
each of the treatments. You also have the usage the water
use from May to October 2006 and also water use from April and May 2007. So what you see here that
the Amethi indicator variables for the three treatments. Each of them captures the treatment
effect off that treatment compared to the control condition. The difference across the three
models are whether you control for route fixed effects. So model b controls for
the route fixed effects. And there's also a line which says,
trimming rule, which is whether you exclude the outliers. And this is something that we also
see in the traffic experiment, which is sometimes they're outliers
might completely skew your estimation. So it is fairly common
practice to trim the outlier. So in this study they trimmed the top and bottom quarter percentile
from the data set. And what you see here is the coefficients
of the three indicator variables are or negative, which is good, which, which
says that the treatment has an effect. It reduces water usage. However, the indicator for treatment
one which is the technical advice, is not statistically significant. Whereas that for treatments two and
three are both statistically significant. So let's summarize the results for
the average treatment effects. So the results is consistent
with the hypothesis that moral payoffs influence consumption decisions. And that the non pecuniary costs of
an action are increasing in the extent to which the action is scrutinized and
or deviates from perceived social norm. It turns out that as we've seen
from the regression table, the technical advice by itself
doesn't have a significant effect. But when it's augmented by an appeal
to pro-social preferences or normative messages, it has an effect. And the largest reduction is when you
personalize the letter with social comparison informations. In other words, how you compare with your
neighbors and what's really interesting about this paper is its analysis of
the heterogeneous treatment effects. In other words, we divide people. We divide the entire
sample into two groups. The suspicion is that
the treatments might have different effects on different household types, so they split date the data
into two household types. One type is the low users, whose consumption in summer 2006
was less than the median and high users of those whose
prior usage were about media. And so this is the heterogeneous
treatment effects. What you see here is on the horizontal
axis you have the treatments the technical advice, the week norm or
the injunctive norms. And then to the right,
most you see the strong norm, which is the social comparison condition. So you have a pair of bars for
each condition. The dark one are the low users,
the below median users. Whereas the gray ones are the high
users on the vertical axis, you have the percentage
reduction in water usage. So what you see here is that
the technical advice is not significant. And the effect sizes also quite low. But if you look at the week norm and
the strong norm, especially the strong norm you see that the great bars
are much higher than the black bars. Which means that the effect on
the high users much stronger than the effects on the low users or
the below meeting users. So this highlights an asymmetry
in the effectiveness of conservation programs based
on pro-social appeals. That the message are most salient
among high use households. This is really good, because in the past
we've seen that the high use households are not price elastic in the sense that
these typically are wealthier households. So if you raise the price of water
by 30% they don't really care. And that doesn't affect
how much water they use, whereas norm based messages can induce a significant reduction
in their water usage. So in that sense, it is complimentary
to the price measures or the price based strategies. What we need to be careful about is
if it's non pecuniary incentives, maybe the effect would
deteriorate over time. So one question one open question is
how long does the effect last and how much decay do we
expect in this setting? The follow up study is about exactly that. It will answer the question
about the decay effect.
