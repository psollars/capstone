So we're going to talk about
how one might reduce negative externalities through information nudges. So we'll first define externalities and
give some examples. We'll then move to social comparison
theory and talk about an example where one can reduce negative
externalities through information nudges. So what is an externality? It is either a cost or benefit of any
activity or transaction to a third party who is not directly involved or
engaged in that activity or transaction. So here are some examples where one agent's
value depends on another agent's activity. So let's first consider
the situation about milk. This is actually not true for milk,
in the sense that the value of your milk is the same, whether or
not someone else drinks milk. So we say that milk is a private good, and it does not impose externalities
on other people's consumption. Now the second example is pollution. Let's take the example of a stream. So if some people are dumping
toxins into the stream, then the value of the stream for everybody else who use
that stream is decreased. So pollution in that
case imposes a negative externality on everyone
who uses that stream. The third one is traffic, so
the value of the car or your own driving experience depends on how much congestion
others create in their commute. So, congestion definitely
imposes a negative externality on everybody on the road. Now I'm going to separate positive and
negative externalities. So positive externalities essentially
refer to situations where an external benefit is involved. That an external benefit is
a benefit that an individual firm confers on others without
receiving compensation. So examples include getting a flu shot or
getting vaccinated. If you take the action to get a flu shot, that reduces your likelihood
of getting a flu. And that reduces, let's say,
the viruses that you cough into the air that might cause
other people to become sick. So getting a flu shot, imposes
a positive externality on other people. When positive externality is involved, it turns out that the free market
in equilibrium undersupply the activities that impose
positive externalities. So this is where either
the government can intervene or we can use nudges to
get people to do more. The other side is negative externalities,
which involve an external cost. So an external cost is
a non-compensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. So, for example,
air pollution imposes an external cost on people who breathe dirty air.
Texting while driving is dangerous, and now it is the leading
cause of teen death. So unsafe driving imposes
a negative externality to everyon who are driving on the road. So when negative
externalities are involved, the free market tend to
oversupply activities imposing negative externalities compared
to the efficient amount. This is where either the government
needs to get involved, or individuals, or
nonprofits need to think about nudges or other interventions to reduce
the negative externalities. And so, in general, we say that markets cannot solve
the problems of externalities. Because the free market cannot make
the agents, the economic agents, who are involved in these activities
to internalize these externalities. So now, before we move into an example of using information nudges to
reduce negative externalities, I'm first going to go through
a theory by psychologist Festinger. It's called a theory of
social comparison processes. It turns out that social comparison
is a very powerful tool to get people to conform to good norms. So Festinger's paper, if you get a chance
to read it, is sort of a strange paper. Because it imposes,
it sort of just states a set of hypotheses, without testing them or
without theoretically deriving them. But I will be just stating
his hypotheses and add a little bit of explanation. In the first hypothesis,
he asserts that there exists in the human organism a drive to evaluate
his opinions and his abilities. So basically, people have
the drive to evaluate themselves. And the second hypotheses
talk about when that happens. So to the extent that objective,
non-social means are not available, people evaluate their opinions and
abilities by comparison respectively with the opinions and
abilities of others. In other words, when do people
resort to social comparison? That's when the situation is ambiguous. There is no objective or
well known, well established norms. The third one talk about with
whom do we compare ourselves to? In other words,
who are the comparison targets? And the hypothesis says that
the tendency to compare oneself with some other specific person
decreases as the difference between his opinion or
ability on one's own increases. In other words,
the comparison target should be other people who are similar to yourself,
so the target should be similar others. One of the applications that lots
of people should be familiar with is recommender systems. So when you buy a book from Amazon,
the recommender systems would say, customers who bought A Beautiful Mind
also bought The Turing Machine, and this, this, this book. So the idea is, the fact that
you guys all bought this book, A Beautiful Mind, indicate that
there is some common interests. So this is how Amazon's algorithm
infer that you are somehow similar, and make its recommendation that way. And I'm skipping a bunch of hypothesis
which I think are not so useful. The seventh hypothesis is
about comparison group. So, Festinger says that
any factors which increase the importance of some particular
group as a comparison group for some particular opinion or ability,
will increase the pressure towards conformity concerning that
ability or opinion within that group. Okay, so
this hypothesis seem quite dry but we're going to operationalize these hypothesis in various experiments. More recent developments in social
psychology are also talked about why people do comparison and the efficacy
of various types of social comparison. So for instance, upward comparisons
are used when people try to seek self improvement and downward comparisons
tend to lead to subjective happiness. So the social comparison
is a large literature. And in fact, you have encountered at
least one example of social comparison in 631 when we talked about
the difference in differences estimators. And that context of the dif-in-diff,
the data set that you played with, was a social comparison experiment
that was conducted on movie lens. So now I'm going to present an example. Okay, so you should have
read this paper on perusall. And so I assume that you're familiar with
at least the main idea of this paper. And this is also the dataset used in
this paper is also going to be your first homework assignment. So this is a paper on social
comparison status and driving behavior. And I worked on this with a colleague,
Fangwen Lu from Renmin University and Jinan Zhang who was a student
at Stanford at the time. So this idea of this paper
is to think about whether we can use data and information
to extract effective social comparisons to reduce
negative externality. And the context is traffic violations. The decade that just
ended between 2011 and 2020 was declared as the decade
of action for road safety. In 2010, 1.24 million people
was killed on the road. It was the eighth leading
cause of death globally, and it will become the fifth
leading cause of death by 2030. Middle income countries
were the hardest hit. So middle income countries account for
about 80% of the road deaths, but they only have 50% of
the world's registered vehicles. So the World Health Organization
made several recommendations. So for instance, that countries
should increase road capacities. They should impose
stricter road safety laws, increase penalty for drinking and driving. Increase the use of seatbelts,
helmets and child restraints, or improve the post-crash responses. These are good recommendations,
but they're expensive. So what we decided to do is to look
at information interventions and essentially utilize social comparison
theory that we just discussed. So we're going to look at
within group comparisons, we're also going to look at
between group comparisons. So this essentially taps into
social identity theory and status. So we conducted this experiment in China. I'm going to give a little bit
of background information. So about the private
car ownership in China. So China has seen rapid increases
in private car ownership. So the annual growth rate in recent years
was 24% per year and it's projected to overtake the United States by 2030
in terms of the number of private cars. The social norms regarding driving
was not quite established at the time of our experiment. So that's where social comparisons
potentially could be effective. And another interesting fact
that we took into consideration in our experiment design was that cars
are considered as status symbols. It is a symbol of stability and
maturity and in some ways, marriageability. So the research questions we ask in
this project is what types of social information are effective in
reducing traffic violations and who are influenced by status
in intergroup comparisons? I'm also going to discuss a little bit
about the data analysis techniques. So the field context is
the city of Tsingtao, which is a wealthy coastal city
in the eastern part of China. Some of you might have
heard of Tsingtao beer. So it had a population of
8.7 million people and its per capita GDP is about 2.4
times the national average. In Tsingtao, there were 1.3
million registered cars in 2013. So that's when we worked with
the Tsingtao Police Department. So we impose several criteria for
the sample selection for our intervention. The first one is that they
have to be private cars, so that reduced the sample by about 18%. So we now have 82% of
all the registered cars. We also want that the cars
are registered with a cell phone number. So that's 92% of the private cars and that the particular cell phone
number has to have at least one traffic violations in
the first three quarters of 2013, and that's 45% of the sample. So the total sample size
end up being 395,204 cars, so roughly 400,000. And the other background that
we're going to talk about is how traffic tickets are delivered
by the Tsingtao police. Here in North America,
if you're pulled aside by a police, there is no way that you
somehow weren't aware of it. So but in Tsingtao, it's quite different. So there's extensive use of
electronic devices since 2011. So there are red light cameras, video cameras virtually at all
intersections with traffic lights. So the police department actually
does not send traffic tickets to car owners if the violations
are detected by electronic devices. So the car owners are also not required
to pay fines until inspection time. The inspection time could be biannual, annual or
semiannual depending on your car age. And the car owners can find information
online or by calling, but usually they find the information
when their cars are up for inspection. So here's our experimental design. So our experimental
instrument is text messages sent in the name of
the Tsingtao Police Department. So we collaborated with the police
department and essentially get access. We had access to their database,
so we know how many violations each car had and
other informations about the car. We had one control condition and
five treatment conditions. And so the control condition essentially are the drivers who
received no text messages. The five treatment conditions,
each driver in one of the treatments would
receive two pieces of messages. And I first want to talk about
the allocation of the sample between the control and the treatment. You would notice that the control
condition actually had a very large sample. So it's about 320,000 drivers
who were assigned to control, whereas 75,000 were allocated
to the five treatments. So recall that in experiment design and
analysis, we talked about the power analysis or sympathize calculation that you want
to put most of your observations in the experimental condition
that has a larger variance. The other piece of information that
would be useful is whenever you conduct social comparison experiments and
you send out information about the norm. People's behavior tend to converge to
the norm, which means that the treatments are expected to have smaller variance
compared to the control condition. Therefore, you want to assign most of your
samples to the control condition compared to the treatment. So this account for the unbalanced
control versus treatment, and so the first piece of information
in any text message is essentially establishing authority and
authenticity. So it says, Tsingtao police your
car with license number blah, and this is your real license number, had this many traffic violations in
the first three quarters of 2013. The second piece of information
is specific to each treatment. So the first information, the first piece, essentially calls your attention
because it comes from the police. And, it talks about your license number. So you know this is not spam and that it
has, it tells you about hopefully new information, which is the number of
traffic violations that you have had. So the second piece of information is
really specific to the treatments. So in the own-ticket treatments,
we wrap up by saying, Tsingtao police, please drive safely for
the sake of yourself and others, so we can think of that as exultation. Just do the right thing, and we also have a treatment called own-brand
treatment, where the Tsingtao police said your car brand had an average
of this many traffic violations. Your violations are - depending on what your
violation are - above, about the same, or below your brand average, and
then also wrap up with same exultation: please drive safely for
the sake of yourself and others. And then we have three status treatments, each with about 15,000 observations. So this is about intergroup comparison,
but with status built into it. So the high-status treatment
says among high end cars, a brand with few violations had
an average of 0.6 violations, which are above or
below your brand average. Please drive safely for
the sake of yourself and others. And then we have a medium-status
treatment, among middle range cars 0.6, the low-status treatment says among
economy cars, the average is 0.6. We did not make these up. It turns out that we
browse the database and we computed each car brand's average
number of violations in that database, and we selected three car brands,
which happened to have the same. So this is primarily to
avoid any anchoring effect. So the high end car that
we chose was Rolls-Royce. The middle range car was Skoda and
the economy car was Fukang. So these three cars,
we, our original intervention says that "among Rolls-Royce drivers" but then the police didn't want to
mention any specific car brand. They didn't want to look as if they
were doing advertisements for the brand. So, as you will find out when you
started to run experiments or AB test in your own corporation or
non-profit, that any final experiment design tend
to be a compromise between what's desired from the end of the science
perspective versus what's feasible. Okay, so
the implementation was very quick. It was happened on two
days in October 2013, and we are going to derive
a set of hypotheses. So this is essentially utilizing
the hypothesis or theory from social science theories and experiments and
apply them to the specific setting. So compared to the control, drivers have
fewer traffic violations after receiving a text message about the average
violations of drivers of high-status cars. So notice that each driver
in our sample has had at least one violation,
so 0.6 is less than 1. And high-status also has, we'll see,
has an effect on the behavior of the drivers. And so the first result is computing
the average treatment effect. So this is table four in the paper. So what you see here, we sort of
produce part of table four. What you see here are the treatment dummies
on the left hand side. So the omitted variable
was the control condition. So everything you see here looks at how it
does relative to the control condition. The left panel is what's
called the extensive margin. And the right panel are called
the intensive margin. So when you evaluate experiments there,
these are two things that we often check. The extensive margin just look,
it's a binary variable. Whether people had violations
after being treated. And the intensive margin looks
at the number of violations conditional having at least one
violation post-intervention. If you look at the high-status
treatment dummy, this reports the effect of the behavior
of the high-status drivers compared to the control condition
the month after our intervention. So what we find is, you see the negative
coefficient that the high-status treatment drivers reduced their likelihood
of traffic violation by 0.6 percentage points and the number of violations by 5%
compared to the control group. So that is the average treatment effect. I point out two little things
that I'm going to cover later, it's technical. The first one is what is
in the square brackets? That is what we call the Q values. So you're all familiar with the P values. What the Q values are, are adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing because
we're testing more than one hypotheses. We want to adjust for the fact that, we might get statistical significance,
simply by chance. So this looks at the effect of status. The second hypothesis is
intergroup comparison. We look at gender and car status. So this type of analysis is called
heterogeneous treatment effects. So we're analyzing subgroups. Hypothesis two says that, the high-status
treatment will have stronger influence among male drivers and
drivers of economy cars. So how do we know that. This is from previous lab experiments,
that male subjects tend to be more influenced
by status manipulations. And also for drivers of economy cars
because cars are a status symbol. We anticipate that drivers of economy
cars might be more influenced by this manipulation. Okay, so the second result looks at,
gender and car status. So this is what we call
heterogeneous treatment effects, and is from table six of
the table of the paper. So the dependent variable is the post
intervention number of violations, v. The independent variables
are treatment dummies again. And the omitted variable
is the control group. And so we first break out the treatments,
the effect, by gender, we look at male and female.
We then look at the cars. So the first two specifications look
at whether gender, whether men and women, respond to
the treatments differently. It turns out that yes, so
male drivers of economy cars reduced their likelihood of traffic violations
by 1.4 percentage points and their number of traffic violations by
16% compared to the control group. So column two looks at male drivers, column five looks at
economy car drivers and column six looks at male
drivers of economy cars. And so the effect size increases. And, in the end, the subgroup of male drivers of economy cars has
a very large reduction. So the third hypothesis look
at within-brand comparisons. If you recall Festinger hypotheses, with whom are we comparing ourselves with,
it should be similar others. So the comparison target should be
someone who are similar to ourselves. And what you see here, in this context, what's "similar others"? It could just be
people who drive the same car brand. So in the own-brand treatment
drivers with above-average number of violations will decrease their
number of violations after receiving the text
message from the police. And those who are below-average will
increase their number of violations after receiving the text message. So this probably sounds
familiar because if you recall in the movie lens experiment. We also have this shrinking, there is essentially the contraction
of the distribution. So people who are above might come down
and people who are below went up by a lot. And so,
except that in the movie rating context, rating a lot of movies is good,
whereas in the car accident or car violation context less is better. So what's socially desirable is
different in these two experiments. And so this is your third result,
which is the within-brand comparison. And we see that in columns five and six, the own-brand has a significant reduction of the average number of violations
of those who are above-average. Which is a good thing because,
we want less traffic violations, so
a reduction is good. Whereas for the below-average, it did
not increase either statistically or in terms of absolute value,
there is no perceptible increase. So let me summarize the third result,
which is the within-brand comparison. So drivers with above-average number of
traffic violations significantly reduced their likelihood of violation by 0.8 percentage
points and the number of violations by 6%. Drivers with below-average number of
violations have similar number of violations as those in the control group. Which is good in the sense that, if this manipulation made better drivers decide to have more violations, then the benefit and the cost of the information nudges
would just cancel each other out. So it's good that only
the above-average drivers came down. So let me summarize what we
have found in this project. We find that when you do
within-group comparisons, information on the own-group
average should be provided only to those who have above average number
of violations, so that's a 6% reduction. I also want to say that, this result does not survive multiple
hypothesis testing correction. We'll have more on that later. The inter-group comparison result, for the
status result, we find that high-status role model reduces traffic violations
of male drivers of economy cars by 16%. So that's a very large reduction and
this result is statistically highly significant and that it survives
multiple hypothesis testing correction. We looked at the type of
violations that the drivers had after they receive
these interventions. It turns out that most of
the reduction in violation, in the type of violations, is in speeding,
which point to perhaps attention as the mechanism
driving the results of the nudges.
