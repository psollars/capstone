Hi everyone. We're going to take a look at the robustness check of the real-time feedback
experiment that we discussed about showering. This experiment is conducted
in a different setting in the student residence in the National University
of Singapore. You might have noticed
that there are two features about the Swiss Experiment
conducted in Zurich, that people who participated in the experiment
were volunteers. The other impressive
feature is that the feedback given is
extremely fine-grained. If we want to see how
robust these results are, we want to take a look and see what if there's no selection. If everybody just by default
participate, what happens? Do we still see
such large effects? The second part is, what if the feedback is
not so fine grained? While other
institutional difference is that in Switzerland, it's actually very expensive. Water and energy are
priced pretty high. There is a confound of environmental concerns as
well as self interests, which is, you might be interested to reduce your energy bills. These concerns let
the authors to take a look at very
similar interventions in a completely
different environment. The experiment that we're
going to take a look now is conducted by a different
group of researchers, but the lead author
is Lorenz Goette. The researchers work with the Office of Housing Services at the National
University of Singapore, and a company that provide
the feedback device. What did they study? They looked at 1,200 residents in two residential colleges at NUS. All of them are students at the National University
of Singapore. There's also an interesting
feature that they actually don't pay for water or
energy in any form. That takes away self interest in this energy
conservation behavior. The third feature is that they participate in the experiment without the option to opt out. Everybody, by default, were
opted into the experiments. There was no selection
effect, in other words. This experiment, again
has a control group. The message to the students is to encourage them
to conserve water, and limit their water use
to 28 liters per shower. This is a fairly realistic
goal given the baseline use. The researchers have some
data about baseline use in the months leading to
this intervention. For this group there's
no feedback given. One treatment condition is the what's called the 28 Liter Group. The message to the students is to again encourage them
to conserve water, but limit the water use
to 28 liters per shower, this is a realistic goal, and they have real-time feedback. But the real-time
feedback compared to the Zurich Experiment
is a lot coarser. In other words, there are basically different
light indicators. When you are using between
zero and 16 liters, the light is green and
then it changes to yellow. When you're using
up to 24 liters, it becomes orange and red. Again, it's real-time feedback, but not as fine-grained
as the Zurich Experiment. There is another group which is to limit their water use
to 18 liters per shower. This is unrealistic and what the researchers assess
is that it's fairly difficult to achieve again, so these people have real-time feedback using
the same color threshold. Here's what the shower
heads looked like. The shower heads in action when you're using a small
amount of water. You can see the explanation
in the back wall. For the person taking a shower, it's fairly easy just
to check where you are. This is what happens when it goes more than the minimum
amount, it turns. Orange, and finally it turns red when you're
approaching 20 liters. This is the baseline water
use for this population, and when they implemented
the experiment, 12 devices didn't
connect to the network so they had 302 working devices. What you see here is the
number of showers per day and it's fairly
stable over time. Roughly there are
about 1500 showers per day on a regular workday, about half of the
showers are on weekends. This graph looks fairly familiar in the
sense that you know, everybody started in
the control condition. You see the blue line is the water usage in
the control group whereas the orange line is the 18 liter group and the red line is
the 28 liter group. When the treatment
started you see a gradual separation
of the two groups, the control group versus
the treatment group. This is the regression estimates about water
use per shower. Again, the omitted
variable is the treatment, the control dummy, and you
have two treatment Indicators, the 18 liter group and
the 28 liter group. What you see here is
that there again, we observe large and significant
reductions in water use. Both treatments are
highly effective in reducing water consumption
by about four point five to five gallons
per shower if you look at the the coefficients. That's corresponding
to a reduction of about 15% of water
use and energy use. The surprising outcome is
that the less realistic goal, which is the 18 liter group, actually seems to be
at least from the coefficient estimates looks
like that is more effective. Again, we check the frequency of showers and this shows that it doesn't
change the frequency. This is again trying to
go into the mechanisms, why did we see
water conservation? Is it because people take
fewer showers or is it because they use less
water per shower? It seems to show that
taking fewer showers is not the mechanism and which makes sense because Singapore
is the sub-tropical areas, and so reducing the frequency of showers is not a realistic goal. In last previous analysis such as the Ferraro and Price
paper as well as the first shower experiment
that we saw in Zurich. We saw that the users with
high prior consumption, so the high use group, tend to have a greater effect. The question is whether this
continues in the study. What you see here is a definitive but a
non-parametric estimate of the conservation effect. The blue line on top
is the control group, and again the 18 liter group is the orange line and the red
one is the 28 liter group. On the horizontal axis, you see the baseline
water use of showerhead, and so as you move
towards the right, you see that reduction
in water usage is more, the higher the prior usage is. The downward trend of
the treatment group, again shows us that there is a heterogeneous
treatment effect. In other words, how users
tend to conserve more, which is good to see
that it's fairly robust across studies
and across settings. In terms of magnitude. The magnitude is very similar to different Tiefenbeck et
al that we talked about. Here are some other studies that looks at real-time feedback. This is replicated
in different places, different areas of the world, as well as in different settings. What we have learned today, apart from a lot of
things about the showers, we learned that some of
the effects observed in earlier experiments
have been robust across different geographic
areas and user groups, and that it does not depend
on, for instance selection, and it does not depend
so much on whether you pay for the electricity
or water or not. This set of studies show that real-time interventions is fairly effective
and promising, and perhaps we can use it
in other areas as well. For to nudge healthy behavior and more pro-social behavior.
