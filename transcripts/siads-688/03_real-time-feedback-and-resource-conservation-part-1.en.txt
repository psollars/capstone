Hi everyone. We're going to discuss different
technologies. Remember in Ferrara
Price series of papers, they sent everybody a letter, and they evaluate the effect of the letter on
conservation behavior. We're going to look at
different technologies, and these pair of papers
actually use real-time feedback. Also, you will learn more
about showers in this pair of papers than probably anywhere else in your academic career. One thing to know
is that showering is a resource-intensive activity. A typical shower lasts
only five minutes, but it consumes about 7 percent of a person's daily energy use, and 20 percent of
one's daily water-use. This is based on Swiss
and European data. It is a big ticket item
with regard to energy use. We also realize that showering
is prone to salience bias, and so, let me first define
what salience bias is. The idea is that some of our actions or activities
have a benefit, and a cost, and we tend to put
a lot more weight on the factors which are
immediately present. For instance, the sensation of a warm shower is immediate, you feel it right away, whereas wasting water, who cares, that effect is far away. So that could lead to
salience bias that you might be showering for too long
to be socially optimal. A similar example
is, for instance, you're trying to lose weight, and there is a cake
right in front of you. You know you should not
be eating that cake, but it looks really good, and smells really good, and so, that salience, that
immediate benefit will cause you to put more weight
on it than you should. This is the salience bias. What this pair of study is
trying to do is to reduce the salience bias through real-time feedback
on resource use, so that resource use
which is remote, and it's impact on our environment might be
realized years down the road. What they're trying
to do is to make that really salient so it increases the visibility of the resource use compared to the immediate
benefit of showering. The device that the experimenter used is a smart shower meter. It doesn't really need batteries, and it's both simple
and intuitive. It's fairly easy to understand. What you see here is the
water temperature in Celsius on the top of the meter. The amount of water that you use, and at the bottom, there's also a climate animation, which is, there's a polar bear, and as you use more water, the ice underneath the
polar bear will melt away. So it makes it very salient, the consequences of
your prolonged shower. The other effect is of course, it saves the data of each shower. It gives very detailed
behavioral measure for research and evaluation use. Here are different components
of the real-time feedback. What you see on the very top are the energy efficiency
use classes, so it gives you a grade. This set of field
experiments is conducted by a research team that's
quite interdisciplinary. There's people from
behavioral economics, and information systems, and they collaborate
with the City of Zurich and the Swiss
Federal Office of Energy. Altogether, they
recruited 700 households from the City of Zurich to
participate in the experiment. They use a survey to
screen the participants. So only one-person, two-person
households were recruited. They also have their
prior water usage and demographic status. The participants tend to be younger, they're better educated, and they're less environmentally friendly than the average
Swiss population. Here are the
experimental conditions. Households are randomly assigned
to one of three groups. If you're in the control group, when you take a shower, you only see the water temperature. What you see here is
36 Degrees Celsius. If you're in the real-time
feedback condition, in the first 10 showers, you're also only going to see
the water temperature and then since starting
at the 11th shower, you're going to see the
real-time water usage, and the polar bear,
and as well as the grade for your action. Then there's a second
treatment which is real-time plus pass information. Again, so the first 10 showers, you only see the water temperature
just like the control. Then there's real-time feedback plus the water used
from the last shower. You can compare your behavior
to your previous shower. Very simple design. This is the impact of the treatment to all
the real-time display. What you see here is on
the horizontal axis, you have the number of showers, so there is a
vertical line at 10. Remember in the first 10 showers, everybody in this experiment, including those in the treatment
and control conditions, will only see the
water temperature. What you see here is control behavior is
represented by the blue line. The real time information
is the orange line, and real-time plus past
behavior information is the red dotted line. So in the first 10 periods, they're all crunched
together, which is good. Which means that when you
give them the same feedback, which is the temperature their
behavior is not different. Which means that
randomization seems to work. But the line started
to separate after 10. When the real-time
display kicks in, you see the blue line hovering about the same level
in subsequent showers, whereas the red and the orange started to separate and
they decrease right there. There is a separation
and you see fairly clearly that there's a consistent reduction
in subsequent showers. What's the magnitude? For each shower there were about 0.6 kilowatt hours
of energy saved. That's nearly nine
liters of water. The quantity saved is 3-6 times more than
the previous studies. The previous studies
typically would give you this one-time static intervention and this is a dynamic
real-time intervention. Here's another way to look at the impact of
the intervention. What they showed here is the difference in differences
analysis of the treatments. Remember you'll have
that in 6:30 and 6:31. If you have prior use and
then the treatment kicks in, what you can do is to
take differences twice. The first difference is the difference in use
in the control group. It's called CG. During the intervention
phase minus baseline. So this is, I think in the MovieLens experiment
we say after-minus-before. The second difference is the
difference of that you take first and you look at the same difference
after-minus-before for the treatment condition. Therefore, the treatment
effect would be the change in the difference in the treatment minus the
difference in the control. That's difference in differences. What's the advantage
of a diff-in-diff analysis versus a difference
in means analysis? Remember it's more precise. Both type of estimators
are unbiased, but the diff-in-diff estimator is more precise than the
difference in means estimator. Here is the impact. Instead of in graphics, this is in regression tables. We first look at whether the intervention affect
the number of showers. The dependent variable here is the number of showers
during the study, and this is ordinarily
squares regression. It turns out that
there's no effect. So the two treatment domains, one is real-time intervention, the other one is real-time
and past information. Neither of them is statistically significantly different from the
control condition. So if you also look
at the p-value from the F-tests at the bottom,
they're both pretty big. It doesn't affect how
often people take showers. Where is the channel
for such reductions? Here's the baseline estimate. What you see here is
again, diff-in-diff. Y_it is the experimental outcome
variable of household i, at shower t and the two dummies, t1, it and t_2it are indicator variables for
the treatment onset. Alpha i is the household
fixed effects, ti is the shower, the time fixed effects, and epsilon is the residual. Again, we cluster
the standard errors at the household level. This acknowledge and controls for correlations within
households and across time. But independence
across households. These two terms, or
Beta 1 and Beta 2 captures our treatment effects for each of the
experimental conditions. We then look at the impact
of resource consumption, or again, using the
diff-in-diff estimator. Now, we look at another variable and look at the interaction of the
treatment effects with the fraction of study
completion X. X equals 0 is the first shower in
the intervention phase, and x equals 1 is the
last shower in the study. We use linearized time trend
in the interaction effects. The two coefficients,
Gamma_1 and Gamma_2, indicate by how much the
treatment effect changes from the beginning to
the end of the study. This is the regression table
presentation of the effect, I'm going to go ahead
and move to the figures. What you see here is
the actual water use, during the intervention period. There's a 45-degree line, so this is comparing the actual water use with
the estimated water use. What you see is that
there is a divergence, a clear improvement in the awareness of
resource use through the intervention so you see the blue line diverging
from the orange line. What the researchers also looked at is the heterogeneous
treatment effects. Remember in the Ferraro
and Price paper, they find that the
intervention has a much larger effect
on the high users, those who are above the medium. What you see here is a
similar type of analysis. You look at real-time feedback and the control group
is the blue line, and the red one is the treatment group
with real-time feedback. What you see is again, users with low baseline use has a smaller treatment effect than the average
treatment effect, whereas those with
high baseline use display a much larger
treatment effect. This is consistent with
Ferraro and Price. It also indicates that, if you think about
the high users, they are probably taking
longer showers than necessary, so they have rooms to cut back. This is the regression
analysis for heterogeneity in
treatment effects again using diff-in-diff. There's an interaction
with the baseline use. What you see here is the added control
for mean reversion, or regression to the mean. The baseline use is
normalized to sample mean. The coefficient Beta_1 reflects the treatment effect at
the average baseline use, whereas the coefficient
Beta_2 captures the average mean reversion in all experimental groups during
the intervention phase. The intervention
phase is indicated by this dummy variable or
indicator variable, which is shower above 10. Remember the first 10 showers, there is no intervention and intervention starts
after the first 10. Again, what you see here, there is this Gamma term, and what does this Gamma_1
capture in this case? It captures the
interaction effect of the treatment group with the baseline use over
and up and above Beta_2. This will give us a causal interpretation of the heterogeneous
treatment effects. Here is the result
of the regression, you can see here is the
RTF times baseline use, and is negative and
highly significant. There's also the term
intervention times baseline use, again, negative and
highly significant. In other words, the high-baseline
users or the high users display a significantly
stronger treatment effect. How do we interpret
these results? What we have seen is
the researchers give the consumers or households behavior specific
real-time feedback. What we see is that the
treatment effect here is much larger than what we
found previously, for instance, with latter's,
with static interventions. There are by now several meta studies that looks at various types of nudges, like this information nudges. The typical effect size
is about two percent, whereas in this study
with real-time feedback, the effect size is
about six times larger. It is quite remarkable. The last one is that the conservation effects are
largest for the high users. This is found in many
different studies.
