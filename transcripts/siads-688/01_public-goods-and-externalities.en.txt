Hi, everyone. Welcome to data science for social good. I am Yan Chen. I'm a professor at the School of
Information at the University of Michigan. Today we're going to cover
some basic concepts. We'll start with public goods and
externalities. So this is the outline of today's lecture. So we will talk about user generated
content as privately provided public goods we'll define public goods and
talk about the optimality condition and then we'll go through three
different institutions for providing public goods and
will end with nudges. So the first type of public goods,
which is very, abundant in the information
age is user generated content. So examples include Wikipedia articles, open source software, Amazon or
Yelp product reviews. These artifacts, information artifacts,
are what we call information goods and they're voluntarily provided. So, it's going through what we call
a voluntary contribution mechanism. The consumption of these goods also
satisfie two important properties. One is that they're nonrivalrous in
the sense that my consumption does not diminish other people's consumption. So when I read a Wikipedia article, it doesn't diminish other people's
consumption of the same article. The other property is that
it's nonexcludable, and this is largely by choice in the sense
that, founders of Wikipedia or other sites decided not exclude anyone. In fact, it's quite easy to exclude
by setting up authentication. So these two characters are the
characteristics of pure public goods. So let me first go through
a classifications of the goods we consume
across two dimensions. One dimension is whether
the good is excludable so, in that two by two box we have
whether a good is excludable or nonexcludable. Along the other dimension, we'll look at whether
consumption is rival or not. So the most common type of
consumption goods are what we called private goods in that they're both
excludable and they are rivalrous. So, for instance, an apple is excludable.
I can prevent other people from eating the apple and its rival in the sense that
if I eat the apple, you can't have it. Most private goods, most consumption
goods, satisfy this property. Sometimes the goods are rival,
but they're non-excludable. So this, this is the type that we
call common pool resources, and we'll spend more time in the second lecture
on common pool resources. The second column that we have are goods,
which are non rival. So they're excludable public goods and digital goods - these are excludable,
but non-rival in consumption, and the fourth category is what
we call pure public goods. They're both nonexcludable and
non-rival in consumption. So let me elaborate a little
bit on pure public goods. So pure public goods are goods
which have a high degree of nonrivalrous and
not excludable properties. So examples of pure public
goods include knowledge. National defense is also considered
a traditional type of pure public goods in the sense that we
cannot actually exclude anyone, or it's very expensive to exclude
anyone from the consumption, from the consumption or
the benefit, of national defense. We already discussed Wikipedia articles. They are pure public goods in the sense
that they're not excludable by choice, and they're nonrivalrous, and open source
software follow very similar properties. Excludable public goods are nonrivalrous,
but excludable so examples include national parks,
public libraries or online newspapers, so you have to pay
a ticket to get into a national park. Similarly, when you check out
books from a public library, usually you have to have a library card,
and being a resident in a community typically enables
you to get a library card. Online newspapers is a special category
in the sense that some of them are provided as, non excludable
public goods such as the Guardian. Others, such as the New York Times,
are provided as excludable public goods, but they typically allow you
a certain number of free articles. So, for instance, your first five
articles in a month is free and then, it becomes excludable, so
these are different types of public goods. So when we discuss, public goods we will
first go through a technical condition, which is called the Samuelson Condition,
named after the economist Paul Samuelson. The idea is to figure out when public
goods are provided at an optimal level, and the optimality criteria is
what we call Pareto Optimality and the definition of Pareto Optimality is
that it's provided at a level such that you cannot make anybody better off
without making someone worse off. In other words,
there's no waste in the system, so I'm going to derive the Samuelson
condition, it is not required but in case people want to know, why do
we sometimes need to nudge people to, contribute more to public goods? Why can't we just let people
voluntarily contribute? This is the reason, the underlying reason
so I'm going to go through a simple model. So let's say that we have
a number of consumers. So think about this as consumers of
public goods and private goods. So we index them by 1, 2, I
and we have a number of private goods index from one to m. For this example for this derivation,
I'm going to just use one public good and this is fully generalizable to
an arbitrary number of public goods. So this one public good is y and so
y is the quantity of the public good. Each consumer's utility is
quasilinear with respect to the same numéraire. Numéraire, we can just think of that as money which
is transferrable across consumers. So the consumer's utility
from the public good is u, i of y and
this utility function is concave basically this property captures
decreasing returns and the cost of supplying y
unit of public goods is c of y so that's the cost function.
Where the cost function is assumped to be convex and
twice continuously differential. It can be more general, but this is the condition to ensure
that we have an interior optimum. So in a quasilinear model which says
that there is a linear component, a numéraire, any Pareto optimal allocation
must maximize the aggregate surplus. So the idea of the aggregate surplus is
to think of the social planner, or the website designer, who
would like to maximize the sum of everybody's utility and
notice that when I sum up everybody's utility,
I give everyone equal weight. Of course, you can also give
people differential weights, so that's the first term. And the second term is c of y,
which is the cost of production. So if we take the first-order
condition of this objective function, we will derive the necessary and
sufficient condition for optimality and this condition is called
the Samuelson condition. So on the left-hand side you
have sum of u prime of y, so that the prime is the marginal
utility equals c prime of y, so that's the first derivative
of the cost function. Another way of saying that is
that the sum of the marginal rate of substitution between public and
private goods summed over all consumers equals the marginal
rate of transformation. So that is the Samuelson condition. So I have several remarks
on the Samuelson condition. First we assumed that there
is an interior solution and it's quite straightforward
to allow corner solutions, so you can just write the Samuelson condition
as inequality rather than equality. The other remark is that it's very easy. It's a convenient condition to check for
whether an allocation is efficient. So it is convenient, but
what does the social planner or a designer need to know
to find the optimum? Well, she needs to know a lot. So first of all,
she needs to know the marginal utility for public goods from everyone. The second is that she needs
to know the cost function. So how costly it is to produce. Knowing about preferences about
the marginal utility of everyone is quite daunting, so Samuelson actually speculated
about whether this is feasible. He said, well,
you know you can ask people to report, self-report what their
marginal utility for the public goods is, and
then you can just assign taxes or tasks. But people don't really have
an incentive to report truthfully. So the idea from the Samuelson condition
is perhaps we can fined resource allocation mechanisms that support
the realization of optimal allocations. So we will cover three
different institutions. So the first one is,
of course, the free market. The second one is something
that we see every day, which is voluntary contribution. And the third one is perhaps new to a lot
of people is called the Lindahl solution. So in order to analyze these three
different types of institutions, I'm going to add a little more in
the sense that I'm going to again. You know, we have agents,
we have public goods. Most of these conditions
are quite familiar. The notations are consistent
across these lectures. So the private good we use x to denote
private good, and public good is y. We assume that preferences
are concave again. It captures decreasing
returns in consumption and that the production function is f of y,
it is again concave and twice continuously differentiable. We assume that there's only one
private good and one public, again these are fully generalizeable. So the price of the private good is 1,
p equals 1. The price of the public good we'll
just use q to represent that. The amount of public good that
consumer i wants to buy is m i. So let's first derrive
the market at equilibrium. So in the sense that lots of people would
just say well, you let the market decide what's the optimal amount of public good that should be provided? Since the market is so
good as solving allocation problems for private goods, we can think about
broccoli, apples, breakfast cereal. The government doesn't need to intervene. The market does a pretty good
job of finding the prices and the quantity that people demand. So let's see whether this applies
in the public good context. So let's say that a consumer, demand m i, this amount of public goods and
so what the consumer is doing, so in setting up the market equilibrium,
we're solving essentially three set of problems:
consumers maximize utility, firms maximize profit, in
equilibrium demand equals supply. And that will help us solve and characterize the optimal
level of public goods. So consumers choose how much private good to demand or consume how much public
good, m i, and subject to a budget constraints. So remember the private goods
price is 1 so its 1 times x i plus the public good price, which is q,
q times m i equals omega i, which is the initial endowment,
what the consumer has. And pi i, we think of that as the shares that consumers have in the stock market. Producers would follow a production
function that captures the technology of producing the public
good, F of y equals a times y. So we assume constant returns to scale. Again, it's a simplifying assumption,
and it can be generalized. And the equilibrium demand equals supply. So this sum of the m i's, or
the demand, equals the amount of public goods provided, produced, equals y. So what we're going to do is to plug all
these conditions into the consumer's objective functions. We rewrite it,
we eliminated one variable x and rewrite it, as maximizing u of, now we're replacing, y by
the sum of the demand, sum of m i, and we replace the constraint, the budget constrain, we'll plug it
into the utility function as well. So it's just omega i minus a times m i. So the first-order condition is
characterized by the marginal utility of public minus the marginal
utility of private good times a, which is a parameter from
the production function. So I rearranged the terms and
what I get is the marginal rate of substitution for
each individual consumer, i equals the marginal
rate of transformation. So that sort of look like
the Samuelson condition. And now I'm just going to, but
I remember the Samuelson condition wants me to summarize the marginal
rate of substitution. So I'm just going to summarize
the left-hand side over i, and since the marginal rate of
transformation is the same as just i, the number of consumers, times a. But that is not the marginal
rate of transformation, that is greater than or equal to
the marginal rate of transformation. So this is a technical proof that,
in equilibrium, market equilibrium actually does not
satisfy the Samuelson condition. Because the utility functions are concave, this essentially means that there is
an underprovision of public good. So if you rely on the market
to provide public goods, you would have an underprovision
relative to the efficient level. In other words, there's a market failure. So this is the mathematical reason behind
why we cannot rely on the market to provide public goods,
why we have to do something else. Now we're going to turn into
the second candidate mechanism, which is voluntary contribution. So from now, I'm going to use voluntary contribution mechanisms or
VCM interchangeably. And what I'm going to do is to look at,
what if everybody just decide how much to contribute to
the production of public goods. Is that going to be sufficient? So we set up the problem
again in a very similar way, except that m is now interpreted
as the monetary contribution. So a consumer maximizes
utility by choosing m i, how much to contribute
to the public goods, and how much private goods to consume,
x i, subject to a budget constraint. And there is an additional constraint, which basically says that m i has to be
non-negative, has to be at least 0. This just means, when the basket
pass along, you can put money in or you can put nothing in, but
you cannot take money out. And the producer's problem is the same,
the producer maximizes profit. And in equilibrium, demand equals supply, so we're going through
the same set of derivations, we're going to go through
the first-order conditions. And we will arrive at a very similar
condition, which is the marginal rate of substitution of individual i equals
the marginal rate of transformation. Again, we have underprovision, so either an individual under-contributes,
or contributes nothing, okay? So this is bad, this basically says that
if you rely on voluntary contribution for public goods provision, then you're
going to get inefficient outcomes. And so in a way, it's not surprising. So for instance, if we have a communal
kitchen, and there's a dishwasher, but someone has to put the dirty
dishes into the dishwasher, what we often see is that
the dirty coffee mugs and dirty dishes in the sink, and
oftentimes they don't get cleaned. Because transforming, putting the dirty
dishes into the dishwasher and get out clean dishes,
that's a public good, if you rely on the community
to provide it. By a similar token,
we suspect that the amount of high-quality Wikipedia articles is
probably also underprovided, relative to the amount of consumption,
or the efficiency criteria. Some of you might remember
that in another math course, experiment design and analysis,
you did a moblab experiment, which is a linear public goods experiment. We can also call it voluntary
contribution mechanisms, VCM experiments, and this is a screenshot. So each round, each group member
received the same amount of money. They simultaneously choose how much
to contribute to a public good. And in that experiment, the public
good was a water purification project. Each individual's benefit from
the project is the total group contributions times the rate of return. And here's a cute screenshot
from that experiment. And you see that the rate of return,
in that particular experiment, was 0.5. And you were in four-person groups,
so those were some of the details. You might not remember exactly how
much you earned from that experiment. But let me summarize what we have
learned from literally hundreds and thousands of this type of experiments. So in a typical experiment, VCM,
voluntary contribution to public goods, each participant has 20
tokens in each round, and the tokens can be allocated to
a private account or a group account. In the private account, it's going to
convert to cash at a constant rate. In the group account, everybody gets
a low return to the individual. But there is an additional return that
accrues to each participant in the group, including the contributor, okay? So I'm going to first use a two-person
example to analyze the linear public goods. Suppose player 1 contributes
x1 to the group account, and player 2 contributes x2 tokens
to the group account, and the rate of return is 0.5.
What are individual payoffs? So here are two simple equations. The first one is pi 1,
which is the payoff to player 1. And that's 20 - x1, so
that's what's in your private account, plus 0.5 times what's in the group
account, which is x1 plus x2. Now, if I combine terms,
I will get 20 - 0.5 x1 + 0.5 x2. And player 2's payoff is very similar,
it's symmetric. From player 1's perspective, contributing
any amount x1 reduces her payoff, and any amount contributed by
player 2 increases her payoff. And player 2 has a very similar incentive, which is to set your
own contribution to 0. That's the amount that
maximizes your own payoff. So the dominant strategy is to
contribute nothing to the group account, which is, you know, "let the other peoples
contribute, I should contribute nothing." So that's the selfish, no matter
what the other person does, okay, the strategy that maximizes my own
payoff is to contribute nothing. How about, you have n players? It's easy to see that we can
generate the same condition. So the dominant strategy is still to
contribute nothing to the group account. However, when there
are at least two people, the Pareto optimal outcome
is to contribute everything. So agent i loses 0.5 x, but others gain 0.5 times n x. So the total social value is
greater as x i increases, and each individual is better off too. So this is very much like
a prisoner's dilemma. What's better for the individual,
the best strategy for the individual, is not the best for
the group. What happens in experiments? You probably remember that your group
did not reach the Pareto optimal amount. But we can also take a look and
see what happens elsewhere. Here are some distributions of this
experiment carried out in Bonn, Zürich, Kursk, and so on. And you see that among
the student population, at least, there's a big spike at zero which
means most students contributed nothing. But it's not zero for everyone. So there's some contributions at 10,
some at 20 and a little bit in the middle. When you move to non student populations
which is the kursk data with non students, you actually have more contributions and more people contributing 10 on
more people contributing 20. So there's a lot of heterogeneity in terms
of how people contribute to public goods when the underlying mechanism
is voluntary contributions. Let's take a look at what
happens if you let it repeat. So this is data from Fehr and
Gächter from their 2000 paper. So this is when people are randomly
re-matched with each other every round, which means it's
called the strangers. Every time you meet a stranger each of you
decide how much to contribute. You can see that at the beginning, the
average contribution is about somewhere between six and seven, but eventually
dwindles down to about two in around 10. What about partners? So that's the blue line. The partners basically means that two
people are randomly re-matched and they play each other for all 10 rounds. So in other words, if I'm nice to you, I might expect that you're
nice to be next round. So there's the shadow of the future
which might induce more cooperation. But if we look at the blue line yes,
it's above the red line. At any given round; however,
it also decreases to close to three, which is far away from the Pareto
optimal amount of contribution, which is contributing everything, all
20 tokens. So this basically summarizes what
happens with very well controlled voluntary contribution
public goods experiment that you get some contribution initially, but
you see a steady decline over time. So what have we learned
from the experiments? We learned that theory makes precise
predictions, assuming everyone is selfish, that the dominant strategy in such
mechanisms is to contribute nothing. But what have we learned from data? That more students contribute zero
in the last towards the end and some students contributed everything. You probably experienced that
in your experiments as well. Most students are conditional cooperators
in the sense that if others contribute tthen, I'm going to contribute as well. But if they free-ride,
I'll free-ride as well. But from both theory and the experiment,
we learned that the voluntary contribution mechanism does not
solve the free-rider problem. Especially if we consider that from learning the contributions
steadily go down to close to zero, although in most experiments actually
never go down to completely zero. Now we're going to take
a look at a third concept, which is called Lindahl Equilibrium. So this is, the first quote is from
the Nobel laureate Ken Arrow. He says that if any actor in the economy
cares about something that involves an interaction with at
least one other actor, then there should be a market for that
something, in that it should have a price. So the basic idea of Lindahl Equilibrium
is to set up enough markets. In other words,
instead of having one price for everyone, we set up individualized or
personalized public goods prices. So I'm going to go through
the formal definition and the derivation, which is not required. But in case someone would like to know,
this is the idea and from Lindahl Equilibrium, we're going
to go into more practical lessons. So for Lindahl Equilibrium,
we're going to set up personalized prices. We use q i as thes personalized prices and
that they sum up to q, which remember, q was the price for
the public good. We use y i as individualized
consumption of this public good. We know that in equilibrium,
everybody consume the same quantity, and we want to prove that Lindahl equilibrium
allocation is Pareto optimal. The proof strategy is very similar
in the sense that we first solve the consumers' maximization problem. So consumers maximize utility and then producers maximize profit in
a equilibrium demand equals supply. That means everyone's demand for the public good, the individualized
quantities, happened to be the same. Because we're in the pure public
goods world and if you add up, look at the first order conditions
from the consumer and the producer. It actually gives you the sum of
marginal rate of substitution equals the marginal rate of transformation
which is the Samuelson condition. That means when you have personalized
prices for the public good, it actually would generate the optimal
level of public goods production. So here are some remarks about
Lindahl Equilibrium. If prices are such that all agents choose
the same quantity of public goods, then we get the Samuelson condition. In other words,
Lindahl Equilibrium is pareto optimal. So which is really nice. The key here is to set up enough markets. However, each market is thin in
the sense that there's only one agent in that market and that agent
is a monopsonist. So there's again the incentive to understate demand and
not taking prices as given. So the proofs are all going
along in the flavor of competitive equilibrium price and one key assumption is that
everyone takes price as given. But if I'm a monopsonist,
I don't have the incentive to do that. Traditionally, people tend to think for
a long time. Economist think that the information
required to set up Lindahl prices might not be realistic and
might not be obtainable. But in some context, we actually have
a lot of information about users or consumers to set up personalized prices. So I'm going to give two examples. One is property tax. We know that in the United States,
local governments use property tax to fund
public schools for instance. So public schools are considered
local public goods and every house is assessed and
the property tax differs depending on how
valuable your house is. So in that case, you can think of each
household getting a personalized price. So that that is essentially
your property tax. So in that case, the government, the local government actually has quite
a bit of information about your house. In other settings,
the website designer, for instance, of an online community, also has
a lot of information about each user. At least the designer
knows how much activity the users have conducted
online on that website? And, they can probably infer
the users preferences from those productivity's and the click streams. So this idea of Linda equilibrium,
motivates us to think about, personalized social information nudges. I'm sure everybody has heard
of the idea of nudges. So now I'm going to go ahead and
define nudges. So there is a very well known book,
a best seller, by Richard Thaler and
Cass Sunstein is called Nudge. There are also many academic
papers testing various ideas, various type of nudges. So I'm going to formally define nudges,
so one can think of nudges as
instruments that affect behavior without directly changing prices or
choice sets. So nudges could be information provision, it could be social comparisons,
it could be reminders or different framings, or
you can vary the commitment opportunities. And, we will go through
several examples to show, what type of nudges are influential
that can influence behavior. Nudges are increasingly used
to encourage privately or socially beneficial behaviors. So there are ways to nudge retirement
savings by changing the default. So when you get your first job, the default could be that if you
do nothing, there's nothing. No amount of salary was put into
your retirement savings account. Or the default could be automatically
deducting 5% of your earnings. And put that aside to your
retirement savings account. It turns out that the default
actually changes behavior. It has been used to intervene
to help with smoking succession, environmental conservations, and
charitable giving. There are many different nudges,
One problem I'm sure many people have heard about, the "choice architecture" as
nudges, in the sense that in a cafeteria, you can put the salad first or
you can put the dessert first. It turns out that if you put desert first, students could end up eating a lot
of dessert and not leaving enough on their plate to put on
more healthy options such salad. So this is by looking, changing
the choice architecture. It is so useful that governments
have established nudge units. So, for instance, the UK government,
the US government, and Australian governments - and many others -
have established nudge units. This is basically a group of researchers
who decide how to nudge people into pro social behavior, behavior that's good
for themselves and also good socially. So there are lots of resources, but this is essentially an overview
of what's to come, and we're going to use, essentially,
information data to help us produce nudges that's effective for
social good.
