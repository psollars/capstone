Hi, everyone. I'd like to discuss the third homework
assignment, which is using Kiva data. So the data set is from,
a 2016 PAS paper that recommends teams, and it shows that it
promotes pro social lending. And the main exercise that we're going
to ask you to do is to do the difference in differences regression of
average daily lending amounts. So this is a two stage
least squares regression. So we use instrumental variables to essentially solve
the problem of selection. So the IV, which is exogenously generated
by the experimenter is the email, which is we randomly assign a subset
of the lenders to receive our emails, and another subset did
not receive the email. Remember that we have two stages, so the first stage is called
inclusion restriction. So for IV to be valid,
it has to satisfy both criterion. So you can check that the first
stage is satisfied by checking the F statistics in this case,
it's a large of statistics, so that indicates that email
is a strong instrument. In the second stage, you have to check or argue for exclusion restriction, which says that email by itself
does not increase lending, you have to find a compelling argument for
that and remember that you took SI
at 1631 experiment design. There you were given the same kiva data
set to practice to stage the squares IV regressions. But assuming that exclusion
restriction was satisfied, we now ask you to prove to yourself
that exclusion restriction is indeed satisfied and so
what are you going to prove? You're going to prove that email by
itself does not increase lending. So to do this, we're asking you to use another dataset from a Kiva experiment. So this is something that
researchers do a lot, which is to prove exclusion restriction,
you can find other sources of data. And so
this data set comes from a paper that was published in 2017 by
the same group of authors. So this is a field
experiment where we explore the mechanisms that makes teams work. So we randomly selected 2000
open teams on the platform. We dropped teams with fewer
than five members and ended up with 536 teams. And so this this one involves posting
posting messages on the team forums. Then we randomly assigned these teams to
four treatments and one control condition. At the time of the assignment, the average
team size in our sample was 47 members. So the total number of Kiva
lenders in our experiment in this specific experiment is 22,233. So here's our factorial design. We have essentially a various by messages. So you can look at two by two
factorial design that varies whether the messages is about
coordination or competition. So the NoGoal and
Goal difference is about competition. Whereas the NoLink versus Link
dimension is about coordination and in the control condition,
there is no foreign message. So we control for
someone joining the team. So the way we did it,
we actually created 15 new lender IDs and the names are taken from the 25 most
popular male and female first names and the top 50 most popular last names
based on the 1990 US census. The location for these experimental lenders were
the capital city of each state. We did not provide occupation
information or pictures, and we randomly matched the names
with the locations. So each lender joins 11 teams and each makes alone and
assigned to each team. So the total amount loaned by the
experimenter for this experiment was about $13,000 and we we did have Kiva's
approval for this experiment. So the experimental condition
is essentially these can be characterized by these. So the control condition is our research
assistants who take on these identities, join a team, make a $25 loon and
credited to the team. But the research assistant
says nothing on the forum, in the NoGoal-NoLink treatments
they do everything that the control are aided,
plus an introduction on the forum, which says, hi, I am so and
so and I'm new to the team. I just credited my first loan to the team. Okay, so it's an introduction message. The NoGoal-Link would have introduction
plus a link to a specific loan, So there's a URL for
the team to coordinate, whereas the Goal-NoLink has
the introduction and goal for the team. So the goal is the same across
these different teams, which is, if each of us make a $25 loan in
the next month will improve our rank. And the Goal-Link is a combination of
the NoGoal-Link and Goal-NoLink messages. So what does that mean? We're going to show you an example. So, RRA posted a message
on this forum on this team. So this team is assigned to
the Goal-Link treatment and he says, hi, I'm Paul and I'm new to the team. I just credited my first loan to the team. So up to now,
this is the NoGoal-NoLink message. So this is in every message, then this subsequent one is
specific to this treatment. I learned to Sandra from Colombia. Sandra is asking for a loan of $1400
in order to buy decorative items and aromatherapy products. Here's the URL to her request,
and this is a real URL. And so this is the link. So you have the URL that's used to
coordinate lending in this team and the the next sentence is
about the competition. So that's goal setting. If each of us make a $25 loan in
the next month, will improve our rank. And what happened after RRA posted this
message there's a cascade of messages. So Lender 1 one says, welcome Paula I
added 25 more to send you as well. Good call, Paul. Thanks for sending out the message. I'm in another things and
and so on and so on. And so all these messages on the team's forum are aggregated as one email. So if you belong to the team, you receive
this one email sent to your inbox. Okay, so
here's the combined treatment effect. So the vertical line is the day
we implemented our experiment, and the red one is
the combined treatments. And the grey dotted line
is the control condition. And you see that there is a treatment
effect combined treatment effect. What I'm going to show you now is a definitive regression results, which is one of the table. So if you look at the set
of independent variables, they include the different
experimental conditions. And we're looking at the one day window,
the four day window someday window, 10 day window and 30 day window. Notice that the NoGoal-NoLink which
is the first independent variable. The first treatment has no significant effect on the number of loans
whereas Goal-NoLink and Go-Link. So the two goal setting
treatments both have significant effects even up to 30 days
after someone joins the team. But the important part here is not
to emphasize the treatment effect. Remember, you're looking for
the evidence for exclusion restriction for
your IV regression, which says that on the Kiva platform, email by itself does not
influence lending behavior. So you can use the NoGoal-NoLink
treatment as evidence that the email aggregated
on this teams' forums and sent to the members had
no significant treatment effect compared to the control condition. So these emails have no
effect on lending activities, and that's what you need
to prove to yourself and the outside world that using
email as an instrument actually satisfies
the exclusion restriction. So here are the conclusions from
this experiment, and the paper is also up there with the course material
if you're interested in reading it. But I hope that this brief
introduction is sufficient for you to figure out why we
included this data set. So when you're doing your own research or doing your own implementation
of IV regressions, oftentimes you need to find
data sources to convince yourself that exclusion
restriction is satisfied. And I want to also mention that our
last homework assignment is coming up, and it's about designing
your own experiment. So if you haven't discussed
your ideas with one of us, please do so,
please come to our office hours. Thank you.
