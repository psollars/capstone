Hi everyone. I'd like to discuss the second
homework assignment, where we use the data
from Ferraro and Price. I think the most
interesting finding in this homework assignment is the heterogeneous
treatment effects. We're going to ask you to look at the heterogeneous
treatment effects. What this figure
should remind you of, is the fact that low users
or below median users, those represented
by the dark bar, respond very differently to the treatments than high users, so those whose water usage
is above the median, which is represented
by the gray bars. Officially we call these subgroup analysis heterogeneous
treatment effects. We have practiced a fair amount about estimation of
average treatment effects, and now we're going to consider variability in treatment effects. The question is,
why should we care? As a practitioner, you want
to know what works for whom. From a practical standpoint, those who decide whether to implement a program or policy, want to know which individuals
or which groups of individuals will be most responsive and under
what conditions. From a scientific standpoint, the study of variation in
treatment effects can provide important clues about why a treatment does
or does not work. When we look at
subgroup heterogeneity, sometimes we cut the data by unit characteristics
such as gender, years of education, or income. Sometimes we use context
characteristics, such as unemployment
rate across regions. We might group the low unemployment
rate regions together, and then the high
unemployment rate regions. In the second
homework assignment, we ask you to explore the
heterogeneous treatment effect based on water consumption
in the summer of 2006. We ask you to split the data
into two household types. The low users are defined
as those whose consumption in summer 2006 was less
than the median resident, and the high users are defined as those whose
water consumption in summer 2006 was above
the median resident. The key variable in your dataset to figure out how to cut the data is called percent report,
which is percent_report. If that variable is less than 50, that indicates that this is
a below median household. If it's above 50, it indicates that here's an
above median household. Here's one thing to remember. When we say cut the data, you would never need to actually separate the data
into multiple datasets. Go ahead and use your
conditional commands to do the subgroup analysis. Lastly, I want to
remind everybody again that assignment
4 is coming up, where you will be asked to
design your only experiments. So if you have any ideas, or if you are thinking
about various ideas, please feel free to sign up for office hours
with me or the GSI. If our office hours do
not fit your schedule, please feel free to email us, or contact us on Slack to
set up a new office hour.
