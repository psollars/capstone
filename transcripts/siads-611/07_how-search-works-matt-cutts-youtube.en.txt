Hi, my name is Matt Cutts. I'm an engineer in the
quality group at Google, and I'd like to talk
today about what happens when you do a web search. The first thing to understand is that when you do
a Google search, you aren't actually
searching the web, you're searching Google's
index of the web, or at least as much
of it as we can find. We do this with software
programs called spiders. Spiders start by fetching
a few web pages, then they follow the
links on those pages, and fetch the pages they point to and follow all the
links on those pages, and fetch the pages they link to, and so on until we've indexed a pretty big
chunk of the web, many billions of pages stored across thousands of machines. Now, suppose I want to know
how fast a cheetah can run. I type in my search, say cheetah running speed
and hit return. Our software searches
our index to find every page that includes
those search terms. In this case, there are hundreds of thousands
of possible results. How does Google decide which few documents
I really want? By asking questions, more
than 200 of them, like how many times does this
page contain your key words? Do the words appear in the title, in the URL, directly adjacent? Does the page includes
synonyms for those words? Is this page from
a quality website or is it low-quality,
even spammy? What is this page's page rank? That's a formula invented
by our founders, Larry Page and Sergey
Brin, that rates a web page's importance
by looking at how many outside
links point to it, and how important
those links are. Finally, we combine all those
factors together to produce each page's overall score and send you back
your search results, about half a second after
you submit your search. At Google, we take our
commitment to delivering useful and impartial search
results very seriously. We don't ever accept payment
to add a site to our index, update it more often, or improve its ranking. Let's take a look at
my search results. Each entry includes
a title, a URL, and a snippet of text to help me decide whether this page
is what I'm looking for. I also see links
to similar pages, Google's most recent stored
version of that page, and related searches that
I might want to try next. Sometimes along the right and
at the top, I'll see ads. We take our advertising business
very seriously as well. Both our commitment to deliver the best possible
audience for advertisers, and to strive to only show ads that you really want to see. We're very careful to distinguish your ads from regular
search results. And we won't show you any ads
at all if we can't find any that we think will help you find the information
you're looking for. Which in this case, the
cheetah's top running speed is more than 60 miles an hour. Thanks for watching. I hope this made Google a little bit
more understandable.
