Welcome to SI 611. We're continuing on our quest
to understand advanced SQL. We have stopped worrying
about how portable it is and we're just going
to embrace Postgres. And so the first couple
of weeks of this course are
full-text searches in JSON, searches and
indexes, arranging, indexes that support
all those things. And these are things like you're
going to be pulling a lot of data off of an API or
pulling full text. You're trying to do
sentiment analysis or something and so it
turns out databases are still very good at these kinds of things even though it's not accounting or transaction or credit card transactions
or whatever. Week 3, we switch away from Postgres and we use a
thing called Elasticsearch, and we spend Week 3 looking at NoSQL or non-relational
database systems. This class isn't really all
about that but I want to make sure that you understand that there are
more than one choice. Relational databases
are really useful. There is sort of a buzz about
non-relational databases because of their scalability,
etc., etc. And so we'll talk about
that in Week 3 and then in Week 4 we reconnect
back to pandas and we show you how to
talk from pandas to an SQL database and really we just do some
basic pandas stuff. And so that is I think a nice set of advanced skills and talking
about database architectures. One thing you'll notice is that
the first two lectures are a slightly different format. To sort of let you know how
it is that I build lectures, is that the first thing I do
is I write a bunch of code. Well, I first read up on stuff and research and find reading
lists and things like that, then I write a bunch
of sample code. So the sample code
you see is usually the second thing that I'm
writing and so I'm like, okay. And then the next thing I do is I make a set of
lecture notes, which are just sort of incoherent
stuff that I every time I have an idea I throw it in the idea in my lecture notes. And then what I do is I produce PowerPoint from
those lecture notes, and then I record the PowerPoint lectures
and then I record the walkthroughs and then I make autograders and that's
my methodology. And so I had this idea and you can tell me if you
think it worked or not. But I had this idea that why the lecture notes are
going to be web pages. And instead of using PowerPoint and turning everything
into an image, I wanted to make it
so that you could actually as I lectured have my exact lecture notes up on the screen at the
exact same time. And so we'll see. So there's no PowerPoint
in the first two weeks. In the Week 3 and Week 4 we go
back to good old PowerPoint. But I'm really curious if you find these useful
and then they become web pages and then they
become searchable and they are probably much easier to read and scan for information because you
can search through them more easily than PowerPoint but I don't know if it's a
great idea or not. So I look forward to
some of your feedback. I'm sure we're going to do
this class more than once. But I just wanted to I'm making these really cool
lecture notes and I'm like, ''Why don't I just share the
lecture notes with you?'' So off we go in the second class and really focused on the
advanced features of SQL.
