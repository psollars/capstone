The hangar tour starts with a shot of the
bridge crane used to move the containers. As we pull back,
we get a view of the single story side, which is more clearly seen from
a vantage point on the mezzanine. There are 15 containers on
the single story side and 30 on the opposing two stories. Amongst the safety considerations in using
containers, we include emergency exit stairs and egress pathways, as required
by code at the tail end of the units. This final view gives us an idea
of the scale of the hangar bay. In this segment, we follow one of
our technicians to the container, where he's dispatched to
perform a server replacement. Here, we see him making his
way on his Google provided personal transportation device. He must first verify the machine location. As you see here,
each tray is outfitted with onboard UPS running at greater than 99.5% efficiency. Once inside,
our technician removes the tray blank and installs the repaired server tray. The cold aisle inside the container is
maintained at approximately 27 C, or 81 degrees Fahrenheit, enabled by
attention to good airflow management. Here, we show our idea
of Google nightlife.
