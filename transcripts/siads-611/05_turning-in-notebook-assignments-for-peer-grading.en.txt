Welcome to another walkthrough. In this
walkthrough we're going to show you how to turn in the assignment for the autograder. So if you're in Week 4 and
we've got four assignments in Week 4 and we can't use
the normal autograder. And the reason we can't use
the normal autograder is explained in this page, I'm kind of walking through
the explanation in this page, is because in our notebooks, right? So we have notebooks.
In our notebooks, we are making connections to
servers that are outside this system. And so the submit to the autograder will
not allow you to make those connections, but we're going to set this up. Now this one here, this very first
one, this 01-readonly, this really isn't testing anything other than making
sure that this code is working, right? We can't use the autograder, but we're going to actually instead just
validate it. And you've done this if you played with Python where you're
doing your homework and you do validate. And all we're going to do, and this one
I think is going to work because I have my hidden.py properly set up. Here's hidden_dist. These secrets are correct in
hidden.py. You shouldn't have to make any changes to the 01-readonly
Python notebook. You should be able to just run it. Run, run, run, run so that, now let's look at five. Oh, look at that. So that, is
that the right number? I hope. Yep, that's good. And now this so it's run the autograder
and so I'm actually I've given you the instructor version of an autograded
assignment so you could cheat and you could take the hidden tests out. But
don't do that, just run it. And this worked, otherwise it would complain down here. So the way you can then test it in
the old days if I didn't give you this is the instructor version, but you actually see the hidden test.
The hidden tests aren't that tricky. So what you need to do to get credit
in this is just type validate, which everything except autograde it.
It runs all the tests. And what I want you to do is do this. I want you to take "Success! Your
notebook passes all the tests." I want you to move this to the window down
here and then I want you to screenshot this page, which is which assignment you're
doing, the title and the validation results. I want you to screenshot this page right
here, and then I want you to upload it into here. So you'll go here and you'll go
into this. This is my own peer grading system, which you've already used. And then you're going to take that screenshot
and you are going to upload that. And then we're going to do peer
grading with that screenshot. So that's the key. The key is we get
a nice little screenshot here and then you upload it. And that's how
we're going to autograde these because I can't actually
send them to the autograder, okay? Hope that helps. Let us know
if you have any questions.
