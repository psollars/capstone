The original video explained conceptually
what you'll be doing and why for your assignments. But a few of the requirements
have evolved, we're using a different mechanism, an
external tool grade scope for submissions. And I thought it'd be helpful to provide
a few tips as well as a walkthrough of the mechanics of submitting
your first week's work. Almost everything you submit will be
a section of a single document that you accumulate during the course, your personal manifesto, who you're
going to be as a data scientist. So our first step of course
is to locate the assignment. So here I'm in Week 1 of our course and
scrolling down to find the graded assignment, it's called
Graded External Tool, Week 1 PDF. We have created a Google Doc,
which is a template. You should not be able to edit this, so the first thing you're going to
want to do is make a copy. So you can call it whatever
you want to call it. You'll be sharing it to your Google Drive,
and now you will have edit access, And then you can fill in your name. You can see it's organized into different
weeks, Week 1 to Week 3, Week 4. In Week 1, you have several different
things that you're supposed to do, reading responses, planning for
the informational interview. So you can go down to
any of those sections. In each of those sections
there's instructions. You should feel free to
delete those instructions after you've filled in
the contents if you want to. After you've filled in the contents for
those sections for Week 1, you will want to print,
so File > Print. And Firefox is asking, Where do we want to, what do we want to
do with this file, I want to save it. And I don't actually use
Firefox very often, so I'm not quite sure where it saved it,
but hopefully we will find it. So my next step,
I'm going back to Coursera, and so we're now at this step. We've saved it as a PDF, and
now I have to promise that I'm following the honor code and
I'm going to open the tool. Now it's taken me to an external site,
Gradescope. Here I'm going to click Submit PDF,
not Submit Images. And Week 1 is the name of our assignment,
so it says Submit Week 1 here. I click Submit PDF, and I have to select
a file from somewhere on my file system. I did find that it's here in one we saved, and I click Upload. I'm not quite done yet,
it processes that submission, breaks up the PDF into a set of pages,
and I have one more task here. I have to tell it on which page will
it find my answer to various questions. This is really important for
the graders, and it's a good check for you to make sure that you've actually
completed all of the sections. So the reading responses,
I've got four of them, And they're all on the same page. Informational interview planning, whoops,
that was not questions 1 through 4. I have to select question 5, that's where
the informational interview planning is. Question 6,
the inventory of knowledge and skills. In my case all three of
them are on the same page. In your case they probably won't be
because I've written something there. Then I have the applications, In my case I've got them both on
the same page, you probably won't. Then I've got a question on page 6, and maxim starts on page 6,
continues to page 7, and the ethical commitment is on page 7. The rest of the document, you can
leave it there, it's perfectly fine, just it doesn't have any questions for
this week on it. I'm going to click Submit, and Gradescope's going to be a little worried
here because I have a bunch of pages where I didn't say that there
was anything to be graded. That's, Actually fine because that's stuff that's just template content that you're
going to fill in in a future week. So if you actually manage to
have all of these questions that are associated with some page,
you'll check over here. You'll say I'm good, and
you submit the assignment. You'll notice that Gradescope says
it's ungraded because it hasn't been graded yet. At some point, you'll get a notification
saying, hey, it's been graded. You can go back to Coursera and
click on the same link and it will take you back to your assignment. It will no longer say ungraded there,
it will say that it's graded. And you'll be able to go through
the different questions and see your points and, more importantly,
feedback from the instructors about it. You definitely want to look at those
because, for most of you, your grade's not going to be very good in the first week,
but you're going to get lots of feedback. Don't panic about that, the first three weeks when you
submit stuff, they're graded. But the grades don't count for
very much towards your final course grade. In the final week,
you edit everything you did for the first three weeks, or
at least most of the sections are getting regraded in Week 4,
and then it will count for a lot. The Week 4 submission,
when it's complete and most of the things are getting regraded, that's going to
count for 80% of your course grade. So make sure you look at the comments,
you should look at them. Don't wait till Week 4 because the
comments from Week 1 will help you to do better on your stuff that you submit for
Week 2. But definitely revise when you
resubmit everything in Week 4. Okay, good luck,
use Slack if you're having any trouble or if you have any tips to share with other
students or share them in office hours. Speaking of which, one semester I was
trying to put students at ease in office hours and I said,
any topic is fine, any question is fine. There's no such thing as a dumb question. So a student said, well,
I know I really should've brushed up on my algebra more before
I started this program. But in the math fundamentals
class we got this problem, can you tell me what 5q plus 5q is? No judgement from me, I said, 10q,
and the student said, you're welcome. I'll see you next time.
