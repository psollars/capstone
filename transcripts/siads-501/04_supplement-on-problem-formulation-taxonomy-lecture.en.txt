Welcome back. After having students use this taxonomy
for a few semesters, I've decided that there are some important omissions in it. Here's the supplement with three additional
types of problems. The first is just
descriptive indicators. One or more indicator is that summarized data
streams that may have thresholds to convert those indicators to
discrete values. You may want to provide historical tracking
through graphs or some comparative tables, and you may want alerts
based on thresholds. In terms of the four
stages of a project, the analysis and modeling phase is the least important
in this kind of project. A lot of effort will
go into thinking about what data is available
and how to validate it. A lot of effort will go into thinking about
how to present it and use it as a trigger
for actions or for alerts, but the analysis itself will mostly consist of
summary statistics. Group the items and count
them or take the average. Sometimes there'll be a
slightly more complex model that summarizes
some kind of trend. For example, in the
COVID dashboard, we make use of the CDC algorithm that processes the
history of case counts and produces discrete
outcomes that try to characterize the recent
trend: low incidence growth, or elevated incidence growth, or elevated incidence plateau, or declining for
some number of days. How will you recognize
when you've got one of these descriptive
indicators problems? When decision-makers
say they want a set of key performance indicators or an easy way to decide whether more
attention is needed, the request may even be
to create a dashboard. The second new problem
type is optimization. Optimization is a
technique that's used as part of solving a lot of
data science problems. In this image, the
challenge is to find the x, y coordinates that minimize
the value of the function. But there are certain kinds
of problems that it makes sense to think of the problem as being about optimization. Allocate people to cashiers at the grocery store in a way that minimizes the average wait time. Dynamically set airfares in a
way that maximizes expected revenue or run auctions for ad placements on web pages in a way that maximizes revenue. Optimization has
been the domain of operations research for decades. The Professional Society
for Operations Research, INFORMS has a great slogan, "The science of better." There's been a lot of
research about techniques for specific kinds of
optimization problems, such as queuing problems. You're not going to
learn much about those in this masters program. But data scientists will often work with
operations researchers, and there are many problems
where the goal is to choose the best combination of parameters to achieve
some objective. Operations researchers
are likely to take a mathematical modeling
approach to such problems. Data scientists
are likely to take an empirical,
data-driven approach. When faced with an
optimization problem, it's good to be aware
that sometimes, mathematical models
are a good alternative to the data-driven approach. How to recognize an
optimization problem? Decision-makers have some
leverage that they can control, they want to make
the best choices. Moreover, the notion
of best can be expressed formally as some
kind of objective function. When you have both
of those conditions, you have an optimization problem. Ranking; you'll sort a set of items based on which is most preferred or
most recommended. You'll present just the
highest-ranked items in sorted order. Think of search results from Google or Netflix movie
recommendations or the sorted feeds of
tweets or Facebook posts. To solve ranking problems, you may use techniques like similarity matching or
co-occurrence grouping, but they aren't
fundamentally problems where the goal is similarity
matching or grouping. The goal is to rank well. How do you recognize
a ranking problem? There will be a
large set of items only a few of them are to
be presented at a time. You may hear terms like
recommendation systems or recommender systems
ranking or best matches. That's a few more problem
types to add to the taxonomy. Descriptive indicators,
which may be used as part of alerting
systems are dashboards, optimization problems, ranking problems.
Here's a little joke. This time, the joke is on
us, the data scientists. Six data scientists and six operations researchers were going to a conference by train. One by one, the data scientist go up to the ticket
counter and buy a ticket, but only one of the
operations researchers does. The data scientists are
puzzled and they look at the operations
researchers and one of them says, "Optimization." They all get on the car and
the data scientists sit down. The operations
researchers, they post one person at either
end of the car. After a while, one of
them shouts, "Conductor." On that queue, all of the
operations researchers pile into a restroom and
lock themselves inside. The conductor comes
through, he gets people's tickets,
he's clicking them. He gets to the bathroom
and he knocks on the door. They slide a ticket
under the door. The conductor takes it, clicks it, slides at back. The data scientists
looked at each other, they're quite impressed, and they all go to
the conference, and they have a good time, then it's time to go back home. They go to the train station and one data scientist buys a ticket. The rest don't, and they all look at each other and giggle. The operations researchers,
none of them buys a ticket. The data scientists
are puzzled again and the same operations
researcher looks at them and says, "Optimization." They get on the train, all the operations researcher
sit down this time. The data scientists
place a person at either end of the car
and at some point, one of them yells, "Conductor." All the data scientists pile into the bathroom,
and they lock it. The operations researchers
just sit there. A minute later, the
operations researcher, one of them knocks on the door of the bathroom and
says, "Tickets, please." A ticket slides under the door. He picks it up and all of the operations
researchers go into the other bathroom and lock the door. I'll see you next time.
