Welcome back everyone. Pretty much everything
we need to say about correlation and causation is summarized in this XKCD Comic. A guy says, ''I used to think correlation
implied causation, but then I took a statistics
class and now I don't." His friends says, ''It sounds
like the class helped.'' "Well, maybe." This lecture is
just a cautionary tale and one that you've
probably heard before. So I'll try to make it fun and memorable and I'll try not to laugh too hard if some of the stories correlations
that I show you. The end of this lecture,
you should be able to recognize when
you're automatically assuming causation or leading
others to assume causation, even though you've only
observed a correlation. You should be able to explain
the idea of a confounder, a variable that influences both the independent
and dependent variable, and why it makes it
dangerous to infer causation from correlation
between those two variables. So intuitively, correlation means two variables move together. With positive correlation,
like we see here, when one variable is higher than its mean the other one tends to also be
higher than its mean. With negative correlation,
when one variable is higher, the other one tends to be lower. Now there are
several reasons why you might observe that
two things are correlated. One of course is causation. For example, the
temperature tends to be higher during the day
time than nighttime, because the energy from the sun
causes it to get hotter. But there are
other reasons that you might observe a correlation. One is that two things
share a common cause, what's called the confounder. For example, if we take monthly sales of ice cream and monthly sales of down coats, we're likely to find
a negative correlation. It's not so much that
eating ice cream makes you not want to buy a coat. In fact, eating ice cream
makes you cold, so you should want to coat. Both sales trends are
caused by the same thing, by a common confounder, the seasonal temperature changes, at least if you live
in a place like Michigan where we have
cold winters and hot summers. So in this situation, season would be
a confounder influencing both ice cream purchases
and down coat purchases. If you don't somehow control for that confounder in your analysis, you'll risk misinterpreting
the negative correlation between ice cream and coat sales. Another reason for observing the correlation would be
just random happenstance. In the previous lecture,
we talked about the dangers of multiple
comparisons and p-hacking. If you compare enough pairs of variables and you don't have too many data
points for each, you might find some pairs
that are correlated, green jelly beans and acne. This is especially true, if you're taking time
series data where there may be a natural linear trend, you might say time passing is causing both quantities
to go up over time. That's the source for most of the spurious correlations on this really fun website we've
assigned you to look at, here are a couple
of my favorites. Honey produced in
bee colonies in the US, that's the blue line, and money spent on admission to spectator sports in the United
States from 2000 to 2009. Now it turns out over time
there's been a problem, there's a been a blight
for honey bees and so honey bee production
has gone down. Over that same period of time, more people have gone to
spectator sports in the US, so we have an increase. But if we just look at it as
a correlation, my goodness, is the attendance of the spectator sports causing
the bee colonies to decline? Well maybe, it's
the other way around. Maybe the bee colonies
were preventing people from going and now that there's
fewer bee colonies, people are going to
see spectator sports. So you might be tempted to make a causal story out of this but really it's just both trends
in time unfolding. Here's another one that's fun. Computer science
doctorates awarded between 2000 and 2009
basically on an upward trend. Also, total revenue generated
by arcades going up. You might be tempted to
tell some causal story that computer science
doctorates are the people who were
mostly going to arcades and they're not
actually doing any work. They're no studying, they're
just going to arcades. Or maybe your theory
is that people getting more computer science doctorates have caused arcade games
to be more fun, so now they're
getting more revenue. But probably that's
just a spurious correlation, even though it's
a very high correlation, 98.5 percent,
probably not causal. We've assigned for
reading this week a blog post with an example
where causation is more plausible than those
two and that's where our minds will naturally jump
to telling a causal story. It turns out that students who study abroad are more
likely to graduate on time and to find employment
immediately after graduation. A university's
study abroad off as presented this information
in a way that encouraged a causal explanation. Studying abroad causes good graduation and
employment outcomes. But there's a more
plausible story in which that causal link
isn't really true. Students who are doing well in college are the ones who consider and are accepted
for study abroad. They would have had good graduation and
employment outcomes whether they went abroad or not. So be a good student
is a confounder for both graduating and
studying abroad. Now I want to give you
one cautionary note when you're reading
that blog post. It concludes by saying
that the only way to make a legitimate
causal inference is with a randomized
controlled trial. That's not quite true. We'll talk about
this little more in the lecture on confounding
and you'll take a whole course in this program
on causal inference. By now you should have your guard up to notice when you
see a correlation, to think of possible confounders, and avoid making
unwarranted causal inferences. So here are a couple of maxims. Correlation doesn't
imply causation, and a question, what are
some potential confounders? Now, many of you were
probably sensitized to these issues already
but not everyone is and you sometimes may have to sensitize others in your job, and it may help you
to have a story you can tell that's personal. So here's a challenge for you. What's the time when
you incorrectly assume causation even momentarily when you heard about a correlation? Here's one of mine. I teach an intro programming
course on campus, now also available
on Coursera the Python 3 programming
specialization, and we have an online
interactive textbook. Because it's online, we get electronic traces of
student activity, timestamps for when
they load pages, when they run code samples. So I wrote a program to estimate how much time
each student was spending using the textbook based on those electronic traces, and then I correlated
the time spent in the textbook with
the students performance on exams in the course. Now I spent a lot
of effort on making that textbook and
I really wanted to believe it was
helpful for students. But when I first
ran the analysis, I didn't find any correlation
between time spent using the textbook and
exam performance, and I immediately made
a causal inference in my head that the textbook had no effect on
student learning. Because if it did, I would
have seen a correlation, and I was really disappointed. But then I looked
a little closer. It turns out that prior programming experience might have been a confounder. I had some students who
already knew how to program. Some of them really well, don't ask me why they were
taking an intro course, I try to shoo them
away every semester. But there's a few of them
every semester and they tend to spend less time in the textbook but do really well on the exams. Among everyone else, there
was a positive correlation. So what's your embarrassing
story of incorrectly assuming causation or lack thereof based on a correlation,
or lack thereof. I'll look forward to
reading about it on Slack or hearing about it
in office hours. I'll see you next time.
