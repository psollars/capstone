Welcome back everybody. See you've completed
your data analysis. Time to pack up and move
onto the next project. Maybe not quite yet. Your data and models aren't going to speak
for themselves. This week we'll talk
about stage four, Turning your analysis into
something that changes minds, changes decisions,
changes actions. As with other weeks, our
learning objectives this week focus on general perspectives rather than specific techniques. At the end of
this week you should appreciate the need
for telling stories, appreciate the need
for making your models understandable and for conveying uncertainty and doing
it in concrete terms. You should understand
the engineering challenges of
putting a model into production and the ecosystem of other roles that
a data scientist interacts with. There's a video lecture
for each of those five, each with short
readings accompanying. So in a previous lecture, I promised a really
complicated wordplay joke. I think this one is
the top of the heap. What is the difference
between a prince, a bald-headed man,
a monkey, and an orphan? Well, the first is
an error apparent. The second has no apparent hair. The third has a hairy
apparent and the last has nary apparent. I'll
see you next time.
