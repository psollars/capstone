Welcome back. Let's talk about presenting the results of
your analysis to clients. At the end of this lecture, you should appreciate
the need for storytelling, you should be able to
unpack these "SUCCESS," acronym ; simple,
unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional,
Stories, and you should be able to describe
the components of a storyline; situation, characters
especially a hero, problems, solutions,
and next steps. In the Declaration of
Independence in 1776, the founders of the United States declared some truths
to be self-evident. Of course that they
felt the need to declare them in writing, suggests that perhaps
they were not so self-evident at the time. Likewise, the truth
that emerge from data analysis will
not be self-evident. Your models won't
speak for themselves, you'll have to speak truth in a way that listeners
can understand. One of your readings
for this week tells a cautionary tale about a truth that was
not self-evident even, after someone had assembled
good data in support of it. In the middle of
the 1800s in Vienna, Ignaz Semmelweis had
the radical idea that cleaning medical
instruments after autopsies, not to mention physicians washing their hands, would
be a good idea, and acting on that idea he
managed to radically reduce the childbed fever rates in a maternity clinic
in his hospital, the deaths from childbed fever. But he didn't manage to convince everyone
else of his theory and he ended up getting
sick in the hospital, the death rates went back up. I don't pick he made
a graph like this one, or maybe he just didn't have a good grasp side manner to go along with his bedside manner, but in any case,
the medical community rejected his insight
for decades to come with continued
unnecessary mortality. So the data is not going
to speak for itself. How can you make it
speak to your audience? Well, here's
a little acronym to help you remember some
heuristics, SUCCESS. This will help you make
your presentation of data more impactful or
presentation of anything really. So the first S in
success is simple. I like to say that you
should issue obfuscation, you can go look up those words. Really just means keep it simple. Your presentation should pass the Inter Ocular Trauma test, meaning the results should hit you right between the eyes. Hey, look out behind you. Your presentation should have
something that's unexpected, some surprise, and that's
the you in SUCCESS. The first C is concrete. I'll have more to say about
that in particular when we discuss how to present
uncertainty in a later lecture. The second C is credible, should present
enough evidence to make your results credible
despite being unexpected, and the more unexpected
your results are, the more skeptical
people should be. So you're going to
have to present enough evidence to
make it credible. Should make an emotional,
create discomfort, joy, sadness, anger, relief, anxiety. No, I laughed, I cried. The final S is for stories. Present your results
using stories. So what is a story? Well, the storyline is going to have some situation or setting, it's going to have characters
especially a hero, a problem and a solution
and next steps. You'll have a reading about this, but I want to just add one point is a way to
think about this is, what is the story of and
who's going to be the hero? You may be tempted
to make it the story of your data analysis
with you as the hero. I'd like to suggest that that's
not the right way to go, the hero is not you the analyst. The hero should be
someone who has a problem that you're
data analysis solves. For example, the director of our outreach program
has a problem. She needs to show
that our program of sending social workers out for follow-up visits
to people who read recently visited the emergency room, that it's worthwhile. Because if she doesn't manage
to convince the higher-ups, the hospitals can
cut the program. It turns out after you do your data analysis
the amount of money that was saved from
the program actually doesn't justify
the program financially, but you've developed
a predictive model that will help target
the program more effectively and the director
will now be able to make a good case for
continuing the program. So in this case, it's a story of a threat to this program in the hospital and you're data analysis
helps the hero, the program director
to save the program. Now, there are also interesting stories that can be told about your data analysis process. We had a lot of trouble
getting the data we needed, but then we discovered that the operations logs
actually had a lot of it and after days and days
of debugging my Python code, I was able to extract
what we needed. That would be as story
where you're the hero and if the story about
the data analysis process. Those stories can be engaging, but they often detract from presenting the results which
should be your real focus. You may have taken along and maybe interesting journey to
get to your final results, but your audience really
doesn't need to take the same long journey
that you did. Tell a story of the results and how they
can affect decision-making. So to summarize, here's
some maxims that you might use as things to come back to to summarize some
of these ideas. First, the truth is
not self-evident, the data doesn't
speak for itself, the models don't
speak for themselves, the results don't
speak for themselves. A picture is worth 1,000 words. Tell the story. You are not
the hero of your story. I'll finish with
a little data story from our old friend
the XKCD comic strip. By the way, the XKCD is my
go-to mostly because it's so insightful and funny and just captures the ethos of Geekdom. But also because the author is very generous
with licensing which allows us to use
it without paying or going through some
complex permissions process. So thanks Randall Munroe. So here's our closing story. Guy goes to his
girlfriend and says, "I think we should
give it another shot." She says, "No, we
should break up. I can prove it." Shows him a little graph of
their relationship over time just going downhill. He looks at and says,
"Maybe you're right." she's, "I knew data
would convince you." He says, "No, I just think I can do better
than someone who doesn't label her axes on our graph."
I'll see you next time.
