Hi, welcome to week three, where we're focusing on the analysis
phase of data science projects. As always in this intro course,
we're building up vocabulary and concepts not teaching specific techniques. I'll often refer to pairwise correlation
and simple linear regression as analysis techniques just to be concrete because
those are things I'm assuming you've already been exposed to in
a prerequisite stats course. But the concepts I'll be talking
about are more general and will come up in other types
of analysis that you do. At the end of this week, you should be
able to get started on an analysis for any of the problem types in the taxonomy
that we had from week one, and know what some of the techniques are,
even if you're not yet ready at this point in your studies
to do all of those techniques. At the end of this week, you should be
able to explain the following concepts, overfitting, signal and
noise, cross-validation, the problem of multiple comparisons,
P hacking, confounding, conditioning on a third variable and
Simpsons Paradox. And you should be aware of
some related vocabulary, maybe not necessarily able to explain
it clearly yet to others, but you should at least be aware of
this vocabulary of regularization, the bias-variance tradeoff,
mediators and colliders. Finally at the end of this week, you should be able to recognize when
you're automatically assuming causation or leading others to assume causation, even
though you've only observed a correlation. To become a data scientist,
you'll have to start thinking in terms of some of these concepts to be recognized as
a data scientist by others, you'll have to incorporate these into your vocabulary and
that's going to take some practice. You're going to have to try using them and accept that initially,
you might get it wrong. So you're going to have to try using
the term overfitting maybe even in your everyday life, but do a little check to
make sure that you're using it correctly. So to get some practice, use
the communication channels that we have, the slack office hours and so on,
use those as an opportunity to test out your understanding of
the concepts and vocabulary. Please do try to correct each other,
gently of course, it's also okay to be wrong
in an attempted correction. We're going to be monitoring
with being instructional team, we'll be watching out for
interesting discussions and trying to keep things on track,
so give it a shot. The homework on developing content for
your manifesto also continues to be structured around giving you practice
at using and applying the concepts and vocabulary. You'll be assessing your knowledge and
and making plans for where to acquire it, especially about the repertoire
of analysis techniques. And you'll be filling in
questions maxim's and ethical commitments related
to the data analysis phase. As always, these can come from things
you glean from these video lectures or things you glean from interviews
of data scientists or things that you compose yourself. There are five more video lectures for this week each with short
readings accompanying them. The first, revisits the taxonomy of
problem types from week one, naming and giving some intuitions about some of the
analysis techniques that are appropriate for each problem type. The rest, I'll look at common
pitfalls in data analysis and some of the approaches to preventing them. One video lecture looks at
the danger of overfitting and an antidote cross-validation. Another looks at the problem
of multiple comparisons and the potentially creates for
interpreting noises signal. A third one looks at the dangers of
assuming causation based on correlation with some humorous examples
of spurious correlations. And the last one examines
Simpsons Paradox and points out that you should condition your
analysis on confounding variables, but should not condition your analysis
on mediators and colliders. So we're not going into a lot of
technical depth in this course, but this week we'll be dealing
with some deep concepts. I've really enjoyed
preparing these lectures. It's involved a lot of digging around, discovering new levels of
understanding for myself. I hope you'll enjoy digging in as well. And I hope you'll use these lectures as
a springboard rather than as an endpoint. All of these concepts will come up again
often repeatedly throughout your program. Since when do the data
analysis part of this course, let me close with a statistician joke. There was a statistics professor
who when driving his car, he'd always accelerate really hard
before coming to any intersection. He whips straight through it and then slow down again once he
got past the intersection. And one day, he takes a passenger, and the passenger was understandably
a little unnerved by his driving style. He asked him, why do you go so
fast through these intersections? The statistics Professor replied,
well, this is strictly speaking. You're far more likely to have
an accident during an intersection. So I just make sure that
I spend less time there. I'll see you next time.
