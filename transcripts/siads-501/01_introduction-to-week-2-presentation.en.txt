Welcome back for week 2. At the end of this week, you should be
able to explain the danger of making inferences about a population
from a small sample. You should be able to correctly
use the term selection bias, self-selection bias and survivorship
bias to describe situations where making inferences from non-representative
data can create problems. You should be wary of reproducing
incorrect inferences if training data are labeled incorrectly and you should
be wary of creating unfair outcomes if those two problems together
lead to worse outcomes for some groups of people than for others. At the end of this week, you should have
accepted the hard truth that you will spend significant effort on the seemingly
mundane task of data cleaning. You should have become aware of some
of the basic activities of cleaning and you should have gained an appreciation of
the importance of doing collection and cleaning in a reproducible way. We have three big Ideas this week. The first one is getting enough data. There's a law of large numbers that
says the mean of a sample converges to the mean of the overall
population as the sample gets big. The law of small numbers is sort of a
tongue-in-cheek version that says the mean of a small sample is a good estimate of
the mean of the population, but it isn't. Right, you'll have a lecture video for
that idea. We're assigning you chapter ten from
Kahneman's book Thinking, Fast and Slow and there's an optional Jupyter
notebook to help develop your intuitions about how often you'll be wrong. If you make inferences from
data sets that are too small. The second big idea is
getting the right data. You might have unrepresentative data. Let's say you carefully study the
relationship between painkiller dosage and perceive pain, but
you only study it for men. You still might not know much about
that same relationship for women. Again, there's a lecture video. There's a reading that provides
a taxonomy of statistical bias types. And then there is an optional reading
about algorithmic bias or societal and fairness such as unfairness to women and
minorities that can result from many things but especially from
unrepresentative training data. The third big idea is data cleaning. Did you know that in data science 80% of
your time is spent preparing data and the other 20% of the time is spent
complaining about the need to prepare the data? Now, seriously, data scientists do
spend a lot of time acquiring and preparing the data. You have to link up data from various
sources, identify outliers and missing data and investigate the reasons. So for this idea, there's going to be
a lecture video and then readings on data cleaning and on good practices for
making sure that whatever you do during the cleaning stage is re-runnable so
that your results are reproducible. Let me close with a little story
where a statistician is the hero. So a retired statistician, he purchased a brass Aladdin's
lamp at an antique shop one day. Being very proud of the purchase, he cradled the lamp with one arm against
his chest and began to walk home. He'd only walked a block when he was
startled by a belch of smoke from the lamp and out comes the magic Genie. Hello kind sir said the genie. I am here to grant you three wishes,
since you have toiled your entire life with numbers to benefit people
in many, many different professions, the only provision is that these
wishes have to also benefit others. And to ensure that this happens, you see those three lawyers walking
on the other side of the street? Each of them will receive
double what you receive. Now, the statistician recalled some
bad experiences with lawyers, but he's still pretty excited and
he agree to the conditions that the genie smile gleefully and
says, what's your first wish? The statistician thought for
a minute and responded, I would like a brand-new red Ferrari,
poof, sparkling red Ferrari appears. He looks across the street and saw six
of them, two for each of the lawyers. The genie smiled, said,
what would you like for your second wish? With very little thought, the statistician
said, I'd like a million dollars, poof, a million dollars
appeared in a gilded suitcase. Of course,
he glances across the street and each of the three lawyers
has two gilded suitcases. And the statistician is starting to
get a little angry because I mean, who likes lawyers and they're
receiving more than their fair share, as perhaps they always do. So the genie then admonished him. He only had one last wish and he should
think very carefully about what he wanted. So the statistician,
he painfully puzzles over it and finally says, you know, all my life,
I've wanted to be an organ donor. So I hereby wish the donation of one
of my kidneys to the local hospital. Poof, a kidney was donated. I'll see you next time.
