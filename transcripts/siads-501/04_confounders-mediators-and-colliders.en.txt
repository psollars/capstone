Welcome back. Last time I introduced the
idea of confounders, and the danger they pose in
interpreting correlations. We're going to go a
little deeper this time. We're going to look
at Simpson's paradox, where the correlation between
two variables reverses, depending on whether
or not you control for a third variable that's
correlated with both of them. At the end of this lesson, you should be able to
understand the idea of conditioning on
a third variable, you should be able to
explain Simpson's paradox, and you should be able
to recognize that correlated third variables
are not always confounders. Sometimes you should resolve Simpson's paradox by conditioning
on the third variable, and sometimes you shouldn't. You should also, at the
end of this lesson, understand the vocabulary of confounders, mediators,
and colliders. We're going to see
three examples, all taken from your
required readings, and all three involve relationships among
three variables, which I'll call X1, X2, and Y, in keeping with the naming system from
one of the readings. First, let's look at the idea
of what it means to analyze the correlation between X1
and X2 conditioning on Y. We're trying to see if X1 causes X2 or how well
they're correlated, and conditioning on Y. Conditioning on a third variable, let's do this in the
context of an example. Here's the first example
from one of our readings. They enrolled a whole bunch of women in a longitudinal study. At the beginning, they
had a survey and they asked them a whole
lot of questions including: "Do you smoke?" Our variable, X1, is
whether they smoke at the time that this
study started, at time t1. Then 20 years later, they checked in and
see who's still alive. Our variable X2 is, are you alive at time
t1 plus 20, time t2. We have a third variable, Y, which is how old they
were at time t1. Now, suppose we're
trying to understand the relationship between
smoking and 20-year survival. If we want to, they're a
couple ways we could condition our analysis on the age
of the participants. The simplest is just to do a separate analysis
for each age group. That's conceptually
what they've done here, although statistically, they did something a little
more sophisticated. But if we look at just the 18-24-year-old at the
beginning of the study, we have this odds ratio; the smokers are 2.3 times more likely to die than
the nonsmokers. If we look at the 35-44-year-olds they're 2.4 times more likely. The smokers are in the 55-64
year age group is 1.61. These are the odds ratios, the difference in likelihood of not living for
another 20 years. Another possibility
is to include age as an independent variable
in a regression model. There are some other
possibilities like propensity score
matching that you might learn about in the course
of inference course. All of these are somehow
trying to account for age so that when you assess
whether smoking is dangerous, you're comparing like people, not comparing
30-year-old nonsmokers to 80-year-old smokers. They're all ways of conditioning the analysis on a third variable. Now, you don't have to adjust
for the third variable. There are third variables you might not even have data for, like eye color or
whether they own a car. If you do have the data, it's not always a good idea to condition your analysis on it. As we'll see, it would be a good idea to do
that conditioning in the case of the smoking study. Here's why you really need to do the conditioning on age
in this smoking study. What would the correlation
between smoking and mortality be in this study if we
did not condition on age? This is called Simpson's paradox. Here's the overall
set of smokers. Among the 582 smokers, we have 139 didn't make
it for the 20 years. Among the 732, 230 didn't. That's actually 24 percent
of the smokers died, and 31 percent of
the non-smokers did. If you just looked
at the overall, not conditioning for age, we get a complete reversal. It looks like smoking
actually protects you, makes you more likely
to live longer. What's really going on here? How could it be that for every age group or
almost every age group, you're more likely to live
longer if you don't smoke, but somehow overall, you're more likely to live longer
if you do smoke. How do you get that
kind of reversal? The answer is that
the fraction of smokers was much lower
in the older age groups. Let's look at table 2 again. Most of the older
participants are non-smokers at the
beginning of the study. Only 36 smokers and
129 non-smokers. Now let's look at a
different age group, say the 35-44 year-olds. Here, it's about even the number of smokers and non-smokers. Now we can speculate on
the reasons for this, possibly including
the smokers not living long enough
to participate, or just among the
elderly population is smokers don't want to
participate in the study. For whatever reason, we
do have that difference. How does that explain
the reversal? Well, people who are older are much less likely
to live 20 more years, whether they're smokers or not. If you're already 75, you have less chance of living 20 more
years than if you're 35. But since the non-smokers are
disproportionately older, overall, the nonsmokers
have less longevity. In this case, the third variable, age at the beginning of
the study is a confounder. People in the study who are older are less likely to smoke, people who are older
are also less likely to live 20 more years. You can see that in these
arrows that we've drawn here. People who are older in the study are less
likely to be smokers. We can speculate about what the reason is for
that relationship, whether it's a selection
effect they don't choose to participate or the people who smoked at younger
ages don't live to be in their 60s and 70s as much. But either way, we
have that imbalance that's in the age groups, and we also have
that people who are older tend not to live as long. But because we have this confounder that
affects both X1 and X2. If we want to understand the
relationship between X2, between smoking and longevity, we need to condition
our analysis on age. By the way, there may
be other confounders that we haven't examined. We can't conclude with
certainty based on this study that smoking is
dangerous for your health. But it's a much more reasonable
interpretation given just this data that it's dangerous rather than it
helps you live longer. What you'd get from doing
the overall analysis, not conditioning on age. Let's look at another example. From 1974-1978, in
that period in the US, there was a change
in the tax law. In fact, they reduced the marginal tax rate in
each of the tax brackets. I'll explain that
more in a second. What was the net effect
for US taxpayers? The way taxes work
in the US is that your income up to
the first level, say at that time $5,000
was taxed at one rate. In 1974, it was taxed
at 5.4 percent and it was reduced by
1978 to 3.5 percent. If your income or
all of your income above that first threshold
and up to the second, in this case, from $5,000-10,000 was taxed at a higher rate, a 9.3 percent in 1974, down also reduced to
7.2 percent in 1978, and so on for the
other tax brackets. The tax rate was reduced for
every single tax bracket. Politicians who had passed these tax reductions campaign
for re-election saying, "Hey, I lowered your taxes." But lots of voters
maybe almost all said, "Wait a minute, my effective
tax rate went up, not down." This is actually another
example of Simpson's paradox. X1 is time passing, X2 is the effective tax rate, the percentage of your
income that you pay, and the third variable Y in this case turns out
to be a person's income. If your income is higher, your highest tax
bracket will be higher, so your effective
tax rate will go up. It turns out 1974-1978 was
a period of high inflation. Prices and wages accordingly went up by about a
third during this time. Even if your buying
power didn't go up, your nominal income
went up by a third, and lots of people ended up with a higher maximum tax bracket and a higher overall
tax rate as a result. If we condition on
your 1978 income, and thus your tax bracket, in 1978, the tax rate went down for every
single tax payer. If we're trying to understand, what is this effect, 1974 to 1978 did your tax
rate go up or did it go down, and we condition on what your income level and thus your tax bracket is In 1978, the politician can claim correctly that everybody's
tax rate went down, conditioned on their income. But the effective tax rate actually went up
for lots of people. In fact, the overall
effective tax rate went up from 14.1 percent
to 15.2 percent. Here's the table
with the tax rates went from 5.4 percent
to 3.5 percent. In the lowest tax bracket, if you made a $100,000 or more, you'll only get a tiny
reduction in your tax rate. But the overall tax rate went up because between 1974 and 1978, a lot more people
had move it up to a higher tax bracket just
because of inflation. In this case, income expressed in nominal dollars rather than inflation adjusted dollars is
what's called the mediator. Actually this, we should show the arrow is going from X1 to Y. Time passing caused an
increase in nominal income, higher nominal income
caused an increase in the tax bracket and thus
in the effective tax rate. That was counteracting the
change in the tax law. Conditioning our analysis on the mediator Y is
a bad idea here. We needed to condition
on age to better understand the effect of
smoking on longevity. But here, conditioning
our tax bracket would mislead us about whether effective tax rates have
gone up from 1974 to 1978. Finally, let's look at an
example of a collider. This one is made up data from a simulated example
created by Julia Rohrer, which you'll read about
in her blog post. But it's made up from
a plausible model. Here we're interested in
the relationship between two personal attributes,
IQ test score, and there are
arguments about what the IQ test is
actually measuring, so I'll try to be
careful and refer to it as IQ rather than Intelligence, and a second variable
consciousness. Think of it as working hard, doing all the required
homework and so on. Now, if we look only at the
students attending college, we see a negative correlation. Higher IQ is associated
with less consciousness. In this simulated data there's
actually no correlation between IQ and consciousness
in the overall population. Here, the pink are
the college students, but the blue are those
who don't go to college. By the way, this blog post has a lot of humorous bits in it. Here the college students
are referred to as weirdos. Remember, WEIRD is this
acronym that's been coined to call
attention to the fact that a lot of
psychological research as US college students who are not like the
rest of the world, WEIRD is Western Educated, Industrialized, Rich,
and Democratic. If we include the non-weirdos, non-college students, you can see that
there's no correlation. But, there's a negative
correlation in the pink dots. There's actually a little
negative correlation and the blue dots too. How can that be? Remember
this is made up data. She constructed it so
there's no real correlation. This is another example
of Simpson's paradox. Why? Well, our third variable
here is going to college, and we're looking
at the relationship between consciousness and IQ. I think I misspelled consciousness
but you got the idea. We we're wondering about
this relationship, and it turns out that
if you have higher IQ, you're more likely
to go to college, and if you are more
consciousness and study hard, you're likely to go to college. This is called a collider. Both of our variables
cause this third variable. If you take a random college
student who's low IQ, if they still managed
to go to college, they probably are very
highly conscientious because that is the other route
to getting to college. If they're low in
conscientiousness, they better be high IQ or
they wouldn't get to college. If you take somebody
who has high IQ, they could be anywhere on conscientiousness but
if they're low IQ, that are going to be high
in conscientiousness. This is called the collider. If we want to understand the real relationship
between X1 and X2, between conscientiousness and IQ, we should not condition
on the collider. If you look only at
the college students, you'll get a misleading
result suggesting that conscientiousness is
negatively correlated with IQ in the overall
population, but it isn't. It's only negatively correlated, if we restrict ourselves to looking at the college students. This may seem like a
contrived example but it's basics structure may apply to some important current
policy debates. For example, in higher education, there's a movement to stop using the GRE score in graduate
school admissions. At UMSI, we stopped using
it for Master's degree admissions a couple
years ago and are dropping it from
our PhD admissions. There are a lot of good
arguments pro and con about whether to use the
GRE score in admission. One argument that
I think isn't so good is based on a couple
of published studies with empirical evidence showing a
lack of correlation between GRE score and various student
performance measures like program completion. From that, they infer
the GRE score is not informative about how applicants will do in graduate schools. But those empirical
studies condition on acceptance into
graduate programs, which is a collider variable. Now, presumably students
are admitted either, if they have high GRE scores or if their are other indicators
are positive or both. Thus, if we condition on
acceptance into the program, we should expect a negative
correlation between GRE scores and other
indicators of competence. Just like the
negative correlation between conscientiousness
and IQ scores in the simulated data or at
least we should expect to see a reduced correlation compared to what we would see
in the general public, including those who were not
admitted to the program. Lack of correlation
between GRE score and performance among
admitted students, doesn't mean that GRE score is uninformative about the likely
performance of applicants, including those who
weren't admitted. In summary, Simpson's paradox
or Simpson's reversal, occurs when you get different results about
the correlation of X1 and X2 depending on
whether you condition on the third variable Y. By conditioning, we mean either restricting our attention
to only one value of Y, like examining the
relationship only for college students or reporting
results separately for each value of Y like
each tax bracket or each age group or statistically controlling for
Y in a regression analysis. If the third variable
is a confounder, one that influences
both X1 and X2, then it's a good idea
to condition on it. If the third variable is
a mediator or a collider, it's a bad idea to
condition on it. Now, the bad news is
that it's sometimes not obvious whether the third
variable is a confounder, a mediator or a collider. At this point in the program, I'm not expecting you to
be an expert at that. I just want you to
have an awareness that the right way to deal
with third variables, whether you should condition
on them or not is, there's not a single
answer for it. A few maxims and questions to summarize what we've
been talking about. First, is this a case
of Simpson's paradox? Don't assume is a confounder, it might be a mediator or a collider or perhaps
an ethical commitment. I will never knowingly report an analysis that conditions
on a collider or a mediator. Let me close with a couple of jokes about aging
since we've been dealing with the morbid topic
of smoking and longevity. Comedian George Burns said, that if you live to be 100, you've got it made. Very few people
die past that age. He actually lived to be 100, so I guess that
tells you something. More generally, did you know
that it's been proven in several empirical studies that celebrating birthdays is
good for your health? Yeah. Statistics show that those people who celebrate
the most birthdays live the longest. I'll
see you next time.
