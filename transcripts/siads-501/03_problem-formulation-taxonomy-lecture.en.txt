Welcome back. Today's lesson provides a taxonomy for
different types of data science problems. At the end of this week,
you should know the taxonomy. You should be able to recognize
the different types of problems that articulate why some problem belongs
in one category or another. And you should cultivate curiosity about
problem formulations, asking yourself, what's the real problem? And finally, you should recognize
the dangers of proxies for the outcomes that you really care
about because proxies will be gained. Our first problem type is classification
or probability estimation. You have a sequence of items. And for each one,
you want to assign a discrete label to it. Here, the items are emails and you want
to assign the label, okay or spam. We could also have more than two labels, then it would be called a multi-class
classification problem. Also instead of just
giving a discrete answer, you might also assign probabilities
to the different classes. Now, when you're talking to a stakeholder,
a client, how can you recognize that the problem they're asking you to
work on is a classification problem? Well, you might ask yourself, are they
dividing a set of items into groups and are the groups predefined in advance? Also, you might listen for phrases
like predict what kind of thing it is. If that's a phrase you're hearing in
coming out of your own mouth or or that of your client,
you probably have a classification or some kind of prediction problem. So another kind of prediction
problem is regression. With regression, you're trying
to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or
more features are independent variables. The simplest form of regression problem
is predicting y as a function of X. Here, we have a linear regression
line in red predicting a value for any given x value. But that's a particular kind of model for
doing the prediction. What makes it a regression problem is that
there's a single outcome, a dependent variable and there's one or more other
features the independent variables. A third type of problem
is similarity matching. In a similarity matching problem, we again
have items with a bunch of features. But instead of predicting one feature
from the others, as we do in a regression problem, our task is to decide
the similarity of any pair of items. For example,
suppose we want to do roommate matching. We have some attributes,
do people like to stay up late or they clean or they quiet or noisy and two people will be more similar if they
match on a lot of these attributes. You might have, you might care
more about some attributes and others you create some
kind of distance metric. How can you recognize when you have
a similarity matching problem? Well, you've got a bunch of items or
people and given an item, you want to be
able to find other similar items. You might hear phrases like,
nearest neighbors or distance metric or any pair of items or good matches. Those would be all be
indicators that maybe you've got a similarity matching problem. Another problem type is clustering. So a clustering problem is when you
want to divide things into groups. But you may not know in
advance what the groups are. So for clustering the groups
aren't predefined and they may not have names whereas for
classification you have predefined groups. Now, a clustering problem might
build on similarity matching. We you try to group things that are all
close to each other in this example, we use spatial distance and assign one
of three colors, yellow, red or blue. Notice that the the one item in
the center, this yellow one, is a little bit hard to
assign to a cluster. It's sort of close to
the bottom red group. It's also sort of close
to the left yellow group. In this case,
we decided to group it with the yellow. If we had made for
clusters instead of three, we might have ended up making
a group of maybe just these things. How do you recognize when you
have a clustering problem? When you're dividing things into groups
that aren't predefined, your often doing it for exploratory analysis trying to
understand what kinds of things you have. And this will be,
this will work especially well, if you're able to come up with good
descriptive names for the categories or groups that you come up with. You might recognize that you're dealing
with a clustering problem if you hear phrases like, divide them into groups or
figure out what kinds of things we have. Or the word clustering or the word communities if it's
people that are being grouped. Another problem type is
co-occurrence grouping. Goes by a number of different names,
frequent item, set mining, associated rule discovery, market basket analysis,
item to item collaborative filtering. It's a particular kind of clustering
where when you group items based on co-occurrence of some behavior
with respect to the items. Items that people buy together, people who
read one book also read this other book, items that are both liked on Facebook. For example, on Amazon, people who
bought this item also bought this item, this other item. Actually a little historical note,
the first version of Amazon's item recommender came out of my own
group lens research project, which we we first published about in 1994. Some of my collaborators on that project
started a company called Net Perceptions. And Amazon bought their
the recommender product to use for their for
their first recommender system on it on Amazon before they ended up
building their own internal engine. So, how can you recognize
this problem type? Well, you're trying to find related items. You might hear phrases like,
what else did they buy, people who like this also tended
to like and other similar phrases. Another problem type is profiling. We've taken this whole taxonomy
from chapter in the book that we've assigned to you for reading. For this category profiling,
they really snuck in two problem types. So one is profiling. Can you give a description that
summarizes a group of items or the relationship between variables? So something like, people with credit cards generally
spend 400 to a $1,000 per week. Or our audience for coverage of the
Wimbledon tennis tournament second round is usually about 300,000 viewers at 8am. Now this is sometimes useful. This kind of profiling is useful for
creating personas or archetypes for thinking about who your typical customer
is or what a typical behavior is. You can use it as a mental model for
designers. You can also use it as a mental model for
detecting anomalous outcomes. The second type of problem
that they've included here, which is really anomaly detection. The blue triangle here is anomalous. It doesn't fit the general pattern and
when you have something like this for those of you who remember Sesame Street. It's you know, one of these
things is not like the others, one of these things just doesn't belong. When you see something that's anomalous,
it deserves more investigation. Maybe we should have our fraud detection
department call this person and check whether all of those credit
card charges are really theirs. So how can you recognize these two problem
types of profiling and anomaly detection? Well with profiling, somebody would
be asking what's a typical person or a typical item or a typical behavior? And for anomaly detection, they'd be
saying one of these things is not like the other,
one of these things just doesn't belong. Or what's unusual or
suspicious or surprising. That would be anomaly detection. Our next problem type is link prediction. Which things that are not linked yet
probably will be linked in the future? For example, is person C likely to become friends with person B in
the next time period or is webpage C likely to add
a link to page B sometime soon? You can recognize that you're being asked
to work on a link prediction problem when you hear phrases like,
predict what connections will be made. What will they read next? What new groups will they join? Who will they talk to next? What new friendships will form? A data reduction problem is
where you have many features and you'd like to reduce them to just a few. One technique is called
principal components analysis. This figure illustrates taking
three dimensional data and reducing it to two components. Or typically, you'd have many
more than three dimensions and you might have more than two
components that you're reducing it to. You can recognize this kind
of problem if somebody says, hey can we roll up some of these things
into a single composite feature or are some of these features redundant? Can we combine them? Or can we can we project all these
things into a two-dimensional map so that we can visualize the whole space? Those would be indicators of
a dimension reduction problem. In a causal modeling problem,
you try to see whether A causes B. If we change the value of A,
would it lead to a change in B? For example, does smoking
cigarettes lead to premature death? And we often represent a causal
model in terms of a block and arrow diagram like you see on this slide. A big question in causal analysis is
whether to condition your analysis on third variables and that's something
we'll be looking at in a future week for this causal diagram. How can you recognize when you're dealing
with a causal inference problem or causal modeling problem? Well, somebody might say does X cos y or
does X lead to y or they may ask counter factual questions,
if we change or improve or reduce X,
will that improve or solve Y? Those are causal modeling problems. The Gardener Group provides a different
breakdown of problem types and their model organization's progress
from easier problem types to harder ones with prescriptive analytics what I call,
causal analysis coming later. So they begin with descriptive
things like clustering. Going on to diagnostic things
like classification and regression looks at past data. To predictive analytics,
which looks at classification and regression where you're
predicting future outcomes. And finally, too prescriptive or
causal modeling. Now, I have a maxim that most prediction
problems are really causal modeling problems in disguise. That is, you might think you're trying
to predict things but you really want to know if you change something, can you
change what will happen in the future. Not always true but it is worth asking
yourself when you're facing a prediction problem what the client wants
to use the predictions for. Do they really want to use it
to do counterfactual is of if I change something, can I predict
what will happen when I change that? The reading bike I do suggest
a different breakdown based on two axis taking the same four types of
problems from the Gardener analysis. And just breaking it into two axis
of whether you're doing data versus intelligence, descriptive and
predictive things versus higher level intelligence diagnostic and
predictive things. And on the second axis, hindsight
versus foresight, past versus future. As in many of these two by two boxes, you'll see the best thing
in the upper right. So the ultimate goal being is
prescriptive or causal modeling. So those are some alternative
problem formulation taxonomies. I'll see you next time for the impact of
problem formulation and in particular, the danger of proxy outcomes for
the outcome that you really care about.
