Here are a few maxims, questions, and ethical commitments
that summarize my perspective on
the problem formulation stage. First, outcome proxies
will be gained. Second, the original formulation is rarely the right formulation, and there's a nice cartoon
that illustrates this. Perhaps you've seen
a variant of this before. But as the customer explained it, they want a swaying
with three boards, the project manager understood something a little different, the analyst killed the tree, the programmer wrote something where the swing is
not off the ground, the business consultant
presented an easy chair, there was no documentation. What the customer
really needed which is not exactly what the customer
asked for was a tire swing. Another maximum and this comes from the consulting
industry is the Five Whys. One way to mitigate
the problem of what the customer says
is not exactly what they want is to keep asking why, why is the analysis
needed even though the question seems to have
been answered already? This Five Whys approach was
originally developed for root cause analysis by Sakichi Toyoda for
the Toyota Motor Company, but some consulting
companies use it for asking why the job is being done. So what does the question
to be answered, why do you care
about that answer, and then just keep
going, why is that, why is that, why is that, and eventually you get to some pretty interesting
answers that are not where you started. Another maxim is that most prediction problems are really causal reasoning
problems in disguise. You'll see example
of this when we give you a sample answer to one of your assignments
for this week. The problem domain here is
social services and they want an early warning system for predicting jail
time and ER visits. That's a prediction problem, can you predict given
this person are they going to go to jail in the next year or are they going to have
multiple ER visits? But I think it's probably a disguised
causal modeling question. The social service agency that pose this question is
actually thinking about, who should we send out
our social workers to see on the theory that if we send
those social workers to them, we can reduce the risk that they will end up in jail
over the next year. Now, why is it important to
realize that maybe there was an unstated causal
reasoning question here? The answer is that
some people who are at high risk may not benefit from
the social worker visits. There may be other people at somewhat lower risk who
might benefit more. That's the social service agency
should really care more about the causal
modeling question of, who can we have
the most beneficial impact by going to visit, rather than the prediction
question of who is at risk. So another good question
to always ask, who will be using the results
and for what decisions? So here's another example from the samples that
we're going to give you for the assignment
for this week. Suppose our domain is journalism and when there's
a breaking news story, the problem formulation is, how often do our
readers check back for updates and at what times of day? So if you were to
ask the question, who will be using the results
and for what decisions? There's several possible
decision-makers and decisions, maybe the newsroom
would use it to decide how often to
send an update on a story or advertisers might care about whether now's
a good time to advertise. Why is it helpful to
ask this question? Well, knowing who's going to use the results and how
they're expecting to use it might affect the data and the
analysis that you do. For example, suppose the results will be used by the newsroom to inform their decision on how often do they send an update
on a breaking story. In that case we'll
need to include peak traffic times for readers who click on
the breaking news stories. On the other hand, suppose the advertisers are
going to use our insights to decide if it's a good day
or time to advertise, perhaps they have an idea
about the effects of seeing the advertisement multiple times in a short period of time, then the analysis would
be sure to include what percentage of people
check back more than k times. Another good question
to ask all the time, who are the stakeholders? For example, from an interview with Aaron Schulman
that you'll be reading, she's a data scientist
at Nordstrom and they had an idea to alert Nordstrom stylists
when a customer needed a refill on one of
the beauty products, so that the stylist
would call the customer and get the customer to buy the refill
before they run out. It seems like a reasonable idea, but the stakeholder
here was the stylist. So they thought they should go check with the stylist
which turned out to be a very good idea because
they found out that the stylist would not benefit from making a call to their customers because if they make a call to the customer, then the customer goes and
refills the product online, the stylist doesn't
get any commission, the stylists were only
getting commissions in store. So eventually they decided to change their tool and
actually change who the stakeholder would be
directly sending email to the customers rather than giving a prompt to the stylist. Of course you can imagine
other possible outcomes from that stakeholder analysis, like changing
the commission structure so that the stylist did get commissions when they
called up their customers and they bought something
outside of the store. Those are some good questions
to ask all the time. Here's an example of a couple
of ethical commitments. In this problem
formulation stage, a data scientist should not over-hype what they're
going to be able to produce. Second, they should
speak truth to power, that is somebody, the client
is more powerful, they're going to ask you
to do something and you have to make sure
that you don't just give them what they want, but give them the truth,
what they need to hear. Which reminds me of a joke or a story that my friend John Thomas
documented on his blog. He tells a story
about many years ago being brought into
a project that was supposed to help
foster trust between the upper management and the lower management at a large telecom company
that he was working for. The upper management wanted to imitate practices
that they sought another company
whose lower management held a lot of trust in
the upper management, not so much a John's company. So at the other company, what they were doing was
that the lower management, everybody would get together and the lower management would give a one-minute talk about
problems they were facing. They'd say it out loud to all the other managers
meeting both lower and upper management and they'd get feedback, they'd share ideas. So they wanted to import that practice into
John's company, but at John's company they were bigger and they had
a lot more lower management. So the upper managers decided
they would do a variation. They changed
the meeting structure, so instead of the lower managers giving one-minute stories, the upper management would
give an hour-long lecture, say about job responsibilities. Then at the end,
the lower managers would respond to a question, for example, how well do you know your job responsibilities? So they would respond
to a question by pressing one of the digits
on their phone, telecom company,
enter zero to nine. John, he was a human
factor specialist and they brought him
in to help determine should zero be on the top of the scale or should
nine be on the top of the scale for people
giving their feedback? Now, John thought
that the whole idea of the senior managers giving
a lecture for an hour to the junior managers who then
were going to give a zero to nine feedback was a terrible idea that was not going to create
trust in the company. So of course, he told the person that came and gave him this task, it was an aid to the CEO as John tells it "The
aids base grew red." He got a pugnacious look on the front of his head and said, "Well, when my boss, who by the way is the CEO, asked me what the best way
to do something is, it's my job to tell him the best way not to
tell him that it's a bad idea," to which I responded, "Well, when my boss
asked me which type of chainsaw is best for him
to use to trim his hair, it's my responsibility
to tell him that a chainsaw is a really bad way
to cut his hair." Don't let your boss
use a chainsaw to get a haircut. I'll
see you next time.
