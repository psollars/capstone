Hi. My name is Bobby Madamanchi, and I'm a lecturer at the
School of Information here at the University
of Michigan. In addition to this course, I teach Intermediate
Python on campus, and in the MADS program, I teach in several of the
data visualization courses. I want to welcome
you to MADS 501, which I'll be
teaching along with my colleague, Dr.
Melissa Chalmers. I'm excited that this term we'll be joined by a
small handful of GSIs, who are all currently
MAD students and have recently
taken this course. There'll be able to
provide a little bit of a near peer perspective that hopefully will help
you as you learn to make your way through
the MADS program. A little bit about
my background, I have a PhD in cancer biology from Vanderbilt University, where I use data science
approaches to make a tiny contribution to our
knowledge about cancer. After this, I did a postdoc in computational
biology at Purdue, followed by two years as a scholar in the future
of work and learning. During my time at
Purdue, I got really interested in
understanding how to help adults who have
deep knowledge in a particular discipline learn to apply computational
and data approaches. I did some research
in that area, and last year I was
lucky enough to join Michigan as a lecturer, where I get to contribute to this program and enact
what I was studying. MAD students are my favorite
students to work with. Because they're taking on this challenge of
learning this material, and learning how to incorporate it and integrate it with their
existing domain knowledge. My best piece of advice
for MAD students, is to join the
Slack and to get to know a few of your
fellow classmates. The informal learning and information sharing
that you do with your classmates is
almost as important or, maybe as important as the technical knowledge we
impart during these courses. It is centered on helping you
figure out how to navigate the program and navigate
your careers, afterwards. I look forward to
working with you in this and other courses.
