Welcome back. As you're
thinking about how to have the greatest impact with results of your data analysis, it's helpful to step back
and think about how you'll be interacting with the rest of the organization
that you're part of. At the end of today's lecture, you should be able
to identify some of the complimentary roles of other people the data
scientists work with and you should be
able to articulate the advantages and
disadvantages of centralizing the data science team in
an organization versus dispersing it out and embedding the data scientists
with other teams. Who do data scientists
interact with? First, clients and
maybe product managers or people in marketing
or executives. You'll also deal with
operations people. You may need to get data from internal systems and you may even want them to change
what data is collected. The operations folks will
be gatekeepers for this. These are the people
who design and maintain databases and servers and
processing pipelines. They know that they
are service providers providing infrastructure. They generally start
their career with a service mentality just
like data scientists. They want to do things that help other people in the company succeed at what
they're trying to do. But theirs is often
a thankless job. They're on call when
things break down and they only get noticed when
something goes wrong. This is a general feature
of infrastructure, you only notice it
when it breaks down. If you're one of those operations people that can wear on you. Sometimes the being of service mentality
gets buried under a, "I'm not going to take any risks that could lead to headaches because those headaches
will all be my headaches." Respect and gratitude can go a long way in working with
the operations folks. Another thing that
can help is to engage them in creative problem-solving. Instead of just asking them
to implement the solution that you've come up
with for your problem, share your problem
and invite them to think about possible
solutions with you. They may be less
interested in having you try to solve their problems. When they raise an issue
saying that what you want to do will create
operational problems, they may not think that you have the expertise and they
don't trust you to have their interests at heart because you aren't the
one who's going to get yelled at or have to come in at 2:00 AM to fix a problem. If you try to
question exactly what operational problems
that's going to cause, they may dig in their heels. Instead, if you get them to
think about how to solve your problem without creating an operational problem for them, they're likely to
figure out a way. They tend to be
problem-solving types. Another role that you might interact with are the
developers and engineers. We talked last time in a previous lecture about
machine learning engineers who might turn your
one-time analysis into a product that runs
frequently or continuously. Another role that you might
interact with are people in public policy or communications
or public relations. Your results, they could have implications for
the company's image. You can't violate laws or company policies around
privacy or data handling. They're going to be gatekeepers
and it may tempt you to view them as bureaucrats who are just
there to get in your way. Many of them are
lawyers and everyone, including me, sometimes likes
to tell anti-lawyer jokes. But you should recognize that they have an important role. Unlike with the
operations people, where my advice was, get them involved in trying
to solve your problems, my suggestion here is to help try to solve their problems. Ask more about what
their concerns are, rephrase them back to them, brainstorm with them about
alternatives that might have a positive impact on public relations or otherwise
advance their goals. Overall, your challenge
is going to be to understand well
enough what all of these other functions are so
that you can work well with them without losing
your own identity as a data scientist. Our second topic today
is centralization versus embedding of data
scientists in the organization. If you're in a very
small organization, you'll probably play
more than one role, not just data scientist. But in larger organizations, things get more specialized. Once there a bunch of data scientists in
the organization, there's a question, how
do we organize them? All the data scientists can sit together and report to
a data science manager, that's the centralized approach, or they can be distributed, dispersed into product teams, and report to managers who may not know much about data science, that's the embedded approach. Or you can have some hybrid. One advantage of the
centralized approach is that the data scientists have more opportunities
to learn and stay current on data
science practices. They also have a chance to
learn and share processes for interacting with the other
units in the organization. The centralized Data Science unit can create consistent
metrics and practices. It's also pretty
helpful for recruiting. Because often the data scientists that you're
trying to recruit, it's going to have a better
time coming in for a set of interviews with six
data scientists than a set of
interviews with people who don't speak their language. The other hand, there are
some big advantages to embedding the Data Scientist in the rest of the organization. They will learn more
about the business needs of the clients and they'll be better able to serve
those clients. They'll also have sort of the right regime
of accountability. They'll have accountability
for having an impact rather than accountability
for making cool models. Now there are lots
of organizations that are seeing the advantages of both centralization and embedding in trying to create hybrids. In one of your readings
for this lecture. There's a description
of this hybrid version at Airbnb where the centralized part is that the data scientist career unfolds in a centralized
organization, their pay raises
are decided there. But specific sub teams of the Data Science
organization will partner more directly
with other units. There's lots of variations of this in different organizations. There's really no perfect
answer for all time. You can't be in two
places at once, both with the Data Scientists
and with the clients. You can't be fully accountable to two parts of the
organization at once. Early in your career, unless you're working
for a startup, you aren't going to get to
decide how Data Science has organized within your
company or organization. Your influence on what structure you're going to be
in is really going to come through selection. That is, you can try to get a job in an organization where Data Science is more centralized or one where it's more embedded. Either way, you're going to
have to take initiative to compensate for the
deficiencies of who you're not sitting next
to or interacting with. If Data Science is centralized, then you're going to have to be proactive to take advantage of the informal
opportunities to build your network in the organization outside the Data Science team. When you work with a client
or an operations person, make a point of going out to
lunch with them and asking about their job beyond the particular things
you're working on. The other hand, if Data Sciences are embedded in the
organization you worked for, you're going to have
to be proactive about keeping up with developments
in Data Science. Form a community of practice
with other data scientists, either within the
company or beyond by following blogs and podcasts or maybe creating
one for yourself. Acquire the latest tools
and play around with them. Because you don't
want to end up in an organization for five years and suddenly discover
that you're way behind where the Data
Science field is gone. You'll be less valuable to
the company and you'll have less ability to move to
other interesting jobs. Maxims and commitments. First, understand what your internal partners
are accountable for. Help your internal partners
be successful at their jobs. Develop a reputation for
being a team player. A couple more to reflect your dual need for expertise
about the organization you work for and expertise
about Data Science. Know your business,
know your profession. Different perspectives. I ran into someone once who
claimed to be a superhero. So I asked her what
was her superpower? She said she had two, time and money. Say what? Yeah. She said she aged really slowly and had a life expectancy
of millions of years. I asked, "Wow. How do
you experience time?" "A thousand years for me feels like a second does to you." Okay, and money? I have a lot, a lot of money. For me a million dollars is
like a penny is for you. Really? Well, could you give
me a million dollars then? Sure. She said, "I'll give
it to you in a minute." That's all our time together. I hope you've enjoyed
this course. Bye.
