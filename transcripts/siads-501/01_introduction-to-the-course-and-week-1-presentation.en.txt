Hi I'm Paul Resnick. Welcome everyone to being
a data scientist on being. [inaudible] Welcome everybody. The ideas of
this course are first to reflect on what
data scientists do. Second, to make a plan for how to acquire the knowledge and
skills that you'll need. Drew Conway created the famous
Data Science diagram, depicting the broad set of
skills that are needed. Many other people have
introduced variants of it. You're definitely going to
need some programming skills, some modeling skills, and some domain expertise,
and some domain. But you'll also need skills in formulating the right problem, presenting results in a way that non-experts can understand them, and some other things as well. A third goal is to
start developing an identity as a data scientist. We want you to notice the things that data scientists notice, ask the kind of
questions that they ask, like, what will you use
this classifier for? We want you to start
spouting their maxims, like, beware of overfitting, and
correlation is not causation. Even adopt their ethical
commitments, like, don't commit to the answer before you do the Data Analysis, and follow the
information sources that other data
scientists follow. We'd even like you to start appreciating the same
humor that they do. I'll be telling
some statistics programming and generally geeky jokes. For example, there are
two kinds of data scientists. First, are those who can extrapolate from incomplete data. All right. So that's an overview of what this course is about. In this first week,
we're going to cover four stages of
a data science project. Problem formulation,
data collection and cleaning, Analysis and Modeling, and presenting results and
integrating them into action. The activities here are going
to be, a lecture video, and then reading
chapter from the book, Business Problems and
Data Science Solutions by Foster Provost
and Tom Fawcett. But then we'll focus on
problem formulation. There'll be lecture videos on the taxonomy from the chapter
that you already read, a taxonomy of problem types, and one on the dangers of using proxies for the outcomes that you really care about, and one that just summarizes
a bunch of maxims, and questions, and
ethical commitments. There's a required
reading on doing a personal project that you
can share with the world, and two optional readings. One on an alternative taxonomy
of problem types, and the other is Chapter 3 from Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil. I'll be talking some about that. When we talk about
the dangers of proxies, we'll look at school rankings. We've a third activity, which is Interviews
with Data Scientists. It's really helpful as you develop your own identity
as a data scientist to read about how some other Data Scientists work and how they think
about their work. There are three required
chapters from a book called, Data Scientists at Work, and then there's
some optional videos that I have recorded
with data scientists. There's a separate video that I've recorded for you that gives an overview of what the course assignments
will be in this course. The learning objectives
for this course are; at the end you should
be able to explain the four project stages
as a framework for data science problems
and solutions including the goals and
desired outcomes of each stage. You should be able to
describe the expertise, the perspectives and
the ethical commitments that Data Scientist may bring to
each of the four stages. You should be able to
articulate a set of maxims and questions that apply to each of the four stages and to data science
projects as a whole, and you should be
able to create and maintain an environmental
monitoring system for yourself, for how you'll stay up-to-date on new developments in Data Science. That's for the whole course. For just this week, at
the end of the week, you should be able to describe
a project stages using vocabulary that we use of
the four stages of a project. You should be able to recognize different types of problems, and articulate why each of those problems is the type
that you've named it, and you should have cultivated some curiosity about problem
formulations, in particular, develop the habit of asking
what's the real problem, and recognizing the dangers
that can come from proxies for the outcomes
that you really care about because
they'll get gamed. In closing, got a little
Data Science joke for you. So a company Manager
is lying across the desert in a hot air balloon, he realizes he's lost. He calls down to a man riding on a camel below and then
mean asks, "Where am I?" The man replies, "You are 42 degrees and 12 minutes
21.2 seconds north, 122 degrees ten minutes west, you're 212 meters above sea level and you are heading due
east by northeast." "Thanks" replies the balloonist. "By the way are you
a data scientist?" "Yes." Replies Man.
"How did you know?" "Well, everything you told
me was totally accurate, you gave me way more
information than I needed, and I still have no idea what the heck I'm
supposed to do." "Oh I'm sorry," replied
the camel riding data scientist. "By the way, are you
accompany Manager?" "Yeah, " answered the
balloonist. "How did you know? "Well," replied
the data scientists, "you've got no idea
where you are, no idea what direction
you're going, you got yourself into this fix by blowing a lot of hot air, and now you expect me
to get you out of it." Yeah. Don't be that kind of Data Scientists and hopefully, you won't get
that kind of Manager. I'll see you next time.
