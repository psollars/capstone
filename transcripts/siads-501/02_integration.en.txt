Welcome back. What happens if you want the
analysis process you did once to be automatically repeated
on an ongoing basis? In other words, put
it into production. At the end of today's lecture, you should be able to
appreciate what can go wrong in turning
your onetime analysis into a production process and understand what a Machine
Learning Engineer does, making code be efficient, scalable, stable, and reusable. So what can go wrong? Putting your analysis
into production? First, inefficiency. Your code may be inefficient
on larger datasets, it may fail to get answers
fast enough or you might put too much load on servers or databases slowing
down other processes. Second, brittleness. You did some manual
data cleaning. How will cleaning
happen automatically? There may be edge cases
that you didn't think of that cause the code to
break or to give bad results. Those edge cases maybe
just didn't come up in the data you
use for training and evaluation but it
might come up sometime in the future when the process
is being repeated. So all the diagnostics you
did to check for a bus and appropriateness of
your analysis need to be tuned in a repeated process. What will you do if any of those checks fail in the future? Well there'll be
alerts? Who's going to pay attention to them? So what does a Machine
Learning Engineer do? Basically, they use good software
engineering practices to resolve some of
those potential problems of scalability and brittleness. A Machine Learning engineer is going to have a lot of power to help your project get into
production or to kill it. By saying that it's
just not scalable, It'll take too much work. The reading we've assigned you is wisdom from the trenches of someone who happened into becoming a Machine
Learning Engineer. Its written from
the perspective of helping people evaluate whether they want to also become
Machine Learning Engineers. Now that's not why we're
having you read it. You don't have to
give up your data scientist's identity in order to become a Machine
Learning Engineer. We're having you read it
because it's good to know what a Machine Learning
Engineer does so that you'll be able to work
well with them and so that you're not surprised when you think it's going
to be easy to put your project into production
and they laugh at you. You're not going to just hand-off your Jupyter Notebook in the slide deck for your presentation that
you made to the CEO. You're not just going
to hand those off to the Machine Learning
Engineer to implement and never see the project again The Data Scientist is still going to have to
be involved in some things. For example, if
the model diagnostics that passed with current data
fail with some future Data, the Machine Learning Engineer
can't be expected to make a substantive decision about how that problems
should be handled. They're going to have
to consult with you. It's a good idea to make friends with the Machine
Learning Engineers, consult with them early as soon as it
becomes clear to you that you have
something that perhaps should eventually
go into production. By consulting with them early, you might be able to make some small adjustments that make things easier for the Machine
Learning Engineer later on. Respect them, learn to
speak their language, of scalability efficiency, robustness, and
coding guidelines. Things will go much
better for you if you do. So maxims, befriend
the Machine Learning engineers and be humble about how much you've done when
you think you're done. Because there's a lot more that they're going to have to do. So in summary,
having your analysis go into production
is a great success. Many of your project
won't go into production. So celebrate when they do. But a lot of things can go wrong with Scaling
and robustness. Try to be a good partner with a Machine Learning engineers
who are going to put your analysis process
into production. Today's closing joke
isn't really related to today's topic but I heard it recently and
it made me chuckle. So here goes. A guy
goes into the doctor. He's got a carrot in one ear some salary coming out of
the other ear and he's got a piece of cucumber up one nostril and a green pepper
up the other nostril. The doctor comes into the room and says,
"Hey, what's going on?" "Doc, I really don't feel well." "Well, that's because
you don't eat right." I'll see you next time.
