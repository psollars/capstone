Welcome back.
Today's lesson introduces a way to think about a
prototypical data science project in terms of four stages
beginning with problem formulation and finishing with presentation and deployment. At the end of this lesson, you should be able to describe a project stages
using our vocabulary. We'll talk about
four stages for a project. First, problem formulation, then data collection
and cleaning, third modeling and analysis, and finally presentation
and deployment or sometimes we'll call deployment putting it into production. Of course, it won't always
be linear like this, you may end up going back to an earlier stage for
example collecting additional data once
you realize how valuable it will be during
the analysis stage. These stages are
useful conceptual model for the activities
of a data scientist. We've organized the course
around them with one week for each
of the four stages. Now, here's a diagram that you're likely to come across at some point in
your professional life. It comes from a cross
industry working group. CRISP stands for the Cross Industry Standard Process
for Data Mining. It uses a slightly
different vocabulary and breakdown of
activities than ours, so I'm going to do a little
mapping to our vocabulary. What they call business
understanding, that's our problem formulation. They've broken down slightly different wording
data understanding and data preparation that's what we'll call our
data collection and cleaning. Then they have modeling and
evaluation of the model. We're going to call that the
modeling and analysis days. Finally, they have deployment. Now, not every data analysis
that you do will get deployed as a continuous
production process. So we're calling this
presentation and deployment. Somethings will be
presented one time and will affect some decisions
that not be turned into a production process where
you need a deployment. Now, how long will you really spend on each of these stages? Here's some results
from a big poll that as practicing and aspiring
data scientists. Now, they didn't in their poll ask about
all of our stages, they don't include
problem formulation. They've broken our second stage
into three parts, and then they've got model
building and model selection, that's our modeling
and analysis part. They've got the presentation and the putting it
into production. That's our last stage. Now, you can see there's some differences among
the different groups like the students think that they're going to
spend more time doing modeling and analysis and any of the practicing
data scientists think, but there's quite a bit
of agreement, and everybody is estimating somewhere around
half of their time is going to go into
the data collection and cleaning part. So be warned that will be
a big part of your job. There's actually
a running joke that in data science 80 percent of your time is spent
preparing data, and the other 20 percent
of your time is spent complaining about
the need to prepare data. So in summary, we've
got four stages for our data science project
problem formulation, data collection and cleaning, modeling and analysis,
presentation and deployment. There's an old joke about
IT projects from the 1970s which might still
hit a little too close to home for
today's data science projects. It turns out that there are
really six stages not four, the first one is enthusiasm, then comes disillusionment,
the third is panic, then the fourth stage is
search for the guilty, punishment of the innocent. Finally, praise and honor for the nonparticipants.
I'll see you next time.
