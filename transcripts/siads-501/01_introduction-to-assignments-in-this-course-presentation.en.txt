Welcome back everybody. This video will provide an overview
of what your assignments will be for the whole course. The specific directions will
be in the actual assignments. The big thing you'll be doing
is creating a document, a big document with your plan for
being a data scientist. You'll do that in parts, we'll ask you
to work on various parts of it and give you feedback. This document is going to
articulate your aspirations for what domain you want to work in, what
knowledge and skills that you're going to need, and how you're going to
acquire the knowledge and skills. You'll submit drafts of components of this
document during the first three weeks of the course and receive feedback and provisional grades from the instructional
team on those components. Then in the last week, you'll assemble
possibly revised versions of all those components plus a few more into your final
document and you'll receive a final grade. We hope that this plan will end up being
a living document that you return to and update through the rest of
your time in the program. It may even serve as a personal manifesto
that you'll choose to share with colleagues, employers, or employees. I'll sometimes refer to it
simply as your manifesto. In the first week, you'll specify a domain
of interest that you hope to work in or already do work in as a data scientist. A domain could be something like
health care or education, finance, sports management, retail,
local government, or national security. You will submit to hypothetical problems
that you imagine someone could work on as a data scientist within your
chosen domain of interest. First, state the problem, then classify it
using the taxonomy of problem types that we've built up,
clustering classification, etc. Make sure you provide a mapping
between the domain constructs and the problem constructs. For example,
if you say it's a clustering problem, what are the things that will
be clustered into groups? Each week, this course will focus on one
of the four stages of a data science project, four stages, four weeks. Each week, you'll submit some content
related to that week's stage, so that will include a plan for how you will acquire
the knowledge and skills that a data scientist needs to function effectively
during that stage of a project. And then some maxims, questions, and ethical commitments
relevant to that stage. So by knowledge acquisition, I mean that we're going to provide you
an inventory of things that we think a data scientist should have
that are relevant to each stage. Then for each of those items,
we're going to ask you to reflect, do you already have this capability? And if so, tell us how you acquired it. Or maybe you don't have it yet, you look
forward to strengthening that capability. And if so, you'll say how. And in many cases, it's going to be because you'll learn it
in one of the courses in this program. We'd like you to make your best guess
about where in the curriculum you think various things will be covered. It's a way of sort of getting you to
engage and maybe we'll tease out some misconceptions you might have about
what's coming in the curriculum and we'll be able to provide
you feedback with that. If it turns out there's something else
that you think should be added to our inventory of skills and
knowledge that's not already listed, you'll always be able to add that. You've probably already noticed me
referring to the idea of generic questions, maxims, and
ethical commitments. For example, I summarized my takeaways from
the repertoire of problem types that way. I think it's really helpful for professionals to develop a set of
guideposts for themselves, reminders of things that are important to think about
which they might otherwise forget. So I'd like to try to distill insights
into generic questions, maxims, and commitments that can potentially
guide me on any project. And I encourage you to do that as well. Well, it's really more
than just encouragement, it's an essential requirement of all
of your assignments for this course. In past iterations of this course,
I found that some students are initially confused about what
a maximum commitment is. So here's a little explanation. A maxim is a short, pithy statement
expressing a general truth or rule of conduct. For example, here are some maxims that
are popular in the United States. An ounce of prevention is worth
a pound of cure, or the golden rule, do unto others as you would
have them do unto you. Don't cry wolf,
you can't judge a book by its cover. These are generic statements. If you think of the book and
its cover metaphorically, you can apply the statement to lots of situations,
you just have to do the mapping. For example, perhaps on a dating site,
the book is the person and the cover is the profile image. Or when choosing a graduate program,
the book is the degree program and the cover is the shiny brochure we sent
you promising you that all the homework when there is any would be super easy and you'd earn $1 million dollars
a year after you graduate. In this course, we'll be looking for
slightly less generic maxims. They should be especially relevant
to data science projects. They don't have to be very useful in
deciding how to act on a dating site or how to choose a graduate program, but we still want them to be generic
across data science projects. We want something like correlation doesn't
imply causation rather than something specific to a particular project. Like the fact that sales went up right
after we redecorated isn't enough to make sure that redecoration caused
the increase in sales. That project specific statement is
an application of the more generic maxims. Some of these generic guide poster
in the form of commitments. I like to phrase these in the first
person, I will always do X or I will never do Y. Throughout the course, I'll be referring
to them interchangeably as ethical commitments or professional commitments. And a course on data science
ethics in this program, you'll get an ethical framework
with some sensitizing concepts and strategies for
reasoning about a situation in particular, identifying potential harms
to particular stakeholders. Here, we're focused more on what might
be called professional commitments. For example, some medical schools have
as part of their graduation ceremony, students swear to some version
of the Hippocratic oath, including the famous
line first.do no harm. Lawyers and psychiatrists have a professional
commitment to client confidentiality. Whether they are ethical or professional,
the key word for us is commitment, commitments to be our best selves are only
needed when we think that there may be temptations that would lead us astray. Thus, it will be helpful when formulating
a commitment to think about what forces might be at play. For example, the company's profit or the
managers next promotion that might push you toward an action that
betrays the commitment. If you can't think of any scenario where
there would be some force, perhaps just laziness that would push against following
the commitment, why call it a commitment? So each week, you'll write one question,
one maxim, and one commitment that are related to the project stage
that we're covering that week. And for each, you will state the generic
question, maximum commitment, explain what it means in the context
of one of the two projects. This is where you map the generic to
the specific like I did with the book and cover maximum minute ago. And then say why the project might
benefit from you asking that question or applying the maximum commitment. We've provided a sample document with
three different versions of the same questions maximum and commitments, and
some commentary on them to illustrate what makes for a better or worse way to
respond to this assignment prompt. I strongly encourage you
to look at the examples. The instructional team would be happy
to discuss them with you over Slack or in office hours. In addition to those maxims and questions, we're going to ask you to submit some
ethical commitments regarding things that you would never do or at least
not without registering a protest. For each I will never item,
you'll also give an example application. What does the commitment mean in
the context of one of the problems you articulated for
your domain of interest, and why is it important to never do
that thing that you wouldn't do? We'll be providing, that is, the
instructional team will be providing you with feedback about the things that
you submit in weeks one through three. But we're also expecting you to
provide feedback to a classmate. So you'll be assigned each week,
one classmate to share feedback with. And each of you will read the other
submission from the previous week, and then you'll meet for 30 minutes or
so by a video conference, and you'll provide feedback during the video
conference and also written feedback. We'll ask you to use the same grading
rubric that the instructional team uses. And of course, we'll then grade you
on the quality of your feedback. You'll also have an informational
interview assignment. We encourage you to find a practicing
data scientists and conduct an informational interview with them to
understand their career trajectory and what their job is like. If you're not able to find somebody,
you have an alternative. You can find a recorded interview or
read a transcript, one of the chapters from the book other
than the ones that we've given you. So in week one, we'll ask you to
identify who you would interview or what existing interview you'll use. And then by the end of week three, we'll ask you to have actually conducted
the interview or watched a red one. And we'll ask you to report on
insights that you gained from it. One other assignment you'll have
is to make a plan that describes what sources of information
about data science you plan to follow outside of the assigned
readings from this program. So that could be blogs,
podcast, newsletters, conferences that you might attend or
other sources. You'll present it as
a short bulleted list with the sentence describing why you
plan to follow that source. This is partly an exercise in discovery,
finding sources, and partly an exercise in selection. If you list too many items, you may get
feedback from the instructional team, questioning whether
your plan is realistic. And last, but not least,
both for your learning and to demonstrate your learning
to potential future employers, it's a really good idea to
conduct a personal project. Some project in your application domain of
interest that you're able to carry out on your own,
sometime during the mads program, it won't be part of any course assignment. In this course, you'll begin making
a plan for such a personal project, you won't actually have to
carry out during this course. So in particular, in week two you'll
submit a tweet length description of the project and that can be pretty
challenging to get it so short, and you can submit a couple for feedback. But by week four, you have to
submit just one for a final grade. And as I said, you're just going
to be submitting a description. You don't actually have to carry out
the personal project during this course or ever actually that we do recommend it. So here's a fun joke too close. A statistic student was completely
hungover the day of his final exam. It was a true false test, so
he decided to flip a coin for the answers. The statistics professor watched this
student for the entire two hours as he was flipping the coin, writing an answer,
flipping the coin, writing an answer. At the end of two hours,
everyone else had left the final exam, except for that one student. The professor walks up to his desk and
interrupts the students saying, listen, I have seen that you did not study for
this statistics test, you didn't even open the exam. If you're just flipping a coin for
your answer, what is taking you so long? And the student replies bitterly
as he's still flipping the coin, I'm checking my answers. I'll see you next time.
