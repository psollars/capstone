Welcome back. In
this second lecture on confidence intervals, we're going to transition from the high-level introduction to a worked example focused on a use case that's very common when you have
a single sample. How we calculate
confidence intervals, as I've already mentioned
in the prior lecture, varies depending
on the situation. We'll look at a
couple of examples. The first being when we
have a single sample, we want to calculate
the confidence interval without using bootstrapping. In order to calculate the confidence interval
for a single sample, we need four ingredients. The first is a
statistic of interest, like a mean, proportion, slope, correlation coefficient. Basically, we need a statistic that we want to estimate
the uncertainty for. The second ingredient
in our recipe is we need an expression of
uncertainty, the standard error. Recall that the standard
error quantifies the amount of variance in our
sampling distribution. In this situation, we'll estimate the standard
error analytically. That is, we're going
to use a formula to actually calculate
the standard error. Now the third ingredient, we need a sampling distribution, but we don't have one. We only have a single sample. The question is, how
will we get one? Well, we're going to
have to derive one. The two most common
forms that we use in this situation are
either the standard normal or the t-distribution. The shape of the distribution is very important because it's one factor that dictates the width of our
confidence intervals. To illustrate what we
mean by identifying an assumed shape for a
sampling distribution, let's step back for a
moment and review where the sampling distribution
fits into the process. Of course, we'll start with a population that we
want to investigate, and from that population, we collect the sample. We want to use the sample
to describe the population so we calculate a
statistic like a mean. To estimate the uncertainty
around that statistic, we need a sampling distribution. But again, we don't
have one because we don't have multiple
samples to work with, either through repeat-sampling the population or
through bootstrapping. But we can make some
assumptions about its shape. In the case of means, maybe we assume the
sampling distribution takes the shape of
the t-distribution, or we could use the
standard normal. But these are ways that we can estimate a sampling distribution
without having one. For the fourth ingredient
and the final ingredient, we need a desired level of confidence around our
sample statistics. Now we can pick any
value we want here. But the most common values
used today are the 66%, 90%, and 95% level
of confidence. The higher the level
of confidence, the wider the
confidence interval, as you will see later. Suppose we're interested in calculating the confidence
interval for a mean. Now we only have one sample, which is a common use case. Because we're estimating
the confidence interval for a mean off of
a single sample, we could either calculate
the standard error analytically or use a bootstrap. For this example, we'll use the analytical formula to
calculate the standard error. This influences our choice for ingredient number 3, the
underlying distribution. Again, as I said, common choices here include the
standard normal, the T, or the bootstrap. Because we're calculating the standard error analytically, we won't have the
bootstrap to use. The two common choices for the underlying sampling
distribution of the mean is the
normal distribution or the t-distribution. We choose the
normal distribution when the sample size is large, like more than 30, and the standard deviation
of the population is known. In this case, let's
assume we don't meet one or both of
these conditions. We use the t-distribution. We also have to pick a level of confidence for our
confidence interval. A very common choice is
95%, so we'll go with that. With this array of ingredients, our method for acquiring the
upper and lower limit of our 95% confidence
interval around our mean is to estimate
the interval analytically. To do this, we can use the confidence interval
formula for means. Now, it's not a
complicated formula. It simply states we take
the sample mean and add or subtract from it the product
of the critical value. Here we mark that as t because we're using
the t-distribution, and the standard error, here we note that as Sigma m. We'll need to calculate
the standard error using the standard deviation and the sample size of
our single sample. We'll begin the process by
identifying the values for each element in our
confidence interval formula. Let's return to our example of the height of male students at the University of Michigan. Suppose we collect a
sample of 25 students, and we calculate three
statistics from our sample. We have the sample
size, n equals 25. The sample standard
deviation, 20 centimeters. The sample mean, 175
centimeters or about 5'9". Because we're working from a single sample and
working with a mean, we can use the formula onscreen to calculate
the confidence interval. Now, let's define the
components of this formula. The first one is fairly simple. What is the sample mean? We know this value already and we can substitute it in for the x-bar at the beginning of our equation, 175 centimeters. The second value we
need to define is the standard error
of the sample. As I mentioned, calculating
the standard error for a mean can be done analytically
using a formula. The procedure here is to take the standard deviation
of our sample, in our case, the standard
deviation is 20, and dividing that value by the square root of
the sample size, called n. In our
case, n equals 25. Completing this
calculation gives us a standard error of four. We can substitute this value
for Sigma m in our equation. The last value we need to
identify is our t value, which is the critical
value we will multiply by our standard error. The critical value is the
number of standard errors we need to capture the level of confidence
we seek to estimate. In this problem, we have a
95% confidence interval, which is again the most
common confidence interval used in statistics. That will determine how large
our critical value should be as we need to capture 95% of our
sampling distribution. As you may realize,
we don't have a sampling distribution given that we're working
off a single sample. We need to assume
the shape of one. Given that we don't know the population
standard deviation, that is the standard
deviation of the height of all U of M male students, we'll use the t-distribution to determine our
critical values. Critical value is a term
that you may already be familiar with in
hypothesis testing. They help us determine
the threshold for making a determination if a result
is statistically significant. We also use them in confidence interval creation
to help us define the upper and lower bound of the confidence interval
we're trying to build. Now here you see, if we go 2.06 in either direction of
our t-distribution, we should capture about 95% of the mass of the t-distribution. But the question you
may be wondering is, how did we know to go in 2.06 in either direction
to capture that 95%? The t critical value
depends on the degrees of freedom and the
level of confidence and can be found by using a statistics table
or by using Python. Our t critical value
is associated with a 95% confidence and
a sample size of 25. We can look this
value up in a table. The table onscreen has
degrees of freedom as its rows and Alpha
as its columns. Alpha is simply one
minus our confidence. In this example,
it's 1 minus 0.95, so 0.05 is our Alpha. If we draw our attention to
the bottom right-hand corner, we find the t statistic
for 24 degrees of freedom. As a review for a
t-distribution, our degrees of freedom is
simply sample size minus 1. We also look down the
0.05 column because we're working on constructing a
95% confidence interval. The other method to get a
critical value for t is to use a statistical programming
environment like Python or perhaps R. Onscreen, I have a code snippet
for how you could use scipy.stats in Python to
calculate the critical value. My point here is that
while we can use tables to calculate
the critical value, a software is lot more
convenient and common. Once we have our three values, the sample mean,
the standard error, and the t value, we
can use the values to construct a confidence interval
around the sample mean. In this case, we simply multiply the t value by the standard
error to represent the band of uncertainty for a
95% confidence interval around the sample mean. This concludes our first example for calculating a
confidence interval. Our next example will be built on multiple samples
derived from bootstrapping.
