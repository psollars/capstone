Welcome back. In this lecture, we're going to explore
another type of uncertainty visualization
we call the spaghetti plot. We discuss ways of representing the parametric uncertainty associated with the
regression line. The competence interval pictured here is the most
commonly used technique. In today's lecture,
we're going to discuss another way to represent
this parametric uncertainty, something we call
a spaghetti plot. A confidence interval
around the regression line is a continuous
uncertainty encoding. A spaghetti plot
pictured on the right, is a discrete encoding
where we plot some of the possibilities for
the regression model given random draws of the data. This view of uncertainty has some advantages over
confidence intervals, but again, it also
has some drawbacks. Let's start with some of the advantages of
the spaghetti plot. The first area of
advantage is in something we call deterministic
construal errors. Spaghetti plots are
useful because they can address a common problem in uncertainty visualizations, deterministic construal errors. A deterministic construal error is when an individual
attempts to substitute visual
uncertainty information for deterministic information. A deterministic construal
error is a substitution. We substitute a
deterministic reading for the uncertainty expressed
in a visualization. What's an example of this? Well, the best examples
is in temperature. Suppose I was predicting the temperature a
week from today. Let's say I was estimated
to be about 20 degrees. But because it's a prediction,
there's uncertainty, and so a reasonable range
around that prediction might go from 18 degrees
to 22 degrees. However, when I present
this prediction to users, they may interpret
this as saying the temperature expected
to be 20 degrees, with a high of 22
degrees in that day, in a low of 18 degrees. In doing so, they substituted in a
deterministic reading of the data for what I originally intended to be a
communication of uncertainty. Another common example of deterministic construal
errors can be found in how people sometimes
read cartographic maps. On screen we have a map of the potential path
of a hurricane. You'll notice that
a purple cone shows the potential path of the
hurricane as it makes landfall. The purple cone gets
wider the farther we are from the current
location of the hurricane. Because the
uncertainty increases the farther we are from
the point of origin. The deterministic
construal error in this case is that users
will read the size of the cone as the size of the hurricane rather than as the uncertainty around the
path of the hurricane. One potential explanation for why deterministic
construal errors are so common is that the brain is
an expensive organ to run, it takes a lot of calories. We have this
evolutionary incentive to take the easy way out. If given an opportunity, viewers will mentally substitute something that is easier to understand over working at something that is
complex to understand. What can we do about these deterministic
construal errors? One possibility is to
use a spaghetti plot. A spaghetti plot pictured
here on the right, offers randomly
generated possible paths for the hurricane. In doing so, it presents a reasonable range for the hurricane without
giving the same sense that we are encoding the area
of the hurricane or size of the hurricane as the uncertainty encoding on the left
sometimes does, the spaghetti plot pictured
here on the right offers randomly generated possible
paths for the hurricane. In doing so, it presents a reasonable range for the hurricane without
giving the same sense that we are encoding the size of the hurricane as the uncertainty encoding on the left
sometimes does. This is a major advantage
of the spaghetti plot. Another advantage is in the area of correlated
distributions. Many times in data we deal
with correlated distributions. Suppose we start at the origin
point of the hurricane, but on the east side
of the distribution, we would expect the path
of the hurricane to end up on the south side of the
distribution at the end. The same would apply
if we start on the west side of
the origin point. If we start on the west
side of the distribution, we expect the hurricane to end farther on the north side
of the distribution. What will be unusual is if knowing the prior
position of the hurricane told you nothing about the future position
as pictured here, where the path of the hurricane meanders through and travels a path that's somewhat erratic. The point we're trying
to make here is that knowing something
about where we start should tell us
something about where we end, when the distributions
are correlated. The spaghetti plots can show this relationship
fairly effectively. Let's look at a non
cartographic example. On screen we have some
simulated time series data. Time is on the x-axis and
the data are simulated on y. The y values that occur
at later points in time are correlated with
earlier points in time. We can contrast
this with a dataset where the y data are not correlated across
the time dimension as pictured on the right. You can see how the lines move in somewhat
of an erratic fashion. Now what's interesting here is that if we put a
confidence intervals, let's say 50%, 80%, and 85% around the
high correlation data, and we do the same around
the low correlation data. What do you notice?
It turns out that the intervals on both
are exactly the same. If we just show the
confidence intervals, it's not possible to distinguish between the
high correlation plot. In the low correlation plot, this is important because when
we visualize uncertainty, we often don't show
the simulated draws, we just show the intervals. But in this case,
we can see how that obscures the nature of the
underlying relationship. That's another advantage
of the spaghetti plot. It provides more resolution to the underlying relationships. You may be wondering, It sounds
like spaghetti plots are fantastic and should be
used in all situations. While spaghetti plots are one of my favorite uncertainty
visualizations, they have limitations. To illustrate a potential
limitation of spaghetti plots, we'll start by
asking the question, which point A or B
is more likely to be hit by a hurricane
given this prediction? As I look at it, I
think the answer is B. B sits closer to the dense part of the
hurricane prediction. But users may also
notice that B sits on top of one of the random
draws of the spaghetti plot. They may assume that because it sits on top of one of the lines, that is more likely to
be hit by a hurricane. But this is not true. If we ran this ensemble again, while the overall distribution
of lines would be similar, there's randomness to the data, and the lines will be in
slightly different spots, so we can't over infer
from any one line. In this case because B sits on a line and is closest to the
dense part of the hurricane. Both of those facts run in the direction of
saying B is more likely, so even if we're making
the bad inference that B is more likely
by sitting in the line, we're still going to make
the right conclusion. That's not the case
in the neck example. Let's look at the second
example of point B and point A. In this case, point B again sits closer to the dense part of
the hurricane prediction. But A sits on top of one of the random
draws from the line. Some users may say that A is more likely to be hit
by the hurricane, even though B is actually
closer to the prediction field. Let's summarize. Spaghetti plots are discrete
encoding alternative to confidence intervals. An advantage of spaghetti
plots is that they're more effective at mitigating deterministic construal errors. The disadvantage, however, of spaghetti plots is that
their random draws can be interpreted as the
representation of the possible rather than a
representation of the possible. That's it for spaghetti
plots for now. I hope you enjoyed the lecture.
