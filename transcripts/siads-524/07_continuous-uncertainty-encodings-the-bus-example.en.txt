Welcome back. This lecture is called continuous
uncertainty encodings. The bus example. In this lecture, we're going to look at
two types of continuous uncertainty in encodings, PDFs and CDFs. Let's get started. Continuous uncertainty
encoding is a type of data visualization that allows you
to represent uncertainty or variability through continuous
representation of the data. In each of these encodings, the visual
representation of the data provides information about the range of values
that measures or estimates might take and the degree of confidence in that range. Continuous uncertainty encodings
are often used in scientific and engineering contexts
where the measurement and estimates can be influenced by a variety
of sources of error or uncertainty. By encoding this uncertainty
in the data visualization, analysts can better understand
the limitations of the data and make more informed decisions
based on that information. Now, we've discussed cumulative
distribution functions, CDFs and probability distribution
functions PDFs in prior lectures. CDFs and PDFs are both specific examples of what
we call continuous uncertainty encodings. These representations of uncertainty are
called continuous uncertainty encodings because they involve encoding uncertainty
through a continuous distribution rather than a discrete distribution. In this lecture, we're going to explore
an example from the uncertainty research group at Northwestern University. The lead author of this particular
example is Matthew Kay. So we're going to use a paper Kay and
others wrote entitled is my boss. This paper explores methods for presenting
uncertainty for a transportation example. So suppose you're living in Seattle,
Washington in the United States. The bus company displays
on a digital board, the approximate time the bus
will arrive at each stop. So for example, it notes that bus 120 should be at
the Downtown Center in about 11 minutes. Having read this,
we might set our watches to 11 minutes and go grab a coffee from
the nearby coffee stand. But before we go, we notice something in
the fine print at the bottom of the sign. A note reads, bus arrival
estimates are based on the best available information, but
actual times will vary. Traffic and other conditions can affect
the accuracy of this information. In other words, there's uncertainty. There's uncertainty as to the exact
location of the bus at any given point. There's also uncertainty into
what traffic looks like. So given that there is uncertainty, perhaps we should explore
how we can model it. We'll focus on using two statistical
distributions, the PDF and CDF. So again, the question we're asking
ourselves is do we have enough time to go and get a coffee? Now, there's not enough information for
me to make an informed decision. I know that the best estimate the app can
provide is that the bus will arrive in about 11 minutes. But with no quantification of uncertainty, I don't know how much earlier
than 11 minutes the bus might be. So what the system is telling us is that
the bus will come sometime between 0 and 30 minutes from now, or
maybe even further in the future. The system prediction is that the bus will
show up 11 minutes from now, exactly. But there's obviously uncertainty
around that point estimate. A more realistic and
a better representation would be one that uses some kind of probability
distribution around the point estimate. I would acknowledge that the bus might
not come exactly 11 minutes from now. The display suggests that it
might come sometime between 5 and 20 minutes with the most likely
value being about 11 minutes. But there's a long tail to
the right where perhaps traffic and other events might delay the bus. This is helpful. But suppose I wanted to know if
I had time to go get a coffee. Let's say there's
a nearby coffee stand and it takes eight minutes to get a coffee. Do I have time to get the coffee? This display doesn't quite
answer that question. I need a little bit more information. So we add to our display
a mark at 8 minutes and find that 90% of the time the bus
comes later than 8 minutes. That's a lot more useful information. It helps me quantify the risk
of getting a coffee. Am I fine with missing the bus 10% of
the time if it means I can enjoy a coffee 100% of the time? Now you may recognize this
kind of uncertainty display. It's called a probability density plot. It's a helpful way to think
about the problem, but this kind of view also has limitations. It encodes one estimate of risk,
in this case, a 90% likelihood of catching the bus. Now that may be great for
some people but not others. Also the amount of risk we're willing
to accept could flex depending on the situation. If I were going for a job interview, for example, I might want to be as close
to 100% sure I would make the bus. If I were going to the library, I might
be less concerned with missing the bus. It would depend on the situation. And this view doesn't really support
multiple situations as well. The probability density plot has another
limitation in that it relies on area to convey the probability. It can be difficult to
accurately read area, which we can illustrate
through an example. On screen, we have a couple of circles. And the question I'd like to ask you
is this, what proportion of the outer circles area is covered by the inner
circle as a value of 0 to 100%. In other words, how much of the big
circle does a small spur circle cover? Take a moment and think about that. Now, if you're like, most people,
you might estimate that the inner circle covers about 85,
maybe even 90% of the outer circle. In fact, the true proportion is 75%. The smaller circle is three quarters
the size of the larger circle, but it looks a little bit bigger than that. The reason is that area
perception in humans is biased. As things get larger, we don't perceive
them as being proportionally as large as what they actually are. As a result, you don't see the larger
circles being quite as big as it really is compared to the smaller circle. So you just think the smaller circle is
a larger proportion of the bigger circle. So returning to our density plot,
we may want a different way to display the probabilistic prediction
of the bus's arrival time. We want an option that's less reliant
on people accurately reading area. Now, one option is to use a display
that doesn't rely on area at all to read probability and it can offer
probability for any bus arrival time. If this sounds familiar, it should. What I'm describing is a cumulative
distribution function. Here's a cumulative distribution
function for our bus problem. Like our density plot, the x-axis is
the time the bus arrives, the y-axis is the cumulative probability of the bus
arriving at that time or earlier. So if for example, we wanted to know if
our coffee took a little longer to get one day, and it took 10 minutes to
purchase and get back to the stop. What's the probability
that we will miss the bus? We see that at 10 minutes,
the CDF returns a probability of 25%. So what does this mean? It means that there's a 25%
chance the bus has already come. This example also reveals something
else that's important for us to note around how we might have to
layer uncertainty upon uncertainty. We started this scenario saying it takes
8 minutes to get a coffee and then said, well, sometimes it actually takes 10
minutes, just depends on the line, there's uncertainty in the coffee time. So we took a look at the CDF at 8 minutes
which yielded a 10% probability of missing the bus, and we already know there's a 25%
probability that we missed the bus if our coffee takes 10 minutes. So if we go to get a coffee, there's approximately a 10 to 25%
probability that I missed the bus. Let's connect what we were doing
here back with a few other lectures. First, let's reinforce the connection
between a probability density function and a cumulative distribution function. You may also remember that we said the CDF
is equal to the integral of the PDF. If we integrate from negative infinity
through a value, in this case 10, we get the cumulative probability for
10 or less. Let's also review how the of
graphics can aid in the creation and evaluation of these
graphical distributions. Starting with the density plot, we see
that time is mapped to the x channel. The density function f bus,
takes time as its input and outputs density values which
are mapped to the exposition. These values are marked through a line. Now, these are explicit encodings. That is the specification we use to
create the probability density plot. These are required elements to visually create the PDF rendering
of the bus problem. One thing you might notice probability
isn't in our list of explicit mappings. That's because probability is
implicitly encoded onto area. The area is created from the explicit
encoding of density onto the y channel. This is one of the limitations of the PDF,
that probability is mapped implicitly to area which we have noted
is not very easy to read accurately. So while it does a great job of giving
the overall shape of the distribution, it can be difficult to
read probability from it. If we contrast this
implementation of the of graphics with the cumulative distribution function,
we see similarities and differences. Once again, we map time to the x
channel and a statistical distribution, in this case, the CDF to the y channel,
and we mark it as a line. These are similar to the PDF we just saw. The difference of course is
that while probability was implicitly mapped on a PDF,
it's explicitly mapped in the CDF. The CDF does not rely on
implicit encoding of probability, probability can be read
directly from the y-axis. This is one of the great
advantages of the CDF. The disadvantage of the CDF is that
its overall shape lacks some of the intuition we get from the pure
distribution approach of the PDF. Density plots generated from a PDF and
cumulative distribution function plots are two examples of
continuous uncertainty encodings. We should also note that
the visualizations built on a probability density function
can take several forms. We've covered density plots and CDFs,
but there are other alternatives. The violin plot uses densities to
vary the thickness of the display. Gradient plots, another type of continuous uncertainty
encoding maps density onto opacity. CCDFs are again similar to CDFs
in that they map probability and not probability density to height. So let's sum up. In this lecture, we explored
continuous uncertainty encodings, specifically focusing on density plots and
CDF plots. CD F plots and
density plots provide trade-offs for how they visualize uncertainty. Density plots are intuitive but
difficult to read directly. CDF plots are easy to read directly but
they're less intuitive. We also have other continuous
encoding options like violin plots, gradient plots and CCDF plots.
