Welcome back. In this lecture, we'll discuss
another discrete outcome encoding, the hypothetical outcome plot or HOP. To introduce the hypothetical
outcome plot, we will return to the familiar
context of linear regression. Now, you may recall
that in prior lectures, we discussed one way to
represent uncertainty around an individual regression model
is to use a confidence interval. The confidence interval represents
parametric uncertainty for the model. The confidence interval is also a
continuous representation of uncertainty. We also looked at how to represent
the same uncertainty using a discrete encoding like a spaghetti plot. These types of encodings
make it more difficult for the audience to ignore the uncertainty
because we don't give a single line of best fit, but
many possible lines of fit. I like spaghetti plots. They're versatile and effective, but they're not
the only option available to us. Another discrete encoding option
is the hypothetical outcome plot. A hypothetical outcome plot takes the
individual draws from a spaghetti plot and runs them through like
a movie making an animation. What makes a HOP effective is
it really emphasizes that each draw is just one possible of many. By cycling through the draws and
the fundamental variation they illustrate, we gain an appreciation for
the underlying uncertainty. It gives people a way of experiencing
the uncertainty in hopefully a more intuitive way. We use the same process as
creating a spaghetti plot. But rather than put all
the lines on one frame, we spread them out over
many frames across time. Hypothetical outcome plots can be
helpful in aiding against deterministic construal errors. The image on the left is one
that we've looked at already. It's a spaghetti plot showing the
uncertainty of the path of the hurricane. Now, we might interpret that if
a particular spot on the map is crossed by a line or draw, it's more likely
to be hit by the hurricane. This is not the case. Now, we can use the mass of lines
to roughly understand which regions of the map are more or
less likely to be in the hurricane's path. But an individual line is just
a random draw of the model, just represents uncertainty. We can use a HOP to illustrate
the same phenomenon where we animate the individual draws over time. As you can see, individual draws are
animated in and out of the view over time. Given enough draws, you're still going to
run into situations where a draw might intersect with a particular city or
region. Now you may wonder how is this
more effective than the original spaghetti plot at mitigating
deterministic construal errors? Well, the argument is that given
that the draws fade in and out. It becomes a bit more obvious that these
draws are part of a random process and should not be interpreted
deterministically. Let's return to a couple of
data series that we looked at previously that illustrate high and
low correlation. If we overlay confidence
intervals on these data series, starting with high correlation and
then ending with low correlation. And then if we remove
the underlying data from view, we see that the line of best fit with
the confidence interval obscures the underlying relationship
differences between these data sets. HOPs can help with this problem. To illustrate how HOps can help
with this correlated data problem, let's look at the unemployment data
in the United States over time. Here we have the unemployment trend. At the end of this series, we have a forecast which is
obviously clouded by uncertainty. The problem with this gradient view
of uncertainty is that it obscures the correlation in the predicted
region in the red box. If the unemployment starts low,
does it stay low or does it drift up? We really can't tell from
this view of uncertainty. Instead, we can use a hypothetical outcome
plot to show the correlated nature of the data. So here, each draw that we're showing
is one possible predicted future path. And we can tell how the data generally
are predicted to move over time. Another option we have is to
combine the spaghetti plot with the hypothetical outcome plot. So here we have the best of both worlds. In the background, we have spaghetti plot showing a discrete
encoding of many possible paths. But it's overlay with
hypothetical outcome plot. Again, reinforcing that each one
of these is just a random draw. Now, as we've seen in this lecture, HOPs
and spaghetti plots have similarities and differences. To summarize, let's compare and contrast
the hop with the spaghetti plot to gain an appreciation for what's similar and
what's different between them. First, both spaghetti plots and hypothetical outcome plots are discrete
encodings, as we've already mentioned. Now, a continuous encoding by way of
review is like a confidence interval. A discrete encoding is something
where we plot individual elements. One way in which spaghetti plots and hypothetical outcome plots differ is
the medium that's appropriate for each. A hypothetical outcome plot only works for
digital media, so on screen displays only. This is a limitation to the HOP, as some organizations still rely
on print media to share insights. If we're sharing insights in print or
in other formats that do not easily support animation, spaghetti
plots are a much better choice than HOPs. Another difference between
spaghetti plots and HOPs is the encoding mechanism
that each relies on. Spaghetti plots map to spatial frequency,
lines occupying a space, whereas HOPs tend to rely on temporal
frequency, draws mapped across time. Are both of these approaches effective
against certain types of deterministic construal errors? The answer is yes for both. Depending on the application,
we may prefer hops or spaghetti plots, but both tend to help with
deterministic construal errors. Lastly, are these plots effective
against correlation issues, as we saw in this lecture and
the spaghetti plot lecture? The answer for both is yes. As you can see, the spaghetti plot and
the HOP plot have some similarities and they have some differences. In my personal view, it's the medium
that really drives the decision here. If you plan on sharing your work in print, you're going to have to
use a spaghetti plot. If you're sharing your work digitally,
you have a choice. That's it for this lecture on
hypothetical outcome plots. Our last discrete encoding. I hope you enjoyed it.
