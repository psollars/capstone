Hi, welcome to the capstone. My name's Dr. Elle O'brian
and I'm going to be the lead instructor for your capstone of
the MADS program. The objective of this capstone is that you're going to
be working to create portfolio worthy projects
that demonstrate mastery of the Data
Science skills that you've learned so
far in the curriculum, as well as depth of knowledge in a particular subject area. This is your opportunity
to announce that you've arrived essentially in the data science community
of professionals. You are going to
have the chance to test some of the skills that
you've developed so far, as well as to push yourself in ways that you might not have
gotten the chance to yet, but are really interested in. You can start to develop some of your own personal brand by
pursuing your interests, and take these opportunities to challenge yourself by going further than you
previously have. I'm going to give a little
bit of an overview of the course and just some of
the logistics around this. First of all, you've
probably already noticed that you'll be
working in teams of three. In the real-world, a lot of data science doesn't
happen independently, almost everything is going
to involve some teamwork. Even if you're the sole
data scientist on the team, you'll often be working
with the data engineer, possibly someone on a front end, as well as people in
business analytics or whatever the application
of your project is. Some domain experts and
working with others is actually one of the
core challenges of real-world applied
data science, it is not as easy as it seems. This is going to be your
chance to confront some of those problems in
a setting that is somewhat emulative of
what you might encounter in the real-world with
all of the code sharing, project management,
headaches, and glories that that contains. In this class, we are going
to have weekly office hours, instructors will be offering
regular office hours. Office hours are not required
or expected of you and we will not be having any planned reviews or
curriculum in them, office hours are for coming by and getting yourself unstuck. If you find yourself unable to move past part of your project, that's a good idea then, to come and talk to me or another instructor and we
can help you get unstuck. Some of the things we can
help you with our scoping. Trying to figure out
if you want to keep or reject part of your
original project proposal, how to deal with something
that's turned out to be a lot more challenging
than you thought, or perhaps, finding
something to be, just anything that's
more difficult than you expected, we
can help with that. Come by if you have a question, if you come by and you
don't have any questions, then we'll probably
just hang out and we'll probably just end
up going around and sharing what
we're working on. In addition to office hours, you can also schedule
one-on-one time with myself and other members
of the instructional team, so you can think of
us as consultants, we are data science
consultants that are here to give our thoughts
and opinions to you. Anytime that you think you could use a little bit of extra input, come to us and while it is not
required that you used us, I strongly recommend it. Please avail yourself of the expert advice that
is available to you. Another part of this course
is going to be stand-ups. Because of this is going to be essentially eight weeks
of work on your projects, there's not as many
opportunities to check in with your
other classmates. We're going to have every
two weeks a stand-up where your team will submit a short video to check in
about how you're doing. I will go over this in
more detail shortly, but basically the
idea is that we're emulating a company that might
have many teams within it. If you were to work
somewhere like Microsoft or Facebook or Amazon, they're comprised of hundreds of smaller teams that
each have their own goal, but we still want to stay
in touch with one another somehow so that we can
inspire one another, help each other get unstuck and celebrate things that
are going really well. We're going to be having a biweekly asynchronous video stand up and I will teach
you how to do that soon. Finally, you'll be submitting
your final projects, we have a Coursera
submission form, final projects will
consist of a blog post, a short overview video, and a GitHub project repository. You can share those with
me and I am not picky whatsoever about the
format of your blog. Seriously, just use whatever
is going to help you express your ideas best whatever way you'd
like to publish it in. If it is a real blog
that you have submitted, if it's a really detailed
Jupyter Notebook, it could be a preprint for
an academic type paper, it could be something else. I will not be picky
as long as it has readable words on it and that I can assess it for the value that it brings
as a data science project. I'm really looking
forward to seeing what things you create
in this project. Like I said, this is a chance
to push yourself and help define what your interests and assets are as
a data scientist. I'm really excited to
see what you create, you've got two months of protected time to build
something that you think is really cool and I can't wait to see
where you go with it. Like I've said, think of me and the other data science
instructors here as consultants that are
here to help you, make the thing that you are
feeling so excited about.
