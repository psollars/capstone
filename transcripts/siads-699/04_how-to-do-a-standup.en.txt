I mentioned to you
that we're going to do some biweekly stand-ups, so here's what to
do in a stand-up. Some of you who might have
worked at tech companies or similar organizations might
already know about them, but if you're new, here is roughly what we're going to do. When it comes time
for your stand-up, you're going to get
on your webcam, or your screen recording tool, doesn't matter.Z You can
show your face or not, and you're going to answer
the following questions. What did my team work
on this past week? What are we working on now? What issues are blocking us? Even if you're not especially
blocked by anything, just say what are some of
the challenges that you're facing or things that
you're not sure of. To emphasize here,
any team member can make the recording, so it doesn't have to be
everybody on the team. I just want one
representative from the team to make
the stand-up and feel free to use your
screen-sharing to show us any code snippets
or cool results. It can be quite casual, this is not a presentation, this is a check-in. If you're facing something that is little difficult
or incomplete, then that actually could be good for your classmates to see. They might have an opinion on it or a suggestion or
it might just make somebody else who's dealing with that feel a little bit better, so please don't be
afraid to be a little bit authentic here about
what you're dealing with. One more thing, there are
no hard limits on time, but the ideal would be about
three to five minutes. If you go over, that's fine, if you go under, that
can also be okay. We're not enforcing any limits, I just want you to
do the exercise and help us understand
what you were working on. Finally, let me tell you
how to share your stand-up. What you're gonna do is upload your video to your
U-M google Drive. You could also upload it to a personal YouTube channel or another video hosting service. It doesn't really matter
as long as it's somewhere that you can upload the video
and share a link to it. There is limited
storage space on Slack, so please don't directly
upload your video to Slack. Upload the video and then you're going to go in the stand-ups
channel and copy and paste a link to
the recording and make sure permissions are set so your classmates can view it. In the message body, please write your team
name and then stand up. The team name is going
to be the unique names of your teammates in
alphabetical order. Unique names is just your University of
Michigan email address. For example, it would
be Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, stand up,
and that's it. Then I will be asking
you to watch and comment on two other
classmates stand-ups, one stand up per team every
two weeks, don't worry, I will remind you
when they are coming, you will not be in
the dark about this, and I can also create, you know, I'll put one in the channel, a demo, so you can
see a real one. Stand-ups are a really
popular way that a lot of organizations help their members stay responsible for their work, stay on task,
motivate one another, and just build a
sense of community. It's just really cool to get to see what you're
working on and to watch your project and other
people's unfold over time. I am looking forward to seeing you in the stand-up channel.
