Well, thank you all for
joining to learn more about SIAD 699 Capstone and our client-sourced
datasets that we have available for you
this upcoming session. I'm Maggie Broadbeck. I'm from the Engaged Learning
Office at UMSI. If you haven't
heard of us before, we are an office that
works directly with students to provide professional experience
that employers seek. These are typically mutually
beneficial experience for students and our partners. These are client-based projects. We work hand in hand
with faculty to bring these projects
into the curriculum. We also do some
co-curricular opportunities which you should start to
see more come into maths. We have several
other ELO members on the call with us, Lorie, Gabby, Lara, and Kelly who may
speak up at times. Here's our SIAD 699 Capstone
course description, which I'm sure you all
are very familiar with. But we have Dr. Elle O'Brien
on the call today as well, who's a faculty this semester in case there are any questions relating to learning objectives
or Capstone curriculum. Elle, is anything
you want to add? Yeah. I'll just
really briefly say. The Capstone, I hope it's one of your most fun classes because
if you get to take on a creative project and
show what you know, some people use it
as a little bit of an independent
study to go deeper into a topic that they
really care about. But it's also about using the skills that you have to make something more complex and interesting than you've
ever done before, making something that helps you establish your professional
identity going forward. So a portfolio piece. There's a lot of
opportunities to really push yourself
and get creative. A lot of data science work is fundamentally very creative. We've never done this
before where we've had these client-based projects. So this is like a pilot. If you choose to take on
one of these projects, people have a lot of latitude
to define the projects that they want to
work on and you can make your own project. But it's also really
cool to get to work on a project that
is of interest to a client because of then you get this experience of getting to really work with someone. It's probably a bit more
realistic to what you might encounter on the job and
you have these constraints. The constraints are always where things get interesting
of how do you use the resources you have
to make something that works for what
your client needs. Basically what I'm
inviting you to do in this is if you
are interested in one of these projects to
become a collaborator with me and the rest of
the teaching team about piloting this experience, we're going to be like taking notes about how does this go, what works, what did you learn from it,
what parts were hard. We're really excited
for anybody who wants to be one of our pioneers. We very much welcome
your feedback on what works and what
doesn't with this. Formats. For the
specific instance, we're defining it
two different ways. We have our
client-sourced datasets versus our
client-sourced projects. It's a little
different than some of our other courses
which just have client-based or
client-sourced projects just because of the
way it operates. I'll get into those definitions. We're defining a
client-sourced dataset as a real world dataset
that may not be freely accessible on the Internet
and has a contact to provide access and answer
questions about the dataset. They may provide
some recommendations on the type of analyses
that can be performed, but there are no strictly
defined outcomes. I will say all of them
are very interested in hearing with what you
discovered from their data. These are not your traditional
client engagement, knowing that students are across different time zones and it's a shortened timeframe than our standard client-based
courses in UMSI. Multiple student groups can
work with a single dataset. Our client-sourced
project still a dataset, but it's provided by a client with defined
outcomes and deliverables. They have a very specific analysis that they
are looking for. Students will engage
directly with these clients to determine how best to
achieve these outcomes. With these, only
one student group can be matched to a project. Another way of looking at these is our client-sourced datasets. A lot of these are coming
from UM units for this pilot, and our client-sourced
projects are coming mostly from companies and
nonprofit organizations. Are there any questions? We'll also have
time at the end of questions as we
move through here. With their client sourced
datasets and projects, some of these do come with
non disclosure agreements. UMSI does not require
organizations to use NDAs, but many often choose to have
students sign them anyways. At the beginning of Capstone, you will be shared
proposal documents and the list of the projects
in the proposal documents. All the NDA's will
be linked so you can review them prior to
selecting a project. Most of our clients use templated versions created
by UMSI that allow students to freely speak with their faculty and instructional
team about the projects. But we really encourage
you to review the NDAs and ask questions to the
client if there are any concerns on those. Our office cannot
provide legal advice, but we can try to direct you in the right direction if you
have questions about those. Some of these do
not require NDA's, which is what we
always encourage. A few things to know, a lot of this is reiterating
what else said, but you are not required to
work with the clients first. Data sets and projects interest
in these opportunities will be indicated in class and matches made by the
instructional team. After class begins, you'll get access to this spreadsheet. We're about to review folder that has all of
the documents from the clients and these documents include contextual information
about the organization, about the data,
how to access it, and then contact information
from the clients. We're going to go
do a quick overview of what's available. We have eight different
opportunities. The first three are our datasets for this
upcoming session. These all come from UM
departments and units. Our first one is from civil and environmental
engineering, which there is real time drinking water quality
data at the point of use. This is related to our Hema, if you've heard
about that, which is water conservation and access, this dataset is drinking water quality parameters from 24 different homes in Detroit. There's a lot of
different analyses and prediction that can
be made using this. There's roughly 200,000 data points On the right side here, you can see which
ones require NDA's, which ones do not. The next one we have is Michhigan Medicine and's Pharmacy Administration
Department. This is health system
pharmacy workload modeling. They have data that can be like users who completed
work associated shifts. It can be used to
assess, predict, and optimize
pharmacy operations. They are really interested
in hearing what you find out from this data and the contact for the data set is actually
Mads alumni as well. He is really interested in helping students
guide their project. The last data that
we have is UM, climate and space
sciences and engineering. It's understanding the insitu
solar wind properties with machine learning and
artificial intelligence. This is really cool. It's solar wind
plasma data obtained from the Ace and solar
orbiter missions. They are just really
interested in seeing all the different types of
machine learning models that can be applied to it. They've listed a few, but they're always interested
in hearing more. Their space scientists
would really like to see the insights
you find with this data. With this one they said
some physics background is nice to have
but not required. All of these documents will have things that might be nice to have skills with these
but not always required. Those are datasets
that are available. The next are projects
which are still datasets, but they have defined
outcomes Fix6. This is a data company that works with agricultural
and supply chains. They have climate risk and opportunities for
permanent agriculture. This one is more student guided, but basically they want
to predict climate risk using climate geospatial data, which comes from their
own API that they've created with this one. They are really interested
in the students guiding. If you are from Michigan and you want to look at
Michigan climate risk, you can or wherever you're from. This one is a bit
more technically advanced in terms of computing. It's a large amount of data you have to connect
to their existing API. But the clients very interested in guiding students on that. The next one we have
is Michigan Medicine. This is the Physician
Organization of Michigan ACO. This is beneficiary
rising risk ratification. Try saying that five times fast. This is development of risk
ratification methodology. Methodology, so basically evaluating which
patients may become more sicker or more expensive based on historic
claims to Medicare. There's a lot of different data here that can be explored, if you're interested
in healthcare data, this would be a
great opportunity. We have the Social Media
Research Foundation. They have their
NodeXL application, which is a tool for visualizing, collecting different information on social media networks. They mostly work with X, but they're seeking to
diversify from that. This project would be looking at other platforms that
could be connected to it and implementing
those features, so a lot of network-based
analysis here. Visible Alpha, this is stock and portfolio level
return forecasting. I've heard this is a
favorite of med students, but you can build models, forecasting future returns at the stock and portfolio level using the expectations data. If you're very interested
in the financial space, this would be a great
opportunity for you. Last but not least, we have settle it in the Cypher. This is a very fun one. It's competitive breaking, which is competitive
break-dancing. If you're interested
in sport analytics, they are looking to develop
a data management strategy and bring in more data about competitive break-dancing
and analyzing that. Just to reiterate, these are
our client-based projects, so we would like to see only one student group
matched to them, but our client-based datasets, multiple students
can work with these. You'll receive all this
information when class begins. We'll get access to this folder, which has more description and
context on these projects. Are there any questions? Hi, there. This Aaron Newman. I am curious about
how an NDA might impact what the student team is able to publicly deliver as
deliverables for the class. If you'd normally say, here's my GitHub repo, here's my poster,
here's my video, or those things that depending
on the project we might be restricted from sharing outside of the faculty and the customer. This is something I would
encourage you to speak with the client about as it may
change based on others. Everyone will be different, but I'm sure some
will still allow for some description to be
shared with employers. Okay. Fair enough. Arturo. Thank you. A quick question. Like you said, for the matching
one group per project, how would that process work? Let's say there's
multiple teams that want to get matched
with that project, how would that process work? I might let Elle
speak to this one. The way that I'm planning
to run this is that, usually in the capstone, we have a team-matching
process where people can identify people
they want to work with, but can also just say, I don't know what I want to work on and I'll
do the matching. What I'm going to add to that
survey is you can put like a first and second
choice for if you want a certain project. If there's more people
that want to work on one project than the
project can handle, then I'll do a random selection, and anybody who doesn't get it, I'll try to match to
their second choice. I don't know what will happen, it could be that there's
just the right number of people for everything and everybody gets
their first choice. There might be lots of
people want one and only a randomly chosen
few will get that one. But if you don't get it, I will still do my
best to match you with either your backup choice, or if you don't have one
to find something that is similar or a team
that has something similar going on for them. Thank you. Appreciate it. Well, hopefully it
works out well that everyone can work on something
that they want to though. Hello everyone. Hello. My name is Junior Zephir. I'm located in Dallas, Texas. I plan to take my
capstone in February. I have a question
about the project. I would like to know if the
project related to client. I would like to know if
the student will have some coach directly
from the client. Can you repeat the question? I would like to know if student work with
a client project, if we will have a
coach from the client. Yeah, the client will provide context and
answer questions. I think the instructional team is also there to
provide support. Yeah. In addition to
working with the client, I'm sure that if you
work on one of those, you would probably
agree with them how often you want
to meet or check in about it and you might decide we're going to
check in over email, or maybe you want to
have a video call with them on a certain schedule. But in addition to that, every team gets a
faculty mentor. This is true for
everybody in class. Whether or not you work on
a client project or not, you're going to have a faculty
advisor who is overseeing your project and
who you can meet to check in with and you can set your own
schedule with them. We do have some mandatory
check-in points, but you could also
say you want to do more or you will communicate
with them through Slack. You can ask them
questions too about the data science
aspects of a project. I know that some projects
have an NDA and maybe you can't say everything about
it to the faculty advisor. But in my residential classes, I've worked with
students who are on NDAs and we still talk about things like how does
this clustering method work, or I'm having this problem with my data, what do you think? They're usually
able to still get some coaching without going too deep into the
specifics of that, whatever might be behind an NDA. Does that answer your question? Yeah, that's fine. One more question
about the deliverable. Does the client will have full access with
our deliverables? For example, if the
client would like to implement the
project, so then, does the client will
have full access without any concern from the student group or the student team or the
faculty, something like that? When you say full access, you mean access to your code? No, even the code
and the market, the deliverable, the pro doc. For example, if I have to build a machine learning related
to a specific project, so if the client would like
to implement the project, so we'll have full
access on the pro code? I think it depends on what the deliverable is that the
client is looking for. Some clients, I think what
they want is a report; they want you to write
up what you did, some projects might
want working code, so it would depend on what their expectation was for
the final deliverable. That makes sense. I will say with some clients
you aren't necessarily working with a data scientist
or a data engineer, so they may not have some of that more technical
data background that our MAD students
are interested in, so in those cases, they may just be
interested in report. Thank you. I do have a question. Yeah. Yes, so timing, I know you presented
these datasets, some projects, I think, for the capstone that's
going to start February. Is that an urgency to complete those projects in
this iteration? I'm thinking I'm taking a
capstone in the summer, so I don't know if
this is a once-a-year thing that you guys are doing or it should be for every semester. Our goal is to get this
going for every semester. In some cases,
maybe if a project isn't selected by this
term of capstone, we may push it forward
to the next one. But that will be a
stay-tuned question. The datasets, I think, are going to be available. The datasets that are available
are probably evergreen. That's designed
for the long term, so I imagine those datasets
will still be here. Yes. Thank you. Just one more point that we have that we
want to make you all aware of is the UMSI
Student Project Exposition, or Expo, as you might
hear it called. This is our annual poster fair to exhibit the exceptional work done by our students in their courses and
co-curricular programs. The students who
participate have the opportunity to
win cash awards, which includes a MADS capstone. You will be able to
enter this semester. We have this every year so don't worry if you're not
in this capstone. You'll have the opportunity
to enter next time. We do offer virtual
accommodations for our MADS students and more info will come soon on how to register for this
and present that. Any lingering questions? Looks like Marianne has one. For that poster exhibition, how are the posters evaluated? That is a good question. Would Kelly maybe be able to speak to that? She's gone? Yes. Hold on just a sec. This will probably
be tweaked over the next couple of months but the judging
was new last year, and so we had judges
and they come from their alums, and
industry representatives look at project
conceptualization; is the problem
statement well defined, is it match with the
work you present on. Does it align with what you say the problem statement is? Does it align with the category? Also, there's MADS Capstone, which if you do a MADS Capstone project, you
automatically align. But there are also
thematic categories. And then there's poster
and presentation. Is the poster well defined? Are the outcomes
matched with the goals, are you aligning that,
and how impactful do you deem the project to be? I would say because
of the nature of our judges, we don't get into the methodological critique because sometimes the judges are data scientists,
but they also might be a CEO of a company who is interested in that. Oftentimes in posters,
the methodology and the techniques are not always super well
covered so that you're not actually
evaluated on that. But those are the things
that we've done in the past. Again, we might tweak
them a little bit, but I don't see us varying
too much from that. I think if you go to our website as well, you can see past winners from the MADS Capstone. Yeah, and it is a
really cool experience because the judges are
really neat people, and then having a poster
session, win or not, although the cash
prize is very nice. But it is a really
good experience to get to talk to
the judges too so I think all around
it's pretty fun. Also, is there remote
virtual participation? Can I participate that, but not be physically there? Yes, there's in-person
and remote tracks. Okay. Cool. But we have had MADS students actually come for,
should be there in person which is super cool, but you don't have
to by any means. I can speak more specifically about this if there's interest. If not, you can read
the emails that will come out with
the details on this. It will be well described. Then generally a bit late. Let's say, I'm interested. What are the steps
to do from now? For the client-based projects? Yes. Let's say I'm
interested, what next step? Yeah. So Elle is
going to share those when class begins in February, and I know she has a process if she wants to speak to that. Really briefly, it'll
be that when we all get into, I think
it's next week. Everybody will get
into the Coursera shell and the Slack channel, and then you're going to have in the first week
of class some time to read all the
documents for class, like read the
syllabus, read about the project, and read through the different client
project descriptions. Then by the end of the week, you'll fill out a
survey which says what you're interested
in working on. And then I will match
people to projects, trying to take your
preferences into account. Pretty much all you have to do the first week is read
up on the projects, decide if you're
interested in one and there will be a
survey, and you will indicate if you would
like to work on one. You might have missed this, but if there's more
people interested in one project than the
project can handle, I'll randomly select who gets it and other people will be assigned to their second choice. But I'm hopeful that
we'll get everybody matched well to what
they want to do. Thank you. So nothing you need
to do right now. All of it should be
clear when we start.
