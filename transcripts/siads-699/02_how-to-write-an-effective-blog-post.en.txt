It's not enough to just do data science
on your own computer, you have to be able to communicate what you've done
in order for your work to have impact. And I really think that communication
is one of the most underappreciated but completely critical aspects
of any data science project. So here are some tips for when you're
turning in your blog or your overview, video or any other aspect of communicating
about what you're doing here and pretty much forever in your whole career. I really think this is quite important. First off explicitly
state your work's value. Value can be broadly interpreted here. It could be that something
has never been done before. It could be that it is a new finding or
a new result. It could be that you've done something
that other people have done but you're doing it faster or
without a certain headache involved. Make sure you let other people know why
they should care about what you're doing. So be really explicit. Like if you think you've been explicit,
go back and rewrite it even more explicit and in simpler language about
why your work matters next. You should interpret your results for
the reader. Do not just put up a graph or
a table and assume that they will, whoever is reading it will be
able to understand what it means. You have to be the translator from
your data or your modelling results or your technical result to the person
who is going to be impacted by it. So if you have a boss, perhaps
you're out of business and you are, the data scientist,
you have to communicate that and interpret your result in a way that
a business leader is going to understand. Don't leave it up to them to draw their
own conclusions, that's your job. And if it's something for the public, it's even more important
to do the interpreting. As we've seen a lot in,
the covid pandemic. It's quite risky in some context
to just leave some numbers up and let people make their own
decisions about them. You have to tell them are we
certain about these numbers? Are these numbers that we should be making
a decision based on what decision would I make based on these numbers and
based on my expert opinion, that's the kind of thing that
you want to be providing. So do not assume that your
reader can do that work for themselves a lot of times they can't. And that's why you're the expert plots and tables need to correspond
to beats of your story. So if you're going to include a plot or
a table, make sure that it's something that
comes up in the narrative of your work. So perhaps if you have, it's fine to have a picture that
illustrates how your model works or the model architecture works, but make
sure that gets referenced in the text. Don't just show results for
the sake of showing more results. If they don't actually matter
to the conclusions and the results that you're making best
just to put them in independence. So as you're writing, have a story and
make sure that everything that you mentioned, if you have a figure,
it better get mentioned and it better get explained in the text,
justify your technical decisions. One of the difficult parts of reaching
this stage of your data science career is that you have a lot more independence,
but also more responsibility. You are responsible for the technical
decisions that you make in your work. And sometimes honestly, most of the time
there's not going to be an exactly right answer for
what model should you have used? How should you have processed your data? Should you have excluded
this from your data? Those are often just up to you. But what's most important is that you
justify your technical decisions and the reader can understand why
you made those decisions. So if you're going to exclude some
data from your analysis, tell us why. If you're going to pick a certain modeling
family over another, just say why. And it doesn't even have to be a super
detailed explanation a lot of the time. Just let us know why the choice was made. You want to provide enough resources for highly technical readers
to replicate your work. But be sure that methods
don't overtake your story. If you're working on
a method illogical advance. So maybe your project is about
pushing the envelope on your methods, then Yeah, methods are the story. But if you're trying to work
on some kind of forecasting or to dig into some kind of domain, you're
working on an application of data science. The methods are not usually the story. You have to talk about your methods so
that I roughly know you know what you did and you want to point to your code so
that I can go replicated if I want to. But the methods are not themselves what
you want the readers to take home. You wanted them to understand
what your methods revealed and what is the value of that new information. So be sure that you provide hints and
resources links maybe even independence or a separate method section that's
kind of at the bottom of your blog. So that readers who are interested can
go into your work but make sure that those are not so overrepresented or
so dense in your writing, that we can't understand what
the conclusions and main ideas are. And finally lean into your voice and
don't be afraid to be opinionated. I think that there's a stage of
maturity that a lot of people reach as scientists where they start having
opinions, they start saying no, I don't think that that's
a valid analysis here. I know somebody else did this, but
I don't think that it really answered this question or I think this is the right
way to do this when you get to that. I think it's quite good to lean
into that state your opinions. It's okay to say things
that people disagree with. It's okay to say things that you know,
you think are even speculative, just just say it's a speculation. And it's okay for you to say this
is what I think the priority and this problem is not this. So have your opinions, explain them. I mean a lot of this, a lot of data
science is more of a craft than a science and it's okay and
even quite beneficial to you to own and start to cultivate an identity
around your priorities and interests as a data scientist. So I would love it if when
you write it sounds like you. So sure go out and read a lot of blogs and
writers in the data science and machine learning space. But also find your own voice. And one more thing I'll say about
that is that your voice does not have to be a certain character or
a certain flavor. Like there's a lot of room under
the umbrella of professional data science. For people who are funny or
quirky people who are really dry. You know, you don't have to force
your voice into any sort of category. There's there's really enough room for
all of those. So I hope that, you'll go into
something that feels like you and if you find yourself
covering up your voice or doing a lot of editing, try just,
this is something I do. Sometimes when I think I'm kind of editing
over editing or getting away from what I really mean is I will sometimes
just try saying something allowed. I'll say, what do I mean to say here? And I'll say something like, you know,
I tried this thing and it didn't work. So I gave up and I use this model
instead and I got a much better result. And then it's like, okay,
well that's what I'm going to write today. Just say the thing out loud that you mean
to say and write exactly what you say, and don't worry about if it's too simple, doesn't sound technical enough,
it usually is fine. So these are just some
of the tips that I have, there's obviously a lot that goes into
being, you know, a great communicator. But I really hope that this
gives you here in this course, a chance to try to find your voice as
someone who presents your work and be your own advocate for
the value of your work.
