Hi and welcome to the Master of Applied
Data Science Course and Causal Inference. I'm Alain Cohn, an Assistant Professor
at Michigan School of Information. In this course, we are going to tackle questions like does
health insurance make people healthier? Is it worth sending your
kids to a private school? Or should a business raise or
lower its prices to increase revenue? You will learn how to answer questions
like these in a convincing manner. These questions are causal in nature. That is, they ask whether something
causes something else to change. But why is it important to understand
the link between cause and effect? Well, anytime we make a decision
whether it's in business or in our personal lives, we are making
assumptions about how the world operates. That is, we make assumptions about
how actions lead to certain outcomes. Very often these are simple actions. For example, if you hit the snooze
button on your alarm clock, then the alarm will stop. If you hadn't hit the snooze button,
then the alarm would have kept ringing. So, by hitting the snooze button,
you caused the alarm to stop. In this example, it's relatively
easy to learn about causality because when you do something
you get immediate feedback. And through repetition, you gain
confidence that the one thing you do, causes the other thing to change. But sometimes actions are more complex, or we have to wait longer
to observe the outcome. For example, if you drink three
cups of coffee every morning, does it mean that you will develop
health issues when you're old? In those situations, it is much
harder to identify cause and effect. Because, A, you have to wait
longer to see the results. And, B, there may be other factors or decisions you make that
could affect the outcome. So, how can we find out whether
a relationship is indeed causal? The arguably best way to learn
about causality is to run a randomized experiment. That is, you randomly assign
people to one of two groups, and then you change what you're interested in,
in one group, but not in the other. The problem is,
that we cannot always run experiments. Sometimes it's too costly
to run an experiment, and other times it's just not feasible for
some reason. For example, it's probably not
a good idea to force people to drink 3 cups of coffee every morning and
then to wait 50 years to see what happens. So, we often have to work with
observational data, that is, data where we do not have full control over whether
people take a certain action or not. We simply observe whether
people took that action. So, what can we do in those situations? During this course you will learn
about five strategies to identify causal effects in observational data. This includes, matching, controlled
regression, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and
differences in differences. We will talk about the core
ideas behind those methods, their underlying assumptions, and what
kind of causal effect they're estimating? We will also study some examples, and
do some number crunching ourselves. So, I hope you will enjoy this course.
