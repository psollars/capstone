In this video, we're going to take a closer look
at the problem of selection bias. Selection bias arises when there is
a lack of comparability between two groups that are being compared. It refers to the fact that people can
often choose which action to take, say whether or
not to get health insurance. The insured may differ
from the uninsured for reasons other than
health insurance per se. So as mentioned in the previous video,
this is the most serious problem that methods of causal inference
are trying to solve. So let's go back to the question of
whether health insurance causes better health. This question is central to the debate
on whether the US should adopt some version of universal healthcare. The US is the only rich country
without universal healthcare. Obamacare, which was
introduced back in 2010, is the closest to a universal health
system that the US has ever implemented. It requires citizens to buy health
insurance with a tax penalty for those who don't. The tax penalties were designed to
make insurance more affordable for low income people, however,
in 2019 those tax penalties were removed. Today there are still about 30 million
Americans without health insurance. The uninsured can use the emergency
room as their primary care physician, but emergency department's are not
required to provide long-term care. Moreover, Services are expensive, and some of the costs are passed
on to the taxpayer. So it's clearly an important
question whether health insurance has a positive
effect on people's health. In this context, the fundamental
problem of causal inference is that we cannot observe a person both with and without health insurance
at the same moment in time. As a result, we cannot calculate the causal effect of
health insurance on a person's health. We have to make do with the health
outcomes that we observe, since that is all we got. So what if we compare the average
health status of the insured with that of the uninsured? Is this an all else equal, that is,
ceteris paribus comparison? Let's look at some data. In 2009, the National Health
Interview Survey collected data on the health insurance
status of married couples. Respondents were asked to report their
health status on a five-point scale ranging from one equals poor health
to five equals excellent health. The couples were also asked
whether they are insured or not. Now, as shown in this table, we observed differences in health
between the insured and uninsured. For men, the difference is
about 0.3 in the health index, and for women it's almost 0.4. These are relatively large differences
when measured against the standard deviation of the health index,
which is about one. But is this naive comparison of
the insured and uninsured ceteris paribus? In other words, is this an apples to
apples and oranges to oranges comparison? A simple comparison of
respondents with and without health insurance is
probably not other things equal. This table shows that there are important
differences between the two groups. For example,
the insured are more highly educated, with a schooling gap
of nearly three years. The insured are also more
likely to have a job. The difference in the share of people who
are employed is 7 percentage points for men and 21 percentage points for women. So these differences in education and employment can bias our estimate
of the average causal effect, because more educated people tend
to be healthier to begin with. They exercise more, they smoke less, and they're more likely to
wear seatbelts on average. Moreover, the fact that we see large
differences in observed variables should worry us that there might also be
differences in unobserved variables. So what exactly are we measuring
when we compare the average health status of the insured and
uninsured? To fixate this,
we first need to determine the notation. Our population of interests are all
people who can in principle obtain health insurance. Thus, the unit of observation
are individuals i. Our goal is to estimate the average. Causal effect for the full population, yet we only observe a sample of
the population, say a few thousand people. Thus we will have to apply
statistical inference, which we will come back
to in the next video. There are two main variables,
the first is the outcome variable. In our case, the outcome is a person's
health on a scale from 1 to 5. The second variable is the treatment
variable, this is what we want to change. Here it's whether or
not the person has health insurance, so it's a binary variable. Note that a lot of the language that
we will use comes from the medical literature, such as treatment and
control group. This is because our mental model
are randomized controlled experiments, which revolutionized the medical
sciences in the 50s. Now we may also have data
on other characteristics, such as a person's gender,
education, and income. These variables are called covariates, and they describe individuals
before they receive treatment. So the causal question is
whether D affects Y, and in our case it's weather health
insurance has a causal impact on health. A general framework for thinking about
causation is the potential outcomes model, also known as the Neymanâ€“Rubin
causal model. In this framework, a causal effect is defined as a comparison
between two potential states of the world. In the first state, a person gets
health insurance that is D = 1, and then later she reports her health status. The person's health status in this
state of the world is her potential outcome under the treatment condition,
so it's Y1. In the second state of the world, the same
person doesn't get health insurance, that is D = 0, and
then she reports her health status. So the person's health
status under the control condition is her potential outcome Y0. So each person has two potential outcomes,
Y1 and Y0. One potential outcome corresponds
to the actual or realized outcome, and the other potential outcome
represents the counterfactual outcome. The dilemma is that we can only
observe one potential outcome, either the person gets health insurance or
she doesn't. Thus, the counterfactual outcome is
the outcome that we don't observe, but we can imagine and work with it. The key idea of the potential
outcomes model is that the causal effect of the treatment,
say health insurance, is the difference in potential outcomes,
Y1- Y0. Now here's something
important to keep in mind, potential outcomes are distinct
from actual outcomes. Potential outcomes
are hypothetical random variables. On the other hand, observable outcomes
are factual random variables. To highlight the distinction, we denote
potential outcomes by superscripts, 1 and 0,
depending on the state of the world. Since we observed one state of the world,
we can link potential outcomes to actual outcomes using
the so-called switching equation. So the outcome Y = DY1 + (1- D)Y0. Because D is either 1 or 0, one of the two terms
on the right hand side of the switching equation will be 0. So Y equals Y1 for
individuals who are treated, and Y equals Y0 for
individuals who are not treated. Now we can rearrange terms
on the right hand side, to see that the actual outcome equals
to the potential outcome under the control condition plus the difference
in potential outcomes times D. The difference in potential outcomes is
the treatment effect, defined as tau. It gets added to the potential outcome
under the control condition if D equals 1, that is,
if the person received the treatment. Whenever we work with models, it's important to know
the underlying assumptions. Now a key assumption of the potential
outcomes model is the stable unit treatment value assumption,
otherwise known as SUTVA. This assumption has two main components. First, we assume that there is
no interference between units. This means that the effect of having
health insurance is not affected by whether others have health insurance. In reality, this may be violated though. For example, one could imagine that
the quality of medical services depends on how many other
patients a doctor has to treat. But we need this assumption to write an
individual's potential outcome solely in terms of that individual's
treatment assignment. The second part is that there is
only one version of the treatment. If there are multiple
versions of the treatment, it becomes difficult to understand
what the treatment effect means. Imagine some people get a light
version of health insurance, whereas others get full coverage, but
we don't really know who gets what. Then it would be unclear what
effect we're actually measuring. To get a better understanding
of the potential outcomes model, consider the following example
from the mastering metrics books. So we have two students, Khuzdar is a visiting Student who
recently arrived from Kazakhstan. While Kazakhstan has a National Health
insurance system that covers all its citizens automatically, in the US
Khuzdar has to decide whether to opt in to the university's health plan or not. Now Khuzdar decided to take
up UM's health insurance. Maria is also coming to
This year from Chile. She doesn't think she will get sick,
and so she decides not to get health insurance
and use the money for traveling. Now in this table you can see the actual
and potential outcomes for Khuzdar and Maria, as well as their
treatment assignment. So let's start with Khuzdar, Khuzdar
has health insurance, so D equals 1. According to the switching equation,
Khuzdar's observed health outcome, which is 4, equals his potential
health outcome under treatment. Likewise, Maria doesn't have health
insurance, so for her D equals 0. Maria's observed health outcome,
which is 5, equals her potential
outcome under control. Now you can see that the individual
treatment effect is not the same for Khuzdar and Maria. Turns out that they probably
made the right choice. Khuzdar decided to get health insurance,
and he benefits from it,
as his health increases by 1. So for him, the question is whether
he's willing to pay the price for insurance to improve his health. Maria didn't get health insurance,
but she also doesn't benefit from it. So her potential outcomes are the same
with and without insurance. But remember that in the real world
we never observe the counterfactuals, so it is impossible to calculate
individual treatment effects. This is the fundamental
problem of causal inference. Even learning about the distribution of
individual treatment effects, that is, whether most people have a positive or
negative causal effect, is often too difficult and
requires additional assumptions. Khuzdar and
Maria offer an interesting comparison, because they made different
insurance choices. So let's compute the difference in actual
outcomes between Khuzdar and Maria. Khuzdar's observed health status is 4, whereas Maria's observed
health status is 5. So the difference in health
between the two students is -1. In other words, a naive comparison of
Khuzdar, who has health insurance, and Maria, who doesn't, suggests that health
insurance is detrimental to one's health. Now our intuition tells us that
this result is probably wrong, but what exactly went wrong here? To find out, we need to carefully examine
what we're measuring when we compute the simple difference in actual outcomes. So the first thing to do is to link actual
to potential outcomes using the switching equation. Khuzdar's actual outcome equals to his
potential outcome if he gets health insurance. Maria's observed outcome is her potential
outcome if she doesn't get insurance. Now let's do a little math trick,
and simultaneously add and subtract Khuzdar's potential
outcome under no insurance. We can do this,
because the two terms add up to zero. So what happens is that we get
the individual causal effect for Khuzdar, which is Y1K- Y0K. And the difference in potential outcomes
under no insurance between the two students. So the second term is the selection bias,
it's the difference. Health status between Khuzdar and Maria,
if they both don't get insurance. In other words, this tells us how
Khuzdar and Maria differ on that exact same conditions,
namely without health insurance. So, naive comparison of Khuzdar and
Maria health, gives us two things, a causal effect, which is what we want,
and the selection bias. Now perhaps the problem of
selection bias has something to do with our focus on particular
individuals rather than groups. It could be that this individual
differences average out when we examine large groups of people. So our attention shifts now
to average causal effects. In a group of N people, the average
treatment effect is defined as the sum of individual treatment effects
divided by the number of individuals. As you can see, this is the same
as subtracting the average value of the potential outcomes. So Y0, from the average value
of the potential outcomes Y1. So the average treatment
effect of health insurance, compares average health in
hypothetical scenarios, where everybody in the group does and
does not receive health insurance. Notice that just like the individual
treatment effect, the average treatment effect is not a quantity that we can
calculate with any data set known to man. This is because it requires
two observations per person, one of which is the counterfactual
outcome, which cannot be observed. But maybe we can still get some useful
estimate of the average treatment effect with observable health outcomes,
since that's all we got. To simplify the notation,
we can write AVG subscript n, to describe averages instead
of using the summation symbol. So here you small n for
the number of people, because we are looking at the sample
rather than the full population. So the difference in group means,
is the average observed outcome among the insured minus the average
observed outcome among the uninsured. Now we can replace actual
outcomes with potential outcomes. The difference in group means is then
simply the average potential outcomes of the insured, if they get insurance
minus the average potential outcomes of the uninsured,
if they don't get insurance. So the difference in group means tells
us something about potential outcomes, but not necessarily what we want to know. We are after the average causal effect
involving everyones Y1 and everyones Y0. But instead,
we see the average Y1 only for the insured and
the average Y0 only for the uninsured? Now to better understand
what we have here, let's assume that everyone has
the same treatment effect. That is, health insurance makes everyone
how fair, but the same amount, Kappa. Using the constant effects assumption,
we can rewrite equations solely in terms of Kappa and the potential
outcomes under no insurance, that is Y0. The equation now reveals that naive
comparison of the insured and uninsured equals to the causal
effect of interest. Kappa plus the difference in
average potential outcomes Y0, between the insured and the uninsured? This second term describes
the selection bias. Y0 of person i,
is everything about that person that is related to health except for
health insurance. Thus selection bias,
doesn't go away when we compare groups. It's the non-insurance differences
between the insured and uninsured. So as we have seen at
the beginning of this video, the insured and
uninsured different important ways. For example, the insured, a better
educated and more likely to have a job. What we don't know is whether
they also differ in an observed characteristics such as
exercise eating habits. As we will see, if the only source of
selection bias are observed differences, then the problem of selection
bias is relatively easy to fix. However, if we find that they're
important, observed differences between group, chances are high that there
are also important unobserved differences. Because we don't know what is an observed
differences are either, because we can't measure them or simply because
we don't have the appropriate data, it's difficult to correct for,
Those unobserved differences. So, the main challenge of causal
inference is to eliminate selection bias, that arises from such unobserved
differences between groups.
