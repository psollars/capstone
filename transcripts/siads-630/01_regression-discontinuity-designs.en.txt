This video will introduce you to the
method of regression discontinuity design. Regression discontinuity has emerged as
one of the most credible strategy for the analysis of causal effects
in observation settings. So let's start with a motivating example. Suppose you want to know the effect
of passing the MADS course on your future income. Randomly assigning some people
to that passing treatment, and let others fail is clearly unethical. So a randomized experiment
is out of question. Since several things are hard to measure
and possibly correlated with both passing the course and income, such as innate
ability or intrinsic motivation. We also know that controlled regression
won't solve the selection bias problem. Luckily, we have a passing cutoff
that creates a natural experiment. Students earning a grade of 70 or
above pass but those with a grade just
below don't pass the course. So here is the identification
strategy told in one picture. The probability of passing the course
jumps to one at the grade cutoff of 70. So a student who earns 69 points and thus
does not pass the course, is plausibly very similar to a student who earns
70 points and just passes the course. Now, this graph here shows how
the discontinuity in passing the course may affect the outcome
of this future earnings. We see a jump in earned income just
around the cutoff grade of 70. So if we have enough students in
some narrow band around the cutoff, we can use that discontinuity
in pass no pass to estimate the causal effect of
passing the course on income. We live in a world that is full of laws,
rules and regulations that have certain thresholds. For example, US citizens born in 1955, they get retirement benefits
at age 66 in two months. So it's not age 66 in three months or
age 66 in one month. It's exactly age 66 in two months. Another example is the earned
income tax credit. Working families get the refundable
tax credit if their income is below a certain threshold. As a further example,
think about politicians. So politicians typically win an election
if they receive one more vote than their competitors. So this creates a strong discontinuity. And the regression discontinuity
approach takes advantage of this arbitrary nature of such thresholds. People on one side of the threshold
are treated while those on the other side are not. Now it may seem contradictory that rules, which appear to eliminate randomness,
that these create valuable experiments. But this fixed rules also
create a certain randomness. For those near the threshold, it's basically random if they fall
just above or below the threshold. So people above and below the threshold
have similar characteristics. In other words, they're comparable:
ceteris paribus. So here's the basic RD setup. We call the variable that partly or wholly determines the treatment
assignment the running variable. Sometimes this variable is also
called the forcing variable, because it kind of forces
people to get treatment or not. So RD is all about finding jumps
in the probability of treatment as we move along the variable X. Intuitively, we are interested in
the discontinuity in the outcome at the discontinuity in
the treatment assignment. We therefore need that
potential outcomes and the running variable have a continuous or
smooth relationship around the cutoff. Otherwise, we don't know whether the
change in the outcome is due to a change in treatment status or
a change in the running variable. The validity of an RD design doesn't
require that the assignment rule is arbitrary. It only requires that the rule is known,
precise and free of manipulation. If that's the case, then changes in
the outcome around the threshold can be interpreted as causal effect. And attractive feature of RD is that
both the identification strategy and the main causal effect can both
be described in a single graph. A drawback of RD designs is
that they require lots of data around the discontinuities
because that is the data we're going to use to identify causal effects. There are basically two
types of RD designs. Their designs were the probability of
treatment goes from zero to one at the cutoff. Just like in the motivating example about
the effect of passing MAD scores on earned income, all individuals with the running variable
above the cutoff received the treatment. And those below don't. This is called a sharp RD design. Then there are designs where the
probability of treatment increases this continuously at the cutoff. In this case, we allow for
smaller jumps in treatment assignment. For example reaching a certain threshold
may encourage participation in the program, but it doesn't actually
force people to participate. This is called a fuzzy RD design. In the next video, we will take
a closer look at sharp RD designs.
