So our case study for this particular segment
is some wearables data. Now, you remember that I
was wearing a couple of different wearable devices on that biking segment that
we covered earlier. In that particular case, I was collecting a
couple of data files. We'll call them write.csv
or write2018.csv, or we might use write
2019.csv in some of our work. But that wearables data in
a format called FIT or FIT, and it can be a little
bit unwieldy when it comes to taking a
look at the data compared to what we're
used to in CSV files. So it's a great case
study for us to explore some of the Linux command line interface
functionality.
