The Linux shell is a program that allows a user to interact
with the operating system. So the Linux shell allows you to operate with the Linux OS. So Linux consists
of a whole bunch of different infrastructure
that runs the machines. So on par with Mac and
Windows, you have Linux. The Linux Shell
then allows you to interact with that
operating system. The Linux shell contains built-in commands as well as
runnable external commands. The shell will start running when you open a
console or terminal, and what's interesting is
you can run multiple shells. You don't have to
run just one shell, so you can have multiple shells running and open
at the same time. There are in addition
to the ability to have multiple shells
running simultaneously, you can use different
flavors of shell. We'll be using one called "bash", other ones that you
may hear about are just plain SH or
the Bourne shell, CSH, TCSH, KSH, and ZSH
are the common ones. But again, in this
course we're going to be focused primarily
on using "bash". In the Jupyter environment that you're using in this program, you can start the Linux shell by going over to the
new drop-down menu, and you're probably
familiar with saying new Python 3 notebook. We're going to do
something a little bit different in this
segment of the course, we're going to ask
for a new terminal. When you start a new terminal, you'll see this appear. So a black screen
typically with white text, and you will have something called a Linux command prompt. The bash shell prompt or
Linux command prompt, looks similar to the following. On the left-hand
side of the at sign, you'll have a Linux username. In MADS that's always
going to be Jovyan. It's the way that we set up the containers for you
to use Jupyter in. The next piece of the
shell is the at sign. That separates the Linux
username from the host name. In this particular case, the host name is just
Jupyter followed by a dash, followed by your uniqname. So every time you spin up a machine in MADS by logging in, you actually run
your own machine, and that host's name is
Jupyter dash, your uniqname. The next part of the
bash shell prompt is a colon which separates all of that information of
username at host name, from an indication of your
current working directory, and we're going to
dive into what that means in just a few minutes. The next piece is a dollar sign. That's the traditional marker for the end of a
Linux shell prompt. So after that, is where
you'll see a white square. It might be flashing depending
on your particular setup, and that's the actual
prompt itself. So again, we have
the Linux username, always Jovyan in this case, at the host name of the
machine in this case, Jupyter dash uniqname
followed by a colon, followed by the current
working directory terminated by a dollar sign, and that's ready
for you to type in.
