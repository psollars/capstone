I want go over some basic
command line editing tools, and you might want to
refer back to this as we get going with some of
the interactive materials. Whenever you see a caret in
this particular segment, that's this character here, that means to hold down the Control key and type
the following character. For example, caret L means to hold down the Control
key and type the L key. So that's consistent
across Mac and Windows. So by Control, I really mean the Control key and
not the Command key. There are a series of command
line editing shortcuts that I'd like you to
become familiar with. That first one I just
mentioned, Control L, will clear the screen, and that's useful for
cleaning things up. We'll go over things like
UpArrow and DownArrow which makes it easier to recall
recently used commands. We'll talk about
erasing the lines. Sometimes you mess up
and you want to erase. We want to quickly
be able to scoot or move to the beginning
or end of the line. We might want to do something
a little bit more powerful, and that is to go
through our history and search for a
recently used command. Finally, and I like
to always say this, data scientists tend to be on the lazy side of things and
we don't like to type a lot. So the Tab key will do things
called autocompleting, and autocompleting will take a best guess at what
you're trying to indicate. So for example, if you're
typing a command and hit Tab, it'll try to autocomplete
that command. If you're typing a
filename and hit Tab, it will also try to
complete that filename. The last command line
editing shortcut that I want to tell you
about is Control C, which will stop running
the current command. So let's start out with
clearing the screen. As I mentioned, it's Control L. It's useful to
declutter your display. So as you get going, you see a lot of
stuff on your screen, you might want to just say, "Hey, I need to just
clear this out. I need to take a
break from the stuff. I need to start over." Clear will clear
that screen for you. It won't erase
anything of your data, it'll just clear the screen. If you prefer, you can
use the clear command. You can type clear
and hit Return. Again, little bit
on the lazy side, we're going to use Control L because that takes
fewer keystrokes. I'm going to go
through a couple of more commands before we turn our attention to that interactive prompt
that we just brought up. The UpArrow and
DownArrow commands allow you to scroll
through previous commands. They're useful if you
want to go back to your command history and
re-run a previous command. It's also useful if
you want to recall a previous command and then edit it before re-running them. Sometimes when you're
editing the command line, you'll want to get rid
of the rest of the line. You can use Control U to
eliminate the rest of the line. So typically you'll backup, do some editing and then erase
it to the end of the line. Going to the beginning of a
long command line, of course, you can do with using your left arrow key
and holding it down, and that can get cumbersome
if you're going back for 50, 60, 80 different characters. So Control A will jump right to the
beginning of that line. Control E will similarly
jump to the end of the line. So you can remember that because Control A is the beginning
of the alphabet, Control E is the end of the line. You can't use Control Z
because that means something else in the Linux command
line environment. One of the more
powerful things you can do is a reverse search. This is similar to the UpArrow key where you're
going through your history, but you can selectively retrieve a previous
command line by entering some sequence of characters that you used before, and then pressing Control R to search for those characters. We'll go over how that works as we get going on
the command line. One of the things I
mentioned that's really useful is the Tab key. Tab provides a smart completion of whatever you're typing. You can complete commands, filenames, names of
directories, and so on. The robustness of this smartness depends on the choice of show. Dash does a pretty good job
of trying to figure out if you're trying to enter
a command or a filename, and generally does
the right thing. So let's go ahead and get started with some of
our show commands, and we're going to start out with a very simple one called echo. Echo will print
something to the screen. For example, in the
next two lines there you see echo "Hello, MADS world," and echo
"It's a MADS, MADS world." So let's try those out
and see what happens. Here we are at our Linux
command line prompt, and let's try that echo command. So let's type echo
"Hello, MADS world." So this is a little
under impressive, but you get the idea
that it will echo to your screen whatever
you type there. We could, for example,
from the slides, do echo "Hello MADS, MADS world again! " So we have two echo
commands there. I want to also show you some of the shortcuts that we talked
about just a minute ago. So what we can do is hit the UpArrow key and that will retrieve
the previous command. So I could go back
and edit this to say, "Hi MADS, MADS world." Let's say I want to jump
to the end of the line and change that exclamation
mark to a period. I did Control E to
jump to the end. Let's do that again. I was here, I hit Control E, jump to the end, use my left arrow key, delete key, and
change that to a dot. So that's some of the examples of how we can use
those shortcuts. Again, that echo command
simply prints to the screen that which
we put in the quotes. I mentioned that the
Control R command will selectively
match the history. So instead of just going
up through my commands, I'm going up and down right now. Up, up, up, down, down, down. If I knew that somewhere in my history I used the word "Hi", I could hit Control R and you'll notice that my prompt
has now changed from my usual
jovyan@jupyter-uniquename;~$ to, in parenthesis, reverse-i-search, so that means reverse
incremental search. So if I look for "Hi", you'll see what I
typed is indicated in the quotes sequence right beside reverse-i-search right over here, and that's pulled up that HI in my most recent
echo command. So that's a quick
way of retrieving some previous command that matches a sequence of characters in which
you're interested. Now in this case, I simply
could have used this cursor UpArrow because that was
my most recent command, but you can imagine how you've entered a bunch of
these commands and you want to return to
something that you remember some of
the sequences from. So again, going to Control
E to go to the end of the line and I can hit Return
just to run that again. I'm going to show
you one more thing and that is to go here. I want to truncate that line. I can hit Control U, which will delete
the beginning part, and then hit echo,
"MADS world again." So Control U deletes from where I am to the
beginning of the line. So that's a very quick
introduction to some of the keystrokes that can help us with using the
Linux command line, and we introduced a very
simple command called echo. In the next segment, we'll take a look at
the Linux file system and get moving with some of the data manipulation
commands as well.
