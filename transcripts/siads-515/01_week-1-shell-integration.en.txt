Now I've talked really
quickly about piping, more generally that's
called shell redirection. Our output from
commands can be sent to a file or to another command. We can use the
greater than sign to send the output of
a command to a file or we can use the pipe to send the output of the
command to another command. So for example, we
can take a look at the first few lines of a file using the head command
that we covered, and send that to another
file called first few lines of text, firstfewlines.txt. Similarly, we can send the output of one command,
in this case, head file.txt, to the grep command hence
search for the word data. We can link all these
three together. So for example, taking
the first few lines of file.txt using
the head command, piping it to grep
for the word data, and sending it to a file called
few underscore data.txt. Those are a bunch of examples of commands that can help us
with data manipulation. In the next segment, we're
going take a look at how to integrate all that with
the Jupiter environment.
