Hi, we're back in the studio now and
welcome to week one of size 515. This week, we're going to be talking
about the Linux command line interface. As an overview of this week, I want to talk about why we're
not going to use Python. We're going to talk really
quickly about that case study of collecting wearable data. We're going to talk about the Linux shell,
command-line editing. We're going to go over
some filesystem basics. We're going to talk about different
ways to view and edit files. And we're going to do a little bit of
data manipulation with sorting and filtering and we're going to close
up this week talking about how all the shell commands
are integrated with Jupyter. So one thing you might want to ask
is why aren't we using python? In the rest of the program,
we're really focused on Python. This is perhaps the one week
departure from that paradigm. So it turns out that sometimes Python is
not the best choice for data processing. Python scripts may not be great for
super quick data manipulation. I mean we know Python is good for
data manipulation in general, and at this point you can probably write
a Python script pretty quickly. But sometimes you can go even faster
by using the command line interface. You can often use just one or two lines of Linux commands to accomplish
what would take many lines of Python. So there are some particular tools that
we're going to focus on that can really shorten the amount of code that you write. In other words, and this is where we tie
back into efficient data processing, Python might not always be
the most efficient choice.
