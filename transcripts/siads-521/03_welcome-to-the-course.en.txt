Hi, welcome to the visual
exploration of data class. So I'm Chris Brooks here, assistant professor at the University
of Michigan School of Information. >> I'm Nia Dowell. I was a post doc when we were filming
this but I'm an assistant professor in the School of Education at
the University of California Irvine. >> Yeah, so this class is
actually a lot of fun for me. I really enjoy the methods that
we're going to be talking about. There's a little bit
of everything in here. So there's data preparation,
data manipulation. So you'll see pandas again. There's information, visualization,
so you'll see charting and exploration of data, but there's also
some statistics that underlies this. And there's a lot of different tools
that we use when we're doing this. One of my goals with this class is
actually to share with you how we use it in our actual research. So how we're using these tools to
explore our own data to drive our actual decisions. So Nia, you do a lot of research
in learning analytics and you use a lot of these kinds of tools. So did you want to share
something about that? >> Yeah, so I primarily use R when I'm
exploring different types of data and projects. And I look at scatter plots and
bar graphs and tons of other visualizations to really
understand what the data is telling me. What have we found? >> Yeah, and I think that that's something
that I think is really interesting about this class and a real challenge for
us in this class. So as you know in this degree path, we're
using Python from one end to the other. And in David Donoho's 50 years of Data
Science paper, which I think is excellent, and I'm going to encourage you to read. He talks about the importance for
data science tests to be polymaths. That is to be able to use the kinds
of tools that they need to to get the job done. To be able to use things like R and
Python and so forth. >> Be flexible. >> Yeah, exactly. And in this class we're going to use
Python and we're going to show you a bunch of different tools that you can use in
Python to do visual exploration of data, but I'll be honest. I think it's a huge weak
point in Python's ecosystem. There's lots of variety. That's nice. There's diversity. But R and GG Plot and GG Animator. >> Is very powerful. >> Yeah, these are really actually
very solid tools for exploring data. So why don't we look at a couple of
the visualizations that we've worked on together? >> Sounds great. Yeah so this is actually a visualization
from a paper that I have in behavioral research methods. And what we're seeing here
is a cluster analysis and the results from that where we found
six different clusters of profiles of how individuals were interacting across
six different linguistic dimensions. And cluster analysis is not something
that we get into in this course but we will discuss that later
in subsequent courses. >> Yeah I think that it's especially
in the unsupervised machine learning is where you'll talk a lot about clustering
and finding the centroids and you can see some obvious trends just
by glancing at this kind of analysis. So you can see that this cluster for instance is very different
from this cluster. And so even just a simple chart like this,
which you probably learned in grade school is something that we use in EDA to try and
understand some of our data. >> Yeah yeah. So this is actually by plot. Another thing that we didn't talk about
is principal component analysis in this course, but again,
we'll talk about that later. And what we're looking at is a really
powerful way to understand the patterns in the data. So for
instance in this particular project, we had two experimental conditions of
control and intervention condition. That's yellow and blue. And you can also see that the size
of the actual bubbles is telling you the importance of that measure. And then I don't know if you can see but
each one of these arrows also is telling you the length of the arrow is how
powerful that particular linguistic dimension is contributing
to that dimension. >> And I think that this is
an interesting exploration piece and we'll put up the paper to link to this. But what I think is really interesting is
how much information is actually encoded in this what looks like a scatter plot. So first it's broken up into quartiles so
that you can see kind of and that's the by plot part
how it's distinguished. The color lets you know these
different conditions and so you can see clearly there's more
blue here and more yellow over here. You have node size, which has been
varied to show different aspects. And then these arrows that are labeled. And at the end of this now we don't talk
about by plots in this course directly, although there is an assignment at the end
to expand this course basically where the students are going to actually
introduce new plots to us. But at the end of this course you should
actually have the knowledge of how to create this kind of graphic
using the Python tools. >> And
see very distinct patterns in your groups. >> Yeah, so this is some work that we
did together with student Jing and this is a more traditional scatter plot. And so
you see that we have four subplots here. And each one is showing a different year. This is actually looking at some of
the MOOC data that we've collected over the years. And so what we did was we plotted
the human development index. So you can think of that like rich or
affluent countries towards the right and poor or less affluent
countries towards the left and then looked at their passing rates. And so we looked at 2012,
2013, 14, and 15. And so we were really interested do
a students from lower socioeconomic status countries, do they have a lower rate of
passing courses in gaining certification? >> And how does that change over time? >> Right exactly an important piece here. And so one of the nice features here is
that not only do we have the individual plots for all of the different courses and
countries that we looked at. But we have these regression lines
with error bars around them and we can see that that actually flattens
quite a bit over time meaning that there's less of a difference
between these two groups. The more affluent and the less affluent. But we also see that the bar lowers over
time to which means more fewer people just in general are passing. Some of the things that you'll learn
in this course to control created these kinds of plots. There's some subtle things like being
able to lock axis between your subplots, being able to plot lines and
little bubble markers. And then if you've taken the course on HCI that we're offered right
before this class. You may notice some of the tough D aspects
as well lowering your data ink ratio for instance. >> Right.
We're increasing it. This last one is actually work that I
did in collaboration with Ryan Baker and actually the student who did it was
Josh Gardner who's now a PhD student at the University of Washington. And so this is just a nice curve. This is actually from
machine learning as well. So here we're plotting the false positive
rate versus the true positive rate, which gives us a sort of sense
of accuracy or error for these kinds of machine learning models. And if we had a nice diagonal line,
that would be a perfect or sorry that would be perfectly chance. And what we really want are models to be
up like this in this quadrant, which means they're really predictive and they
don't make errors in either direction. >> I think this is a very powerful figure. >> Yeah, and you'll see a lot of
these they're called ROC plots or AUC depending on what
you're looking at exactly. But you'll see a lot of these and what we've done here is actually plotted
two different models against one another. What we actually did
it's the same model but we're comparing the models performance for
men and women. And this is a learning
analytics model in MOOCs, and we wanted to see is there a bias
in the model between those two. Actually in this work we're introducing
a new metric for bias called a broca, but you could see the shaded area between and
you actually learn that in some of the first lectures in this
course how to look at that. And it really pops out and let's you see. That's the kind of error over all
the parameterizations of my models and then you can see there's some markers
here where the models actually crossed so the error changes for different groups. And then you can see
the annotations throughout and so these are all techniques that you're
going to learn in this course. So welcome to this visual
exploration of data course. We took a little bit of
a different approach with this. Instead of just lectures and just notebooks we're trying to demonstrate
some of the more applied aspects of this. >> Exactly.
>> To give you a little confidence that you can use this in your work. There are a couple of readings
associated with this course. So one the textbook for the course is all
about the mechanics of matplotlib and how to use this one tool. I think it's a good book for
referencing matplotlib, but a lot of people want extra
support with statistics. This course is not a stats heavy course,
but there's a wonderful free chapter
that's being given as well that goes through some of these techniques
as far as statistics goes. So I think the biggest challenge we had
in coming up with this course is how to distill down the number of different
visual exploration methods. We wanted to show you that
they were still relevant. That they were not highly specialized,
but that we could cover in a reasonable amount of time given
that it's just a four-week course. So hopefully we've done a good job of. >> Yeah, and we've definitely tried to
ground this all in applied application so you can actually see how you would
use this in your own research. >> Yeah so hopefully you will enjoy the
supplementary readings that we've peppered in throughout the course
of our research and other people's research to see how these
visual methods are actually being used and we'll see you on slacker in
the other discussion forum. >> Welcome.
