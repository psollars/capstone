Hello, this is Qiaozhu Mei
from School of Information. Today we will talk about
the functionalities of data mining. As we discussed, there are four
dimensions of a data mining task. These include the data to be mined,
the knowledge to be discovered, techniques that connects
the input to output, and applications where
this process will be used. And the knowledge to be discovered is
the output of a date mining process, it is also known as data
mining functionalities. There are many possible knowledge you can
discover from a data mining process or there are many different
data mining functionalities. We will talk about a few today. We will talk about online analytical
processing, abbreviated as OLAP. We'll talk about associations,
classification, predictions, clustering,
ranking, and outlier detection. For these functionalities, we will
briefly talk about their definition, the techniques people use to implement,
and the basic applications of them. Now let's look at them one by one. Let's first look at online
analytical processing. The goal of this functionality
is to provide fast answering of multidimensional analytical queries. And here note that analytical process is
different from transactional process. Let me tell you about a particular,
typical transactional database. This database is very common
in business practices. Whenever there's a transaction,
we add the entry into this database. So you can see that in every entry,
it will tell you at what time, what product has been purchased
by whom at what quantity. This is known as
the transactional database. And it is easy to query particular
instances of transactions. You can also answer aggregated queries,
such as how many TVs were sold in total? Right, you just need to
write simple SQL statement. However, if your manager ask you a more
complicated question, let's see, how many TVs were sold in the second
quarter of 2011 in North America? Your job is much harder. Because it's a lot harder to query this
database to find out which transactions have taken place in the second
quarter of the year and which countries are actually
in North America. You can see that transactional databases
are not very suitable to answer these analytical queries. And that's why we need to provide
functionality called OLAP. Online analytical
processing uses techniques, including data warehouses and data cubing. The data warehouse is the infrastructure
that integrates multiple types of transactional data, processes them, and
makes them available for future analysis. Data cubing is a technique
on top of data warehouse. The goal of which is to
pre-aggregate transactional data and make them ready for future queries. The objective of data cubing is to
improve the efficiency of this analysis. So you can see that in the following
example, transactional data are integrated based on either
geographic locations or time ranges. Although the actual query won't be
about the exact date or region. Once the data has been pre-aggregated,
you just need to aggregate a few cubes to get
the results of the query that you want. OLAP has been a major techniques
used in business intelligence where you need to handle large
amount of transactional data and you need to answer lots
of aggregated queries. The second functionality we will
talk about today is association. The goal of this functionality is
to find inherent regularities and relations in large amount of data. Let's see the simple example. Suppose you have five
transactions over here. In every transaction,
you can see a set of items. You can see that there
are lots of blue circles, but there are also golden triangles and
purple diamonds. Based on this database, you can discover
the relation between the items. For example, you can see that
the amount of times when you see the golden triangle,
you will see the following diamond. And you can also say that you're 80%
confident about this association. Associations are usually discovered
based on techniques of counting. People count the concurrences of items. And beyond that, people calculate
the correlations between data objects. And even beyond that, people try to
establish causality between the items. Associations of frequent patterns have
been applied to many different fields, for example, basket data analysis or
catalog design. In this example, if we know that lots of
customers bought these books together, you may want to bundle them and
advise them to your future customers. You may also find the best combination of
keywords that are associated with your search engine ads that will help you a lot
when you work with Google to optimize your queries and your advertisement. Associations have also been widely used
in search engine log analysis, for example, to recommend next query based
on the previous query given by the user.
