So these are how to describe
the concepts you're familiar with from instances
to sequence data, right? So association rules and frequent subsets. Now, let's look at some special cases
of sequential patterns that only apply to sequence data. One special case of sequential
pattern is known as N-grams. You may have heard about this term
if you have dealt with texting. N-gramps are sub sequences that are consecutive related
to the original sequence. Remember that in the sub sequence, all the items have to appear
in the original sequence. And if when they appear in the original
sequence, there are no gaps among them. Then it is called the N-gram. For example, suppose the original
sequence is to be or not to be, then we can extract
sequential patterns N-grams, right, where n equals to 1 2 3 or
4 and so on so forth. So we can extract one grams also known
as uni grams from this sequence and they are single items to, be, or, not. If we decide to extract 2-grams also known
as bigrams from the original sequence, you also obtained four of them,
to be, be or, or not, and not to. Similarly, the 3-grams or trigrams of this original
sequence contains to be or, be or not, or not be, and not to be. And the 4- grams of this
original sequence only contains three patterns instead of four, right? So you can see that N-rams is essentially
a special case of sequential pattern, right? They have lens n and
n is a natural number. When the appear in the original sequence,
they have to be consecutive. There cannot be gaps among them. So what if we do have
gaps in the subsequence? When there are gaps, when the subsequence
appear in the original sequence, the subsequence is known as skip-grams. Why, because when there are gaps, that means we have skipped certain
items in the original sequence. Again, let's look at example of such
sequential patterns from to be or not to be and
now let's use asterisk to indicate gaps. And if you see the star,
that means we have skipped zero or one or multiple items in the original sequence. Now the skip-bigrams of
this original sentence contains the patterns to * be,
to * or, to * not, or to * to. What does that mean? That means even skip-bigrams,
you also have only two items. And when the two items appearing
the original sentence, you have skipped a number of other items. For example, when the pattern
with a skip-bigram to * be appear in the original sequence, you can
see that you have either escaped no item. That means you're looking at
the first two items to be, or you have skipped four items, right? That means this pattern maps to the very
first item and the very last item, and the four items in between be or
not to were skipped right in this pattern. Similarly, we can extract skip-trigrams
from the original sequence and the following are all
skip-trigrams such as to be * not, to * or * to, and to * to * be, right? If you look at the pattern to be * not,
that indicates that when the three items appear in the original sequence,
we have skipped how many? We have skipped three items or
not to or, sorry, here made a mistake. We have only skipped one item to be and we skipped item or and
then we have another item not. Right, if you look at the pattern to * or
* to, when this pattern up here in the original
sequence, how many items have we skipped? We skipped the item be in between to and
or and we skipped another item between item or
and to, okay? So this is our technician
about skip-gramps. The difference between skip-grams and
N-grams is that when skip-grams appear in our original sequence,
you have skipped a number of items. That means this subsequences have gaps. So now, if you compare N-grams and
skip-grams, to just summarize, the N-gram are sub sequences
that are consecutive. And then n is the natural number that
indicates the lens of this pattern. If n = 1,
that means the subsequence have one item. N = 2, that means the subsequence has to
consecutive items, so on and so forth. And in skip-grams, we're looking
at subsequences that have gaps and the gap could be either zero or
one or many items. The number of skipped items
in a gap is arbitrary, right? Although, naturally, you think that in a
gap, you have skipped at least one items. But in the general definition,
you could have skipped only zero items. So that means, all the N-grams
are also special cases of skip-grams. So there are many different
types again skip-bigrams indicates the subsequences with gaps and
with exactly two items. Skip-trigrams meaning skip-grams
with three items so on and so forth. So in these examples, you can see
that you can skip an arbitrary number of items in the original sentence,
in the skip-gram, right? But sometimes,
we have a restriction that the skip-gram between any two items,
you can only skip at most K items. In that case,
the skip-gram is called K Skip-gram. So the K Skip-gram is a subsequence
which gaps skipping at most K items in the original sentence,
in the original sequence. For example,
given the example to be or not to be. If you look at K Skip-trigrams, I know
this is tricky, 2-Skip-trigrams meaning that you are looking at subsequences
of how the items of three items. And among the three items, you have skipped at most two items
in between any two of the items. So what has to skip-trigrams
of the original sequence? You have to star or not, right? This pattern has three items. So you start trigram. It's a skip-trigram, right? Because we have the gap between to and or. How many items have we
skipped in this gap? Right, we have skipped only one, right? So this pattern is the valid
2-skip-trigram, right? Similarly to * not * be is
also 2-skip-trigram, right? Because it has three items to not be there
gaps among them is in mu T any two items. We have skipped either one or
two items, right? So that's why it is the 2-skip-trigram. The horrible patterns like to * to be,
is that also a 2-skip-trigram? Well, it is a trigram for
sure because it has three items, right, and there are gaps between 2 and 2. But if you look at how many
items are skipped between 2 and 2, there are actually
is 3 that is above 2. So this item,
is this pattern is not 2-skip-trigram because you have skipped too
many items between 2 and 2. Similarly, the pattern to be * be, you have skipped more than two items
in between the two items be and be. So this is also not a 2-skip-trigram,
right? The other special cases
of sequential patterns, which you may have learned somewhere else. For example, prefix and suffix are two special cases of
sequential patterns of subsequences. A prefix is essentially a subsequence
that contains the first few items of a sequence. For example,
in the sequence of characters, right? The subsequence sub is actually a prefix of a longer term. And suffix is essentially a subsequence
that contains the last few items in a sequence. For example in the word priceless
which is a sequence of characters. The sub sequence L-E-S-S
is the suffix because it contains the last for words of this word.
