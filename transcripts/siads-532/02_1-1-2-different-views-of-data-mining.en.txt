So now we know the
definition of data mining. Let's look at a few related terms and how those concepts are
related to data mining. This thing about Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. They're not data mining, but they're related
because there are techniques people utilize
in data mining process. What about Database
Management Systems and Data Warehouses? These concepts are also
different from data mining. But they're related
because they are the systems that support
data mining process. What about the
broader concepts like Big Data Analytics
and Data Science? Apparently those two terms are broader than the
concept of data mining. But data mining can
be considered as the key component to
these broad fields. The goal of data mining again, is to discover knowledge
from the data. You may also have heard the
term Business Intelligence. This is also very much
related to data mining, as business intelligence is the particular application of data mining in the
field of business. Since you have heard about all these related
concepts you can see that people in different fields may have their own
view of data mining. For example, people
who work on databases may have a database view
of data mining where they define the mining as a
process and techniques that connects data warehouses to
the discovery of patterns. Let me look at an example. So in database systems, people build data
warehouses to integrate data from various
transactional databases. They clean the data,
they integrate the data, then make them
available for analysis. Then they select task relevant data from
the Data Warehouse, to enter the data mining process. The goal of which is to discover
patterns that may or may not be useful for decision-making
for business decisions. These patterns discovered
will be evaluated and those might not be decided to be
useful for business decisions, will be added back to
the Data Warehouse. This is how you generate knowledge that could
support decision support. Machine learning researchers may also have their own
view of data mining. In this case, data
mining is interpreted as particular techniques that
connects the input data, raw data to the output knowledge. Here the output knowledge
could be classification, could be predictions,
could be rankings. In this general process, you can see that there
are usually three steps. In the first step,
you need to integrate the raw data from different
sources of different types. You need to extract
features from this data. Usually, you need to normalize
the features extracted, and then select a smaller
set of useful features for your Machine Learning
process from the large pool of candidates. Sometimes, you also
need to reduce the dimensionality of the
features you extract. Once the data is preprocessed, the feature vectors
are generated. You can use machine learning algorithms to train your model. This could be based on supervised learning
where you have labels, unsupervised learning where
you don't have labels, semi-supervised learning
or reinforcement learning. Typically, when
people are talking about machine
learning algorithms, they are talking about this
model training process. After the models are trained, they will be evaluated in a
post-processing procedure. People will test the model using [inaudible] held-out data. They will select from
multiple candidate models. They will try to
interpret the model, present model results or visualize the model
results to real users. After this post-processing step, you can generate decision
support knowledge such as classification results, predictions or ranking results. Data mining is as broad
as the whole process that connects the raw data to the classification
prediction and ranking. Well machine learning
algorithms is the key component
in this process. It is also interesting to
look at the application view of data mining using business
intelligence as an example. In this view, data mining is the decision support process, that connects the low-level
data exploration components to the higher level
decision making processes. In the lower level, data are integrated from
different sources. They are preprocessed, they are put into
the data warehouse, and they are explored using
various statistical tools. Data mining takes
over and generate candidate knowledge
which may or may not be helpful for
decision support. Once data miners present
their results to the stakeholders or to
the business managers, they will evaluate the usefulness of the candidate patterns, and they will decide
which ones can help the business decisions
which ones cannot. Finally, the useful patterns, useful knowledge will be used
to make business decisions. In the Information School, we also have our own
view of data mining, which is the human-centered view. In this view, real
users are treated as the first-class citizen as the essential component
of a data mining process. We call this view a data
mining of the people, by the people, and
for the people. All the way from real users, we collect data about them. We deal with data they generated and through
the selection process, we do even detections, we characterize the data. We try to expand the phenomenon in the
user generated data. We try to make predictions. Through a whole data
mining process, real users can participate. We bring them into the loop, and we learn from there wisdom. Note that, in such that human
centered date mining view, the process does not end
with making predictions. Instead, we will move on to make use of the patterns
to construct experiments. To conduct interventions
through real people so that the people who
are generating the data, will also be the people who benefit from the whole process.
