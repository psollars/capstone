Another related, but very different data representation
is called Time Series Data. You're probably familiar
with time series already. Data object in a time series
could be a growth chart, the prices of a stock over time, or your battery life on
your smartphone over time. For example, in this
particular example, we are measuring the heights of the boy when he is two-years-old, three-years-old, four-years-old, five-years-old, so and so forth. Every attribute in a time
series is the measurement of one numerical property
observed at a given time point. This time point could be at
the granularity of year. Could be at the granularity
of seconds, so and so forth. In a mathematic formulation
of a time-series data, you can say that we're
dealing with the least of timestamped
measurements. Here similar to
the sequence data, the data object can be
composed into a set of pairs. Every pair you have x_i. But this time, x_i is the numerical measurement
of a property, for instance, the stock price. Instead of the order
or the position, every x_i is associated with the timestamp t_i that
indicates at what time, this measurement was taken. Sometimes when people don't care about the particular timesteps, you can also represent the time series data
as the function. The measurement of
the property of your data can be described
as the function of time. You can usually use
the so called curves to represent time series data. For example, on the left-hand
side of this slide, you can see the time series of the stock market prices
of the stock SP 500. In the right hand side, you can see another example
of time series. That is how we collect
a voice or speech data. Related to time series
representation, there is another representation
called spatial data. In spatial data, the
data object could be a GPS trajectory of a vehicle, or the spread of the
disease, or heatmap. In many situations, there is also a time component
in a spatial data. In that case, it is known as spatiotemporal
representation. The attribute of the
spatial data object is also the measurement
for a numerical property. But this time, the measurement is taken
at a given location. Sometimes, the measurement is associated with not
only a location, but also a time point. In that case, the
data representation is called spatiotemporal data. In this example, you
can see that we have one measurement and that is
the population of a city. This measurement is taken
at different locations at three ancient
cities in Europe. This is the perfect
example of spatial data in which we only have one
dimension of locations. Spatial data could appear in
a form of two dimensions. In that case, the location is indicated based on the position of a longitude and latitude. It could also be
three-dimensional, where you have a longitude
and attitude and altitude. Again, we can turn
these intuitions into the mathematic equation. In the representation
of spatial data, we can represent a data object as the list of location enabled measurements in comparison
to timestamped measurements. In this example of
a 2D spatial data, every measurement x_i is
associated with two numbers. One indicates the
longitude of the location and other indicates the
latitude of the location. Again, similar to
time series data, if we don't care about
particular locations, we can also represent
the measurement x as a function of location. In the 2D example, X is the function of the longitude and the
latitude readings. There are many examples
of spatial data. I bet you have seen a lot
of such visualizations. In this example,
we're visualizing the educational spending in United States by school district. There is the numerical
measurement, that is the average
spending per student. Every measurement is
taken associated with a school district which can be described as the longitude
and the latitude. That's how you can make
this nice visualization. But spatial data is much more general than a geographic map. For example, in this example, you can see that we're
using spatial data to represent the
heatmap on a web page. We have one measurement, which is the average
time the users eyes are fixed at a particular
location at the web page. Every location is indicated by a horizontal value
and a vertical value that indicates its
position on this web page. Interestingly, you can even use spatial data representation
to model images. Every common image can be described as the
matrix of pixels. For example, in a 1000
times 1000 pixel image, you have every pixel
can be indexed by the vertical and
horizontal position. In every pixel, we observe
three numerical measurements. One corresponding to
R and G and B colors. Now we have the representation
of spatial data. You can easily generalize that
into spatiotemporal data. The trick is simple; simply add the time dimension into your spatial
data representation. In this case, the data object is associated with the
numerical rating that is associated with not only the two
dimensions of GPS ratings, but also a timestamp. Similarly, you can also represent spatiotemporal data
as the function of the two-dimensions
and a time dimension. Now we can go back
to the example that we've shown earlier
in this lecture. This is a perfect example
of spatiotemporal data. We have one measurement that is the average sentiment score in the tweets posted by people. Every rating is associated with three values: the longitude, the latitude, and a time. That's how you can represent these patterns into a
spatiotemporal data, and you can visualize
them nicely.
