Hi, this is Qiaozhu Mei from School of Information
University of Michigan. Today, we will talk about representations of
real-world data. As we have introduced, there are four
important dimensions of a data mining task. This include data to be mined, knowledge to be discovered, techniques net connects,
the input and output, and applications that the data mining
process is adopted in. Today we will focus on
the data to be mined. So the data to be mined is considered as the input
of that mining process. How different is that? You may have learned
how to collect, how to store and how the process real-world data with Python data structures and tools, such as arrays, such as lists, such as hash tables, lumpy data structures, pandas, databases you name it. Well I have to tell you that these tools are designed for
data storage and processing, but they are not designed
for data mining. In other words, these data structures are not
sufficient for data mining. The reason is easy. Data in the world in reality
are not that simple. There is a huge gap
between real-world data and the analytics for
the data mining process. The tool that you
want to use to bridge this gap is known as
Data Representation. So what is Data Representation? Data Representation
is a mathematical way to describe what
your data look like. Before getting into details, let me show you a few
real-world scenarios from which you can see the importance of formulating your data. This is the web page that
you are so familiar with. When you shop at Amazon, Amazon here then recommends you with alternative products. What can you see from this page? You'll see the title of books
and image covers of books. You'll also see text
descriptions, you'll see numbers, you see prices, you
see number of reviews, you'll see the stars. If you click on the stars, you can actually see users and their comments in free text. You can also see users' comments. This data you can see is
very complicated and messy. How did Amazon generate recommendations from such
complex and messy information? For another example, we have been talking about
biological data mining. But when we talk about
biological data, are we talking about
the DNA sequences, the protein structures, molecular structures
or the chemical forms, or the mixture of all of those. So seeing about this
complicated data, what Python data structure
would you use to load this data to your
memory? It can be very hard. In another example, seeing about the internet we
are using everyday. Internet is essentially
a bunch of servers and terminals that are
connected through wires. But the part of
connections at home is just a very small proportion of this big complex
system out there. This is actually the
entire Internet. How can you deal with this
complicated data structure? Another example, tweets. You see tweets all the time. But a bunch of researchers
in Harvard University and Northeastern University has done some assess on the tweets. From the free text information, they are able to
generate sentiments. They are able to generate time information,
location information. In this visualization,
you can see that they can even deal with how the sentiments of people evolve over
time and location. How complicated is this? Can you think about what Python data structures you use to deal with these answers? What all these scenarios
show is that there's the major challenge that data scientists are facing when they deal with
real world data. This is because we're used
to deal with toy data, well formatted data,
or homogeneous data, for example, or the numbers. But the reality is
much more complicated. We have to deal with
heterogeneous data, data of different types. We have to deal with huge data, large quantity of
data and messy data. So the real challenge is how
to deal with the wild thing. When people describe
the challenge, they like to use the three Vs. The volume, the variety, and the velocity of data. Today, we're going to talk
about the weapon that connects the wild data to
the data mining practices, and this is known as a
step of Data formulation. Although there are more
data science applications than you may imagine, but unfortunately, there aren't
so many basic data types. If we have a formal way to
abstract, to formulate, and to represent the data
in real-world applications, many data mining tasks
can be easily applied. Data formulation is usually
the first step of the mining. Before getting into details, let's start this with a story. This is a story about a skillful butcher in
ancient China in 300 BC. So the butcher works
for a lord and all his job was to cut off oxen. When the mediocre
butcher sees that ox, he says to the animal, he has to sing about how
to deal with the animal, how to cut the ox
into different parts. But when the skillful
butcher sees the ox, he did not see ox. What he saw are
different components, different parts and
their connections. That is why his job has
been much easier and he didn't even need to change
his knife in 90 years. Taking this story, we are
also curious about what a skillful Data Scientist would actually see
in a wild data. In fact, a skillful data
scientist asks a few questions. They ask, what is the basic object of
information in your dataset? They ask, what are the
properties or attributes of each data object and how are
these attributes structured? How to assign values
to these attributes, and how are different
data objects related? Once they can answer
these questions, they know that dataset
so well that they can easily apply any
data science techniques. So the challenge is how to answer these questions in
a mathematical way, which is known as the task
of data representation. This is a smart thing that skillful data scientists do when they face real-world data.
