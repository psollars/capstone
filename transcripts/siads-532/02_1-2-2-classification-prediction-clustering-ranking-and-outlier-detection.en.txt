Let's also take a
look at a few more in depth data mining
functionalities. The first one is known
as classification. The goal of classification is to generate
categorical class label, in this case Y, from a set of attributes of the data object. For example, in spam detection, the data mining system takes the input of
the attributes of the email and tries to make a decision whether this
email is a spam or not, if the prediction is
that it is a spam, it should be moved
into the spam folder. In another example, the
data mining system takes the attributes of a PhD
candidate including their GPA's, including their essays, including their
researcher's statements and want to make a prediction
of whether the student should be admitted to
our PhD program or not. You can see that this is
again a categorical label. Let me give you a concrete
example of a classifier. In this example you
have two classes, one of the classes are
indicated with blue circles, another one with red ones. What a classification
algorithm does is to learn the decision
boundary between those two classes so
that when you see the incoming item, which is not labeled as
either blue or red, you can make the decision, which class this new item belongs to. Techniques people use to make classifiers are basically supervised machine
learning algorithms. In the supervised machine
learning algorithm, a classifier is trained
using labeled training data. That means using data objects which you know the class labels. Then once the model is trained, you use the model to
identify the label of data objects that comes
in without the class labels. Classification, as the data
mining functionality, has been widely adopted in applications
such as loan approval, such as spam detection, such as making diagnosis
in clinical settings, such as predicting the
political leanings of users. In this particular example, if we know the connections
between bloggers, we can guess who have the conservative
political leaning and who has the liberal
political leaning. Another functionality
that is related but different from classification is known as making predictions. In this task, the input is
still a set of attributes of a data object but the output is no longer a categorical label, and instead, the output
is the numerical outcome. For example, you might want to predict the stock
price of given stocks, so you take the input of the market conditions
and you try to make decision on how much
one stock will go up or go down which is numerical. In the other example, you take the input
of the attributes of the soccer player and you want to predict how many goals the player will score in his
team in their next game. Let me give you an
illustrated example. In this example, you have
observed a few data objects. Each of them is associated with the numerical
outcome. What the prediction algorithm, or in this case known as
the regression model, does is to learn a function that explains the set of items, and then based on this model you learned, you want to
make the decision on, in the future time point, whether this model
will go up or go down. Predictions have been
widely accepted and the techniques people use to make predictions include
supervised machine learning, include regression analysis, and, many times, time series analysis if you want to make
predictions for the future. For example, in this application, predictions are used to
support recommender systems. The way people do that is to predict whether the new user will rate a movie as the five star versus four stars or three stars. A familiar example, people
use prediction models in stock market trying to pick stocks for their next investment. Another two examples of predictions are weather forecasting and
election prediction. Unfortunately, we're not doing very well in either
of these cases. Another data mining
functionality that is similar to classification, but not
quite, is known as clustering. It is also trying to
classify data objects into different classes
but this time you actually don't have
predefined classes. In other words, you don't
have training data available. In this example, you can see that there are a bunch
of data objects. The goal of clustering
is to group them into multiple clusters so that data objects
that are similar to each other will be grouped
into the same cluster. Data objects that
are different from each other will be grouped
into different clusters. We don't know which
classes are red, which classes are blue, but we can just make the grouping based on
their relationship. Techniques people use to
solve a clustering problem is usually unsupervised
machine learning. Different from supervised
machine learning, in unsupervised machine
learning you learn the model using unlabeled data
instead of labeled data. Network analysis is another powerful technique
used for clustering. In the network setting, when you want to find a
cluster of nodes it's also known as detecting a community
in the network structure. Like other functionalities,
clustering also have lots of applications especially in social networks to
detect communities, in text mining to extract topics, in business to
segment the market, and also sometimes clusters
can be hierarchical. In this case you can build taxonomies or tree
structures of concepts. In this particular
example we are clustering the programming
languages based on how many users are using
both languages in GitHub. Another related functionality
is known as ranking, and the goal of
ranking is to find a ranked order of data objects. In this example, you are provided with the set of
heterogeneous data objects. The goal is to put them in order, is to determine the order, a list of positions
of these items. You know that the red heart
is more important than blue circle and more important than the green diamonds,
so on and so forth. Machine Learning is also used as the technique to solve
the ranking problem. The objective is no
longer to put items into classes but to include
orders to items. When machine learning
is applied to ranking, this is known as
learning to rank. Again, network analysis is a powerful weapon to
compute ranking of items. For instance, the famous
PageRank algorithm used by Google is based
on network analysis, is based on analyzing large
scale network of webpages. Ranking has been widely
adapted in web search in which the main business is to rank web pages based on
their relevance to a query. Ranking is applied to
recommender systems. Ranking is applied to
bibliometrics, for instance, people rank the importance of scientific publications
based on the number of citations and people rank the quality of researchers
based on so called h-index. Ranking is commonly used
in social networks to identify opinion leaders who
have the most followers, and it's also applied to
sports, for instance, using a data mining algorithm
to predict the NBA drafts, to predict who will be
picked by which team, who will be picked first, who will be picked second, who will be picked
in the second round. Outlier detection is
the functionality in order to find sets of objects that are considerably different from the
reminder of the data. Usually when you conduct outlier detection it is
coupled with trend analysis. In this example, we
can see there are a bunch of blue circles, they are so similar to
each other that you can actually build a model
to explain the trend. But you also see two
elements, two objects, one triangle and one
smiley face that are so different from the
majority of the data. If you can identify them
they are known as outliers. There are many techniques
people use to detect outliers including
signal processing, time series analysis,
and also clustering. Outlier detection has been applied to domains
like fraud detection, network security,
and software bugs. It is not hard to interpret that. In these situations, a fraud, a security attack, or
a software bug can all be considered as
different from the majority. Event detection is also an interesting application of outlier because when there are new events they will usually be surprising patterns of how
people talk about them, how people tweet about them, how people communicate
with each other. Clinical diagnosis can also be interpreted as the example
of outlier detection. If you look at ECG data you want to find
out whether there are anomalies and that is usually indicating
of a disease. So we have introduced a set of basic functionalities
of data mining. Now you should know how they are defined and how they
differ from each other. You should also know
the basic techniques people have been using to solve this data mining
functionalities and how these methods are applied in real
world applications.
