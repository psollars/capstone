To understand why we need
matrix decomposition, why we need to identify orthogonal and
compact vector spaces let me tell you about a real scenario where you
use vectors to represent movie ratings. So instead of handling many
movies let's just look at a simple case where
you only have two movies. So naturally that will help you
define two-dimensions of your vector representation. For every user you can represent
their preferences on the movies and their ratings on both of the movies. So two-dimensional vector for
every user, but probably that you have too many users,
you have many users. And let's assume that
the ratings are numerical so the values on each
dimension are numerical. Now, if we represent
users in original vector space that will define
based on the two movies. We can say that both coordinates
are corresponding to movies. Of course, as we said, and
we hope the coordinates are orthogonal so that we can trust the distance matrix,
but in fact, they're never really
orthogonal to each other. In this coordinate system you can say
they're two coordinates are movies "Troy" and the movies "King Author". If you have watched these movies
you know that there are some interesting relations or
similarities between the two movies. Now given this original vector
space you can represent all the users as data points
obvious vector space. So what can we tell about these users? The x-axis indicates the ratings of
the users on the movie "King Arthur" and the y-axis indicates the ratings and
the movie "Troy". If you see the data point
on the upper-right corner, then those are the users who gave
high ratings on both movies. If you see the data point located
at the lower-left corner, those are the users who gave
low ratings on both movies. So from the layout of the data points, you can see that your data
is sort of correlated. But the correlation is noisy and it is hard to identify what have
contributed to this correlation. So that makes us think what if we can
map this data to a new coordinate system that can better tell us why the data,
how the data is correlated? Hopefully the coordinates in the new
system are orthogonal to each other. So how to deal with it? Intuitively, you can see that we can
find the direction among the data. So this upwards slope direction
seem to capture the major correlation trend of our data,
for example, this direction indicates a type of
movie now known as the epics movies. If we draw this line we can
see that along this line we can describe users who user
gave lower ratings to this type of movies or
high ratings to this type of movies. So data point on the lower-left
corner are the users who gave lower ratings on epics movies. And the data points on the upper-right
corner are the users who gave high ratings on epics movies. So this line actually captures
the majority the major correlation trend, and we call this the first
coordinate of our new system. Now, conditional on the first
coordinate we can find a secondary coordinate which is orthogonal
to the first coordinate. And we hope that this new coordinate
would capture the rest of the variance, so that will help us explain, right? Now, we know that some users like
epic some users don't like epics. Among users who like epics and the users who don't ever epics how
are they different from each other? And this coordinate, for example,
indicates movies starred by Brad Pitt. So this secondary coordinate explains
whether people like Brad Pitt movies or not given that you know they have
different preferences on epics movies. Now the good thing about the two new
coordinates is that after a simple transformation or simple rotation of
our vector space we can now represent these data points on the new coordinate
system with again two dimensions, but the two dimensions
are orthogonal to each other. Because this is the very simple rotation
there's no loss of information, so we have preserved all
the information in our dataset but this new coordinate system is
much more compact and intuitive. Do you agree? So you can see the distribution
of the data is more compact, is more meaningful, is more even
on this new coordinate system. And along one of the dimensions you
can find users you can expect for the users likes epics movies or not. Among the other dimension
you can explain whether the users like Brad Pitt movies or not. So this data point indicate user
who favors epics movies but who's neutral on Brad Pitt movies. And the other data point on this
end indicates the user who dislike epics movies but who has been slightly
positive on Brad Pitt movies. So the new coordinate system
gives them much better, much more intuitive
explanation of our data. This is good, right? And the new coordinates have a special
name they are known as principal components of our vector space,
of our matrix.
