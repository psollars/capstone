So we have learned multiple
data representations and data mining functionalities. I want to get your attention onto
open questions in data mining. The first one is that people are intrigued
about whether there are basic functionalities of data mining that most
or all data mining tasks would care about. And the related question is are there
general ways to implement more complex functionalities of data mining through
those basic ones if they exist? So the answer to these two questions
are related to how we make decisions in real life. In practice, I'd say there are two simple
ways of making decisions about my object. Say if we want to make classification,
if we want to make predictions, if we want to cluster objects,
or if you want to rank objects, usually we either look at whether the data
object has the particular pattern or we look at whether it is
similar to other objects. And here let me give you
an example about basketball. Before college players were
drafted into the NBA league, there will be scouting reports about them. Those reports are written by professionals
who have been following the players for a while. And the purpose of those reports
are describing the properties of the players and
make predictions about their NBA career. So let's take a look at
part of the scout report about the player Zion Williamson
who plays for the Duke University. So in the report we can see that
Zion is all about dominance, power, and athleticism. And you can also see that Williamson
often gets compared to LeBron James, but he's more like Blake Griffin. So one interesting thing to
notice about this report is that the first part describes
a pattern about how Zion plays. In then second part,
the reporter is making comparisons of Zion to two famous players already in NBA. And this is implicitly computing
the similarity between the new player to existing players. Let me give you another example that is
even more related to your daily life. We have all been reading movie reviews. We have been writing movie reviews. So the following reviews were they
were extracted from the Internet. You can see that one of the persons
state that they like the movie because it stars someone and
because it was set in Chicago. Another typical reviews is that I like
the movie because it shows something, it shows Cowboy culture as it
really is which is pretty cool. And then you can see that there's another
type of reviews which states that I like the movie because it
reminds me of another movie. So if we read him to these reviews,
we can see that the first review is describing one
particular pattern of the movie, right, who stars in it and
where it was shot. And the second review is describing
a different pattern which is about the theme in the movie. And the third review is essentially
comparing this current movie to another movie which means they are
comparing this movie to similar movies. Again, the decision-making process
has been driven by either pattern or the similarity of data objects. Indeed, pattern and similarity are two
basic outcomes of data mining that sort of apply to almost all data
recommendations including itemsets, including matrices,
including sequences, time services, or other data representations
as we have none of. And these two basic functionalities
can be used to build almost all other complex functionalities such as
classification, such as clustering, such as ranking, predictions,
anomaly detection, so on so forth. Or even though using
this to functionalities may not be the best way to
build other functionalities.
