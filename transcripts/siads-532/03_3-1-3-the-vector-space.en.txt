Some other interesting concepts about
matrix data are the coordinate system and vector space. Remember that every vector or every
matrix have a fixed number of dimensions. We can interpret every
dimension as one coordinate and that gives us a coordinate system. You're familiar is 2D coordinate systems. You're also familiar is
3D coordinate systems. In this particular example,
we have three dimensions. We have the H, the credit score, and
annual income of your customers. Once we can define the coordinate system,
every vector can be just visualized in this coordinate space
as one direction plus the magnitude. For example, while the users can be
placed as this line with the arrow and in case the direction and the length of this line corresponds to the
magnitude of this user on that direction. You can project another user
in this coordinate system. And this gives us the vector space. Based on this vector space, you can conduct many basic
operations of the vectors. For example, you can do additions,
you can subtract one vector from another, you can even compute the average
of many different users. And that basically gives you a new
vector that defines the new dimension, a new direction and a new magnitude. Now we understand how to represent
your data into vectors and matrices. Let's do a simple practice. Let's look at text data. You have three documents. First document contains two words: text,
mining. The second document contains
three words: data, size, data. The third document contains
two words: text, data. So how can we represent the three
documents into vectors and into a matrix? That is basically asking how we
can construct the vector space or calling the system of this data. The first thing we do is to identify the
number of unique words in this database, in this collection of documents. And that will give you the dimensionality
of your vector of matrix. So the vocabulary of this simple text
data set contains four words: text, mining, data, and science. That gives us four dimensions. Based on the four dimensions,
we can now represent every document as the least of numbers corresponding
to each of the dimensions. So document 1 becomes the vector 1 1 0 0 corresponding to the word text,
mining, data, and science. The second document
becomes the vector 0 0 2 1 because the word data appears
twice in this document. And third document corresponds
to the vector 1 0 1 0 and all three documents gave us this matrix. It has 3 rows corresponding
to three documents and four columns corresponding to four words. Now given this matrix, we can use
our favorite transpose operation to achieve the transpose of this matrix
where the words become the rows and the documents become the columns. So we can take a look at this 4 by
3 matrix on the right hand side. Every row is the vector
of three dimensions and that gives us the representation
of a particular word. So the word text corresponds
to the vector 1 0 1 because it appears in document 1 and document 3. And the word data corresponds
to the vector 0 2 1 because it appears twice in document 2 and
only once in document 3. With all these,
we have talked about how to use vector and matrices to represent a data set. I hope you understand how vectors and matrices can be used to
represent numerical data. And once you to understand
the difference between itemsets and vectors, in particular,
itemsets can be viewed as binary vectors. And I want you to understand that the
vector space facilitates many data mining operations on your vector data from
very simple ones like addition like subtraction to more complex
ones that will be introduced later.
