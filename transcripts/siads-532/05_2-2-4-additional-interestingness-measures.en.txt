So lift is one of the
interesting metrics that has been used in
many applications. Another important
measure is chi-square. The basic idea behind
chi-square is that we're conducting this
hypothesis test to test whether two variables
are independent or not. In our scenario, each of the
variables are the pattern. So we want to show whether
the two patterns, x and y, are independent or whether
they are dependent. (pause) So in this chi-square test,
we need to compute the test statistic that is known as the chi-square. If you write down the equation
of chi-square, we can say that it
is the summation over all possible values of the variable i and all
positive values of variable j. In our case, i and j basically
indicates whether one of the variables appear or do not
appear in our transaction. So if you look at this
contingency table, you can see that the
contingency table is essentially divided into two by two conditions, i equals to one or i equals to zero and j equals one
and j equals to zero. If i equals to one
and j equals one, that gives us the number where both of the items
appear in the transaction, and if i equals to one
and j equals to zero, that gives us a number where either i appear in
the transaction, but j does not. Similarly, this number gives us the total number transactions
with i equals to one, this number gives us
the total number of transactions with
j equals to one, and this number gives us the total number
of transactions. So chi square can
be calculated by summarizing all the
four conditions, one, two, three, and four. In each of the conditions, we have a number right
from the table minus another number that is known as an expected value
in the corresponding cell. We'll expand that in a minute. Once we sum up, once we compute of that number in each of the cell minus the expected number in each cell, we take the square and we normalize that by the
expected number in each cell. Then, we sum up this
statistic over the one, two, three, four conditions
to get the chi square value. n_ij is the observed count
of one of the four cells and n_ij is the expected
count of the same cell. How to compute the
expected count of cell? It is actually simple. The expected count of a cell in this two way contingency table is essentially the
corresponding number, total number of the row times the corresponding
sum of the column and normalized by
the sample size. So when we want to compute the expected number of this cell, all we need to do is to get
the row total of this row, that is this number, times the column total of this corresponding column that is this number and
then normalize that by the total sample size which is this number and once we can calculate the chi square value of any given two variables, x and y, you can either compare this chi square value which is the critical value of a
given confidence level by looking up the chi square
test table or you can essentially just rank
association rules based on the chi square. The higher the chi square value, the more significant
the association rule. So now, we know how to calculate the chi square value
of association rule. Are you confident of doing
some calculations by yourself? In this particular example, we are given the real
example of two variables, game and video again. This table will not only
give you the observed value of transactions with or without games and with or without videos. We have also given you the expected value of
number of transactions, with or without game, with or without video
in the brackets. Once again, this
expected values are calculated by the product of the row total and product of the column total normalized by the total number
of transactions. So now, can we compute the chi square of the two
variables game and video? Remember that the
chi square value is the summation over the
four conditions one, two, three, and four. In each condition, we have
the observed value of a cell minus the expected
value of the cell, takes a square and
then normalized by the expected value of
the corresponding cell. To put the numbers back in, we can see that in a first cell, we have 4,000 here minus 45,000 and it's over here and take the square
normalized by 45,000. In the second condition, we have 3,500 minus 3,000, take the square and
normalize it by 3,000, so and so forth. We do this for all the one, two, three, and four conditions. Then, we add them together
that gave us number 555.6 which I can tell you
is the very high score. So by doing this, we have calculate the chi square of the two variables
games and video. But notice that the chi square sum up all the four conditions. That means it does
not distinguish direction from game to video
or from game to no videos. They just give you the
overall correlation between the two variables. So we have introduced
the lift and the chi square as two
interesting measures. You may wonder how many
interesting measures are there. According to the 2012 paper, people have listed more than 20 such
interesting measures. They more or less
measure similar effects, that is how strong
the correlation between two frequent
patterns x and y is and the more or less takes advantage of the two
way contingency table. Which one works the
best? It is hard to say. But in reality, some of them are used more often than others. If you're interested, you can take a look at the original paper and see how they evaluate the different
interestingness measures.
