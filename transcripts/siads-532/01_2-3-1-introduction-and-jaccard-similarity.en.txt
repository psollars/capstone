Hi. This is Qiaozhu Mei. Today we'll talk about the
similarity between itemsets. As we now know that similarity, similar to patterns is one of the basic
data-mining outcomes that we can use to build many more complex
data-mining functionalities. What is Similarity? Similarity basically measures how much two data objects are alike. A related concept is distance which
measures the opposite, how much the two
objects are dissimilar. The detailed defination
of similarity and distance relies on which data
representation you select. Since we're interesting
in itemsets, let's look at how to measure the similarity
between two itemsets. Again, let's look at this
example of five transactions. Every transaction
contains a set of items. So how do we measure the
similarity between transactions? Do you think transaction
two and transaction three are more similar than transaction two and
transaction four? What are the duration of measuring similarity
between itemsets? Intuitively, two itemsets are similar if they share
a lot of items. If you look at transaction
two and transaction three, they share three items, so we think that they
may be very similar. But in practice,
longer itemsets are just more likely to share
more items with other items. That does not mean that they are more similar to these itemsets. So in practice, we want to
credit those itemsets that share a lot of items
but we want to penalize itemsets
that are just longer. One way to formally think
about the two intuitions is to look at the intersection and the union of two itemsets. The intersection of two
itemsets written as A cup B majors the longest common subset
of the two itemsets, and the union of two
itemsets A and B written as AUB gives us the smallest
common super set of A and B. To show you a particular example, when we look at two itemsets one contains beer, milk
and watermelon. The other contains
milk, beer and lemon. We can see that the intersection
of the two itemsets is the itemset beer and milk because both beer and milk appear
in both of the itemsets and there's no other items that appear in both
of the itemsets. Similarly, the union between the two three itemsets is the longer itemsets that
contains four items beer, milk, watermelon, and lemon. This is because any
of the items in the original two itemsets
appear in the four itemsets, and no item in the four itemsets does not appear in either
of the itemsets. Based on definition of
the intersection and the union of two itemsets
we can now measure the similarity between two itemsets. A
classic measurement of the similarity of two sets is known as the Jaccard Similarity. Jaccard Similarity also known as the Jaccard coefficient
or the Jaccard index. It can be calculated
in a very simple way. It is basically counting the number of items
even intersection of two sets mobilized by the number of items in the
union of the two sets. So here, the two
vertical line reads as the number of items when
we're talking about itemsets. Intuitively, two sets will have a high Jaccard distance if
they share a lot of items, that means, the
number of items in their intersections
will be large. Two sets will have a smaller Jaccard similarity if their union is very large. That means, if either of
the sets is too long, then the number of
items in the union of the two sets will also be large. Once you can compute
the Jaccard similarity, you can also compute
the opposite major, which is the Jaccard distance. The Jaccard distance
is essentially one minus the Jaccard similarity. Jaccard similarity has a few very nice properties
mathematically. First, it is symmetric. That means, if you compute
the Jaccard distance or the Jaccard similarity of
item set A and item set B, it is equivalent to the Jaccard similarity of
item set B to item set A. The Jaccard similarity is nicely bounded between zero to one. That says, Jaccard
similarity is the minimal. It is zero if the two
sets share no items. If the two sets
share no items that means their
intersection is empty. The largest possible value for the Jaccard
similarity is one. That can be achieved if the two sets are
identical to each other. When two sets are identical, their intersection is essentially the same set of their union. In that situation,
Jaccard similarities is one and Jaccard
distance will be zero. Now let's take a look at a simple example of how to
calculate Jaccard similarity. Given this five
transaction database, we can compute the
Jaccard similarity of transaction one
and transaction two by counting how many items are shared by
transaction one and two. We only have two
items beer and milk. We normalize that
by the number of items in either transaction
one or transaction two. In that case, we have five items. So the Jaccard similarity
between transaction one and transaction two is 2
over 5, that is 0.4. Similarly, we can compute
the Jaccard similarity between transaction two
and transaction three. The intersection of
these two transactions contain three items beer, milk, and lemon, and the union of the two transactions
contains four items. So the Jaccard similarity between these two transactions is 0.75. So you can see that T2 is most
similar to T3 than to T1. Based on the knowledge of
Jaccard similarity can you calculate the similarity
between T2 and T4 by yourself? Now, computing the
similarity between two itemsets looks easy. It is also very powerful. I want to tell you another
very interesting usage of the similarity
of items, that is, making use of a Jaccard
similarity to compute the similarity of items
instead of the transactions. The idea is simple, from this transactional
database where every transaction
contains a set of items. We can transpose it, we can do some
transformation to get another data set where every item is represented as a set of
transactions it appears in. So in this case, we can see that the item beer appears in
four transactions T1, T2, T3, and T5, and item milk
appear in four transactions T1, T2, T3, and T4. After this transformation, we have the itemsets representation
of every product. Then we can measure
the similarity between every pair of items based on the Jaccard
similarity of the set of transactions
they're appearing. So in this example, we can compute the Jaccard
similarity between the item beer and item milk which is the
intersection of transactions. The number of
transactions contain both of the items is three, and the number of transactions contain either of
the items is five. So we say that similarity between the item beer and
item milk is 0.6. Similarly, the similarity between the item beer and item lemon, is the size of the intersection of the transactions
containing the three unless by the size
of the union of the transactions containing
either of them is four. So we can see that beer
is actually more similar to lemon rather than to
milk in our example. Based on the calculation of Jaccard similarity between items, can you tell the
difference between the Jaccard similarity and the support of the two itemsets? Once you can calculate
the similarity between itemsets and between items, you can use them for many
complex data-mining tasks. For example, when you deal
with two data objects that can be represented as
itemsets such as text, you just need to compute
the pairwise similarity between any pair of
this data objects. Through these similarities,
you can do classification, you can do clustering, you can do ranking, and you can do recommendation. This data mining
functionalities can be applied to many
real world scenarios. For example, if we represent text data as
itemsets and measures the similarity between
these [inaudible] , we can provide real-world
applications such as plagiarism detection or
re-duplicating webpages. This is because a
large proportion of webpages you know Internet
or near duplicates. If we can measure the similarity
between webpages easily, we can filter those that
are near duplicates. Since we can represent
shopping baskets as itemsets, through computing the
similarity of shopping baskets, we can cluster our customers based on what they have bought. We can profile our customers and we can make
market segmentation. Another interesting use
of itemset similarity is to compute the similarity of friend lists in a social network. By doing that, we can
make recommendations. We can recommend to one user
to friend another user. If they share a large number of friends in their friend lists. We can also recommend a
Twitter user to follow a particular user if
they share a lot of followers or if they follow
the same set of people. As a summary of
itemsets similarity, now you should know how to
measure similarity between itemsets through
Jaccard similarity. You need to know how to calculate the Jaccard similarity
and I hope you understand that Jaccard
distance essentially just one minus the
Jaccard similarity. I hope you can use itemsets
similarity for computing complex data-mining
operations and for applying these data-mining
functionalities to real-world data to
real-world scenarios.
