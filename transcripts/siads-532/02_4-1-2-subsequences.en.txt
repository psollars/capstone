So we have introduced
the general definition of sequence representation. There are a few related concepts to sequence representation. One of them is subsequence. So a subsequence is part of a longer sequence after dropping certain items
from the longer sequence, as long as you keep the order. So in this case, if we still denote x_1, x_2, to x_k as the original
sequence, and 1, 2, to k are the orders
of these items, we can define a subsequence of this longer sequence as
another set of items, and these items all appeared
in the original sequence, and that means the index of this items have appeared
in the original sequence x, but they may or may not
be exactly k items, they may be fewer
number of items. As long as these indices
are preserving the order. So X prime is the
subsequence of X. In other words,
all the k items in a subsequence have to appear
in the original sentence, and their orders have
to be identical, but the actual position indices may or may not be
exactly the same. So let me give you some
examples of subsequences. Still remember this example of sequences to be or not to be. So in this sequence, the items are words, and words have orders. We can name the subsequences
of this longer sequence, and we can characterize them
into different lengths. So length three
subsequences of to be, or not to be would come in
the following sequences; to be or, be or not, or not to, and not to be. We can see that in each
of these subsequences, all the words have appeared again in the
original sequence. In this case, they're all considered active in
the original sequence. So if this is a case, we call this subsequences
conservative subsequences. Then we can see another
set of subsequences. They also have the
same lengths three, but the difference between
the first set is that, among these items when they appear in the
original sentence, there might be gaps. In other words, they
may or may not be conservative in the
original sentence. For instance, to be not, you can see that
all the three items appeared in the
original sequence, and the orders are preserved. But what's omitted
is another word, or in between be and not. In this case, to be not
is still considered as the subsequence of
the original sentence but it's no longer a
consecutive sequence, it's a long consecutive
subsequence. This applies to the
other subsequences; be not be, to to be, and to or not. So all items have appeared but there might be gaps
in between those items. Now if you look at
these two examples, these two are also
length three sequences, not be to, or, or be be. Are these still subsequences
of the original sentence? In fact, in this
case they are not. Although, all the items have also appeared in the
original sentence, to be, or not to be, you
can see that you can't find an align
order among them. So in this case, these shorter sequences have violated the original order
in the original sentence, and that's why they're not considered as subsequences
of the original one.
