So now, we have got all the itemsets
that are frequent in a database. How do we use them? Remember that our ultimate goal is to
use these patterns for decision-making. In practice, not all of the frequent
patterns may be interesting. Only a few of them can really
support our decisions. So we need a way to evaluate the true
knowledge from the frequent patterns. We need a way to evaluate how interesting
are those frequent patterns for our decision-making. One of the problem of frequent pattern
mining is that there are just too many itemsets, too many frequent
patterns extracted. One way to shrink the number of
interesting patterns is to go for the max and closed patterns. A closed pattern is defined as
the itemset if this itemset is frequent, and there's no super-pattern that
has the same support as this item. And the max pattern is
the itemset if it's frequent and there exists no super-pattern
that is also frequent. So based on the two definitions, you can
see that every max pattern is also closed. But not all the closed
patterns is a max pattern. By looking for max patterns and
closed patterns, we can get rid of many shorter
patterns that are just frequent, because they're subsets of
longer frequent patterns. Using the same five transaction
database as the example, we're interested in extracting patterns
with the minimal support of 40%. If we look at the three
patterns in this database, beer and milk with the support 60%. Beer, milk, and
lemon with the support 40%. Beer, milk, and
lollipops with the support 20%. Based on this statistics,
we can see that the pattern beer and milk is the closed pattern because there
exists no superset of this pattern. There exists no longer patterns
that have the same support. And the three itemset beer,
milk and lemon is the max pattern. Because there exists no longer
patterns that is also frequent. And of course, the three itemset
is also a closed pattern. Because there exists no longer
patterns with the same support.
