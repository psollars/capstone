As we said that zero probably more
data data science applications or real world tenses than you can imagine but
there aren't so many basic data types or
basic data representations. We will discuss a few of
them in this lecture for example items sets, vectors or
matrix, sequence data, time series data, spatial data,
spatial temporal data. Graph data or network data and
data streams. Starting from next slide we've
introduced each data type one by one, let's first look at item sets. Suppose you are dealing
with the data object. That is the shopping basket. You can see that a shopping
basket contains a list of items, a list of products. In this particular example,
the attribute of this data object of a shopping basket is essentially
the appearance of a categorical item, the other examples you can also describe
a piece of text as the item set. And in that case
the attribute will be a word. Now we can use mathematic equations
to describe the same thing, in item set representation we can
write down the data object as the big X the uppercase X and now it
can be represented as the set of items. In this set every item lowercase x belongs
to the data object belongs to the set. If and only if the corresponding
categorical item appears in the set and in this representation, you can see that the order of individual
items don't really matter and that says if you spec the positions of
X1 and X2 it is still the same set. Item sets although very
simple it can be used to describe many different real world data
shopping baskets, we have discussed. Text is another example when you use
item sets to represent text data, it is known as bag-of-words. In other words, we can represent a piece
of text as the set of keywords and if we don't care about the order
of the keywords or how many times they appear in a text we can easily
use the word cloud to represent it. And the word cloud is actually
a simple example of item set but sometimes we do care about the numbers. Vector data is the another data
representation that can be used to model data with counts. Data objects you can use vector
data to represent include users ratings of products or course grades of
a student, in this particular example, you can see that this customer
has purchased a list of products. And she actually gave different
scores to review each of the product. The attribute in this example is
the numerical property of the object and in this particular example is
the numerical rating of the product. So in a vector representation,
you can see that different from item set. Every data object is now represented
as the n-dimensional vector, every dimension of the vector corresponds
to one attribute of the data. We add a small arrow on
top of the uppercase X to indicate this is the vector. Every lowercase x is
the numerical value of x and i's dimension,
which is the corresponding attribute and now you can see that every attribute
is unique to that dimension and you cannot easily change
the order of the two attributes. So every data object can be represented
as the vector then what about multiple objects? It is simple. You can represent multiple data objects
as a matrix, which is essentially a collection of vectors with
the same number of dimensions. There are many examples of how people use
matrices to represent real world data for example in recommend assistance people use
matrices to represent product ratings. Every row of the matrix
corresponds to the user and every column of a matrix corresponds
to the product of a movie. And the numerical values of every element corresponds to the rating
the user assigns to the item. In biological data mining people
represent microarray as matrices in a microarray every row is the gene and every column corresponds to the sample or
the experiment condition. And every numerical value, each dimension
is the expression level of a gene. Let's talk about another type of data
representation that is also related to item sets. We call this sequence data. Sequence representation can usually
be used to represent eigdata objects such as curriculum paths,
such as the DNA sequence, such as a session of search queries, a sentence
of words or the trace of user actions. And the attributes in a data object
in a sequence representation of pairs of positions and
categorical items in a sequential order. In this example, you can see that our
degree program can be represented as the sequence where every
categorical item is the course and there's the particular
order of the courses. You have to take introduction to Python
before you take Python path data science before you can take degree
courses such as data mining one. And then after this course,
you can take another course, we can formally represent a sequence data
using the following mathematic equation. So again, we use uppercase X
to indicate the data object. Now, you can see that X is
actually the set of pairs. Every pair has the lowercase x i
which is the categorical item and a number 1, 2, 3, 4, that indicates
the ith position of the sequence. So this representation tells us at
each position what item is observed. There are many examples of sequence data,
for example in biological data mining
people deal with DNA sequences. There are only four category items A,
C, G, and T but because they can appear
in different orders. We have different DNAs
of different species. What's interesting here is that in
biological data mining people usually add spaces in between the items so that
they can align different DNA sequences. And this is telling us that in sequence
data the order of the items is much more important than
the actual position. In the example on the right hand
side you can see that this is the sequence of search actions. The user of the Yahoo search engine typed
in a query then they click on the URL. Then another URL, then they click
on the query suggestion button, then they modify their query into
a new query so-and-so forth. Based on the sequence of actions
a search engine can much better estimate what the user actually wants and
provide personalized search results.
