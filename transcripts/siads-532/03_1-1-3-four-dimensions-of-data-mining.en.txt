So now you have seen
different views of data mining from
different practices. Where you have a
data mining task, you can usually describe the
task using four dimensions; the first dimension is
the data to be mined, which is actually the input
of the data mining task. The second dimension is the
knowledge to be discovered. What type of patterns are
trying to discover from the data and this is the output
of your data mining task. Then we will talk
about the techniques that people use to connect
the input to the output. The fourth dimension is about applications in which people adapt this data mining process. So where to use this
data mining process. Let's look at them one by
one. Data to be mined. To think about what
kind of data can data mining process
take as input. We can characterize
real-world data based on either the formal types
or representations. We can divide data into itemsets, into vectors or matrices,
into sequences, time-series, spatiotemporal data, or data streams,
graphs, and networks. Taking a different perspective, we could also divide real world data based on the genre or application domains. If you take this view, you can categorize data as
transactional data, text data, web data, multimedia data, social and information networks, biological data,
or user behaviors. This application
driven categorization is also very useful
in real-world tasks. The second dimension of
a data mining task is what kind of knowledge are
you trying to discover. This is also known as the
data mining functionalities. What functionality do you want to provide through a
data mining process. These functionalities
could include lower-level outputs such
as patterns from the data. Which data objects are co-occurring with which
other data objects. Similarities of data, right, what's the closest object to the given data object or
associations of data. The functionalities also include higher-level outputs that could be directly used to
support decisions. For example classifications,
clustering, trends, predictions, and outliers on the
even higher level. Based on the goal of data mining, whether you're trying to
describe or characterize that data set or whether you are
trying to make predictions, a data mining process
can also be divided into descriptive or predictive. Once you define the input and output over a data
mining process, you can talk about
the techniques that connects the input to the output. Particular techniques used in the data mining process include data cubing, machine learning, statistics, pattern
recognition, user modeling, information visualization,
and data-intensive computing. Once you can generate the
output from the input, the data mining process can be applied in many
different domains. We gave a few examples but there are many more examples out there. For example, in retail people use data mining to do
smart advertisements, to segment their market. In telecommunication, people
use data mining to detect spam course which unfortunately we are not doing
very well nowadays. In banking, people use data mining to make
decisions unknowns. Based on the applicants
credit scores which can be estimated
strategic planning process, you can make decisions on whether to approve a loan or not. People apply data mining to social networks such as
Facebook and Twitter. They use data mining to recommend friends and they rank
the Facebook feeds, then use feeds in
those social networks and of course people use data mining to drive
scientific discoveries. This is very much
related to Jim Gray's, The Fourth Paradigm of Science. Google uses data mining to answer complicated questions to provide personalized search
results to the users. The Wall Street's also use data mining to build
portfolios of stocks. Data mining is also
applied to text and you may have heard about techniques cut natural language processing, that's about making
sense from text data. Medical practitioners
also use data mining. Data mining has been one of the technical foundations of
health informatics nowadays. These are just some examples of application domains
of data mining and there are many other of them. So in this lecture, we have given the
general definition of data mining and
several variations. Based on the definitions, you should now understand
relation of Data Mining to other concepts such as Machine Learning such
as Data Science. Based on the practice domains, people have different
views of data mining. So there's the data-based view, there is a Machine Learning view, there is that business analytics view and there is
the human-centered view. We also talk about the four
important dimensions of data mining tasks that is data, knowledge, technique and
the application domain.
