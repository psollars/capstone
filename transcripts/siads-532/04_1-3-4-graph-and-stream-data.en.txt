Now, let me talk about another data representation that is slightly more complicated. This is known as the graph
representation of the data. In graph representation, the data object could be
the online social network, or the Internet, or the web. Now, what's interesting
about the data objects here is that there are two attributes. There are nodes and
there are links. In this particular example, we have four nodes, each of them corresponds
to the person. Two people may or
may not be linked. If they are friends, you can see the link between each other, if they aren't friends you don't see link
between each other. A set of nodes and links
form a network structure. Mathematically, we can formulate the graph data as the following. We use G to indicate a network, and G can be composed into a set of vertices
and a set of edges. We use V to indicate
a set of nodes. In other contexts,
they are also referred to as vertices or entities. So V is the set of
nodes and you can see that V itself is actually
a data representation. What is it? It's the item set. A node can be a categorical item, but sometimes it could also
be a complex data object. Besides the set of nodes, we also have a set of links. We use E to indicate
a set of links. In other contexts, a
link is also known as the edge or the relation
between two nodes. So you can see that the list of links is also represented
as the items, but here every item
is the pair of nodes, instead of a categorical item. There are many many
examples of networks. You can use graphs to
represent mass of raw data. In this interesting example, we are seeing a high-school
dating network, where the nodes are
high school students. There is the edge between two students if they have dated. So you can see this nice stay
connected network diagram and indicates the relationship of high-school students overall. In another example, which
is even more surprising, you can also use networks to
represent a soccer match. In this soccer match, Nas to World Cup, you can see that every
team is represented as the network where every
node indicates a player. There is the edge between two players if one has
passed to another. In this case, there are weights
on different edges. A thicker edge means that one player frequently passes
the soccer ball to another. Another complex data
representation is known as data streams
or stream data. Data streams is usually used to model objects that arrive
with continuous time stamps. Examples include e-mail
inboxes or news feeds. In a data stream,
every data object could be any
complicated data types. In this case, every
data object is the e-mail that this person
receives in her inbox. It could well be
network packages. Every attribute of the data
object could be anything plus a time stamp where this data object
appears in inbox. So more formally,
we can write down the data stream as a
set of data objects. Here, every data object
is associated with a time stamp that indicates when this
data object appears. Here, we use big X_ k
instead of lowercase x. Because a data object could
be either simple or complex. It could be a categorical item. It could also be a network. It could also be even the
image or time series. There are many examples of data streams and I bet
you have seen a lot. In this example, you can
see that all the tweets posted by the UMSI career
services form a data stream. In this data stream, every tweet is the object, and every tweet is
associated with the arrival time stamp that indicates when the
tweet was posted. Another good example
of data streams is the security camera
you can find on highways. In this example, every vehicle is the
complicated data object. The time when this vehicle
appear in the frame of this CCTV camera indicates the arrival time of the
data object in the stream.
