Now we have introduced multiple basic data
representations. Let's take some time
to do the practice to see how much you have
understand them. Let's think about a
real world example. You are dealing with a
sentence which is so famous, "To be or not to be." How can you formally represent this data so that you can
make this ready for analysis? In fact, you can
see that there are many different ways you
can formulate this data. You could apply many different
data representations. For example, you can represent this sentence
as a bag of words. If you take the item
set representation, you can represent this sentence as a set of just four words; to, be, or, not. Remember that if you take
this simple representation, you're ignoring the orders of
the words in the sentence. If you think that counts
of words matter to you, you can instead use the
vector representation. In this case, the
same sentence is represented as the vector
with four attributes; 2,2,1, and 1, that
indicates how many times every word appear
in this document. If you think the order of
the words matter to you, you can alternatively represent this sentence as a sequence. Now you have choices. You could represent the sentence as a sequence of characters. If you do that, you can see that every data attribute
will be the character. There is the order that organizes the state
of characters. You could also use the same
sequence representation, but this time, treating every word as your
basic attribute. If you do that, the
same sentence can be represented as the
ordered list of words, to, be, or, not, to, be. Now you cannot switch the
order of two different words. People can also
represent a piece of text as the network of words. In this network, every
note is the single word. Two notes are connected with
the link if they co-occur, if they are next to each other. In this case, you can construct
network of four notes, and you have four edges. This is interesting, isn't it? You can use different
representations to represent the same
real world data. So which one should I choose? In fact, the choice of particular data representation
depends on the task. It also depends on what information you think are important in your analysis. So in this lecture, we have introduced the task
of data formulation. In most cases, data formulation
is the first task of data mining that connects
the massive, noisy, complex real-world data to the well-formatted
version that you can readily applying
data mining techniques. We have introduced particular
data representations. We have shown that for
the same real-world data, different representations
may be applied. You can choose from
represented data as item sets, as matrices, as time series, as sequences, as metrics, or as data streams. Your particular choice depends on your task and application.
