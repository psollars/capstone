Hello, this is Qiaozhu Mei. Today, we will talk about
mining frequent itemsets. So now, we know that patterns are one
particular date mining outputs that are so
basic and you can make use of them to build other
data mining functionalities. A pattern is the structure
of attributes that represents the intrinsic
important property of data objects. We also talked about the particular definition of a pattern depends on what
data representation you use. So what is the pattern
in itemset data? If you represent your data as the set of items,
what is the pattern? In itemset data, a pattern could be a frequent subset of items, it could also be the association rule or a
correlation between two items, so on and so forth. Before giving formal definitions of a pattern in itemsets, let's talk about two
related concepts. Subset and superset. Suppose we have two itemsets, one is X_1 and the other is X_2. We see that X_1 is
the subset of X_2. If every item content itemset
X_1 is also content in X_2. This is equivalent to say
that X_1 appears in X_2. So if X_1 either subset of X_2, that means X_1 is shorter, X_2 is longer and X_2 have to contain
all the items in X_1. In this situation, we
can also see that X_2 is a superset of X_1 or
X_2 contains X_1. To give a particular example, we can see that the
following itemset, watermelon and rabbit
is the subset of the following longer itemset
that contains five items. So both rabbit and watermelon, appear in other itemset. It is equivalent to say that the five itemset is the superset of the
first shorter itemset. With these two concepts, we can now define the
frequent itemset. So we call the itemset a k-itemset if it contains
exactly k items. In this case, X contains
k-items from x_1-x_k, we call it a k-itemset. If it contains only one item, its the one itemset. If it contais three items, is the three itemset. We can check the frequency
of this itemset in a database to compute the
support of this itemset. There are two versions of
support about an itemset. One, the absolute support
that measures the number of transactions in a database
that contain itemset X. In more cases, we care about the relative
support of the itemset. Now, these fraction of fractions in a database that
contain the itemset X. Why? Because different databases, have different number
of transactions. Talking about the fractions of transactions, is
more meaningful. So based on the support
of the itemset, we call the itemset X a frequent itemset if its support is low less
than a given threshold. So if the support of x, is beyond the given illustration
of minimal support. The X is called frequent itemset. In reality, itemset data are usually used to represent
shopping baskets. In this particular example, we have a database of
five transactions. Every transaction
contains a set of items that the
costumer have bought. So we can see that the first
one, contains three items. The second transaction,
contains four items, so on and so forth. Then based on the database, we can compute the support
of every possible itemset. For example, this is type one item set that
contains only one item the beer because it appears in four out of five
transactions database. We say that the support of the
one itemset is 80 percent. Similarly, this two itemset, beer and milk, up here seen three out of five
transactions seen in the database. So the support of this two
itemsets is 60 percent. I know that data
miners like to talk about patterns of
beer and diaper. I can not find an emoji of diaper so I'm using milk instead. You can also compute the
support of longer patterns. For example, if we compute the support
for these three item, beer, milk and lemon, we can find the
support as 40 percent. Suppose your manager only
can support patterns that have the minimal
support of 50 percent, then among the three
patterns we have calculated, only the beer and
the two itemsets, beer and milk are frequent. The three itemset, beer, milk and lemon, is
no longer frequent. So this is the definition
of a frequent itemset. A related pattern, is
called association rule. Association rule
majors association between one itemset
to another itemset. So we may write X-Y. That means both X
and Y are itemsets. Similar to itemsets, we can also measure the support of
their association rule. The support of the
association rule from X-Y, is essentially the
probability that the transaction in your
database contains both X and Y. Different from the itemset, we have another
important metric for association rule that is
known as the confidence. The confidence of the
association rule from X-Y, majors the conditional
probability that a transaction that already
contains X also contains Y. So you can say that the support measures the marginal
probability of X and Y, and the confidence majors the conditional
probability of Y given X. Let me give you a few examples. In the same database
of five transactions, we have computed the support
of the two itemsets, beer and milk, the support
of which is 60 percent. Now, we can compute the
support and confidence for this association
rule from beer to milk. The support of this
association rule, is essentially the support
of the two itemset pattern, beer and milk which
is 60 percent. The confidence of this
association rule, can be calculated as how
many transactions that have the item beer also
have the item milk, and we can see that there are three out of four transactions. So the confidence from beer
to milk is 75 percent. In practice, we usually
write the two numbers, the support and confidence in the same bracket to indicate the probability
of this association rule. So based on this definition, can you compute the
support and confidence of the new association rule
from beer and milk to lemon? You can take a while to compute
and the answer is that, the support of this pattern is 40 percent and the confidence
of this association rule is 66.7 percent because
two transactions out of three that have beer
and milk, also have lemon. Frequent itemsets and
association rules, are very simple data
mining concepts but they are already
very powerful and they are widely used in real-world applications such
as recommender systems. Here, we are giving
the example of the Amazon's recommender system that you're looking
at everything. In the top section of
this recommender system, you can see that Amazon is recommending books that are
frequently bought together. If you represent every
shopping basket as a set of items instead of three books is essentially a
frequent itemset. Even though our section of
this recommender system, you can see that
Amazon is recommending books to customers who have already bought
the given book. In this case, you
can see that Amazon is essentially computing
the association rules. Given that the customers
have bought one book, how confident that they will purchase the
following books. This is the perfect example of the association rule.
