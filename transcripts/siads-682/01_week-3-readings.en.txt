Okay, let's get to work exploring and
situating the readings for week three which is about networks. So I know that in your networks class
that you've taken on the way to taking this class, you've talked
about how networks can be everywhere. You can find them anywhere you look. That's certainly true in social media
where the networks can be either explicit. So something through the follower
following relationship or implicit through interaction. So we might form networks or
induce networks via interaction. So if I interact with, if I'm account A and
interact with account B in some way, we form an edge between A and B. The objectives for
this week as I've put here again are for you to articulate how networks
can be the substrate for modern social media networks and
how those networks can be different. And so
I'm going to ask you to describe how and why different networks can
exist within the same data. And then in the assignment for this week,
you're going to be thinking about and constructing different varieties
of metrics over these networks and what those things might mean. And the readings this week, as I have
intended every week, intend to kind of stimulate your thinking around
how these might be useful and in what ways these might matters. So the first piece is
a piece by Sinan Aral and colleagues out of MIT looking at
the spread of true and false news online, and particularly it's looking at the
spread of true and false news on Twitter. And it's using network metrics
to compare the two groups. So here's a figure from the paper
that I've reproduced here. You can see that true news
is being depicted in green. False news is being depicted in red and
you can read explicitly about how they define those things, and where they
get those information in the paper. And one of the things you can see is
over a variety of different metrics that they've computed, there are differences
between true and false news. And there are some alarming ways
in which they're different that I'm going to ask you to
reflect on this week. So the reading reflection for
this week is along those lines, which types of networks are functioning to
power, the findings in the Aral reading? So how are they defining networks? How are they getting those networks and how are they using them
to power these findings? And then follow-up,
I want you to conjecture here. What possible ways can you imagine to
alter the dynamics that are presented in the paper? So I often say that these
are not laws of physics, right? These are not laws of nature. We can, through design, alter and change
the dynamics that we see in these systems. So I'm curious for your conjectures about
how you might change the dynamics that you're seeing in the Aral reading,
and then you could actually posit ways to measure those things as
well in you're reading reflection. The second reading for this week is
by Deen Freelon and colleagues, a professor at UNC looking at Russian
influence operations on Twitter in the context of the American election. So here's a figure from that
paper that I've reproduced, looking at the network formed by
different accounts, interacting. Some of which are owned and
operated by the Russian state, particularly a group called
the Internet Research Agency or the IRA. It seeks to influence American
political discourse and discourse in other parts of the world. All right, so the reading reflection for
this reading, if you choose it, is what network
statistics or signatures might you compute to distinguish the types of
networks written about by Freelon? So thinking about what Freelon
is presenting here and kind of merging it with the way
the approaches taken in the Aral reading, what would you compute and
how do you think that would matter? And how do you think
that would be of value? Why do you think it would work? So I want you to further explain,
why do you think it would work? Not just here's the math behind
how I compute the thing. I also want you to conjecture and think critically about why do
you think that would work? Okay, I hope you enjoy it and
best of luck.
