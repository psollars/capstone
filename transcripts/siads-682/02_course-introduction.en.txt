Hi, welcome to 682
Social Media Analytics. This video is going
to function as an overall overview
of the course, both the major activities, the rationale for the course, and some other everyday issues. You're in social media analytics, that means we're going to be
analyzing the data that come from social platforms
and social media sites. Why are we doing that? I think the answer is twofold. The first reason is that
it's socially important, so what do I mean by that? By that I mean that
it's central to people's lives and particularly
their social lives. I think it's easy to argue these days that
social media sites and platforms have become essential substrates
through which we live our social lives. The second, and I
used to have to argue this harder than I do these days, is that it's societally
important, right? The things that happen on
social media platforms are not just staying there
and living there. They affect our elections, they affect our markets, they affect our politics, it's hard to actually come up with areas of life where they don't interact with
societally important things. This is just some data to
back up those ideas from Pew. Pew is a research organization
that does a lot of usually descriptive
work on what's happening in various
media ecosystems. This one on the left, you're seeing a graph of the percentage of US adults who use at least one
social media site. You can see the general
trajectory is steeply up. Whereas in 2006, maybe 10 percent of US adults are
using one social media site, nowadays it's close
to 80 percent. You can see on the
right that relationship broken down by age band, still the slopes
of those lines are different, I guess a little. But still, you can see that the trend is largely the same, even broken out by age groups. Most Americans these days are using social media
sites frequently. People are using it for
important parts of their lives. This is another Pew
report looking at what Americans are using
social media sites for. This one finds that
about 18 percent of Americans use social
media sites as the primary way they get news. Now, I believe if you change the question to who gets news
through social media, that number goes
up to 60 percent, even if social media is
not the primary vehicle. Now, one of the reasons
that's interesting is because as you see in
the headline here, there can be distinctive facts that come from consuming
your news in that way, which in this report it finds that the
people who do that, primarily are less engaged
and less knowledgeable. That has important
consequences when it comes to, let's say, different types of participation
in civic society. That's one of the
things that you'll read about and think
about in this course is, are there ways that data
science may make that better? Are there ways that
data science can help in these types of problems? I've motivated or at
least explained why I think the class is important
and what we're doing here. Let's think about it in the
context of the program. I've been looking at the MADS
curriculum and thinking, this class is a nice
summative application domain. What do I mean by that? I mean that you've had
a number of courses and a number of different
exposures to different data
science techniques, and now this is serving
as a real-world domain with important problem spaces that you can apply
those things in. Like a lot of important
real-world domains that has varied in both structured
and unstructured data. You'll see quite a lot of heterogeneity in the data that you see in these data sets. Also, you see all these datasets and types of
data-bound together because people are producing it in the act of using
social media sites. What do I mean by that? I mean that these data
are unfolding over time. They're embedded in
networks that people produce tax that they intend
for other people to read, and they're all together
bound together and all connected by the
activity that people are conducting on
these platforms. There are other types of data actually that we're
not going to talk about in this class that are left just because they're
out of scope but, image data, movie data, video data went
by, I guess I mean Audio data, if we're talking about clubhouse
or something, we're going to leave
those out of scope. The list goes on. Let's talk a little bit more nuts
and bolts things here. As you know, this class
is broken down into four separate weeks that unfold. Each week has a topic.
Let me go through each of these topics and the objectives
that we're aiming for. As we go into each week, I'll remind you of what
the objectives are just to orient where we are
and why we're here. Week 1 is just an introduction
to social media data. We're going to talk about the different types of data that are found on social
media platforms. You're going to read about the ethical sensitivities
around these data. These data are not
like every other data. It's not as if there's an
equivalence, in my opinion, between social media data
and water sensor data. Social media data are
typically produced by people with particular social goals
and social constraints. I might write a
message to someone and only expect that
five other people are going to ever read it. What does that mean
for the algorithms that we deploy on those data? What are the right
ethical frameworks and ways to think about that? That's something that I'm
going to introduce you to. Also, we are going
to explore APIs. APIs, often on these platforms, function as a type of
gatekeeper through what you have to go
to access the data. We're going to talk about
those and explore those. Finally, you'll work on understanding the
structure of those data. What do these datasets
actually look like? What are the different
parts of them and how are they connected
to each other. Once we've done that, we're going to visualize and model the patterns
that we find in the data. You're going to load a large
social media corpus that we've already prepared
for practical reasons, and you're going to explore it. You're going to produce
summary statistics over that social media corporates, and you're going to
visualize it along both geographic
and temporal axis. You'll be using a number of the techniques that
you've learned today. As I hinted before, networks and particularly
social networks, form the substrate for most modern social
media platforms. What do I mean by that? The following relationship
on many platforms, the friend relationship
on Facebook. These things seem simple and
they are at a dyadic level, but at the macro level, they expand to make very
complex and large networks, and so we're going
to use the dataset that we have to explore
these networks. We're going to talk about how different networks can arise
from the same dataset. I might develop a network from the following relationship
or I might develop a network from the re-tweeting
relationship. Then we're going to talk
finally and compute different types of network
metrics over a dataset. Things like centrality, etc. Finally, in the last week, we're going to explore the text that you often find
in these platforms. We're going to discuss what types of texts you commonly
find on these platforms, we're going to use topic
modeling to compute topics. We're going to use
sentiment engines to compute sentiment
and we might vary those things over
time and we will also look at tagging
on social media texts. Switching gears a little bit. One thing that you might
find that's different from potentially
other courses you've seen in the program is
that I'm going to make heavy use of something
called a reading reflection. Each week there will be
1-2 readings assigned. Some of them may come
from popular media, some of them may come
from research papers. I'll be expecting
you to read deeply this reading and then respond to a prompt
that I've given you. The prompt might be something like apply the author's vision of ethical frameworks for
data to the Twitter API. I will expect you to write, in response a 3-5
paragraph reading reflection that engages
with that prompt. What do I mean by engage
with that prompt? I mean, I don't want a copy and paste version of the abstract summarized
in your own words. I am expecting you to take a
step beyond that and think through how what you read impacts where we're going
in the dataset here. I've prepared a rubric that I
use in all of my classes to guide you in how to write
this the best way possible. Finally, it's important for me to note that we are
going to be dealing with some societally important topics, but they can sometimes
be difficult topics, and some of the
content in the course actually might be
potentially triggering. I've done my best where
possible to tag the readings, especially tag the readings with particular types of
content that you might encounter so that you
know upfront what to expect. Then also interestingly
in this class that some of that might come
out in the dataset and in the analyses, so it may not just be
limited to the reading. I'll be doing my best to flag those
upfront so that you have a front knowledge of that before you encounter that content. If there's anything
additionally that you'd like me to know
or like me to flag, please reach out and let me know.
