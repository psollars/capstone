Hi, we're going to talk today
about the Week 3 assignment, which is around network. So this is an overview of that
assignment give you a feel for what we're going to be working on
in Jupyter notebook this week. So you've been learning about how networks
form the basis and the substrate for a lot of what happens in social media
sites and social media platforms. They're everywhere, and they really, do undergird what's
happening in these spaces. So in this week's assignment, what we're going to be doing is taking
the data set that we've been working with. We have formed a network for you in
a preprocessing step and we're going as the assignment says here you're seeing
a snippet again of the Jupyter notebook. We're going to be looking at
the network of user mentions and then plotting and
analyzing various network metrics. So we created a network based on
the tweets around a particular account. And then we're providing these statistics
for you to then manipulate with network X. So here's a snippet of
some things you will do. A small snippet, but as to service in
introduction to what you'll be working on programming this week. So you'll be using Network X,
the network library, that you've hopefully seen before,
to low graphs around users and their interactions to then plot and
compute things like centrality. And various various types of centrality. I hope you enjoy it, and I hope you get
some great hairball pictures out of it.
