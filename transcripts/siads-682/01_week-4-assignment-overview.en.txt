Hi, welcome to the week 4,
assignment overview for 682. So, as you've seen before
in this sequence of videos. What we're going to be talking about today
is kind of an orientation to the Jupiter notebook assignment for this week, which
is the final assignment in this class. And is revolves around text and the textual things that people
put into social platforms. So, let's take a quick look. So this is again a snippet of the Jupiter
notebook that you'll be working with. I have the objectives listed at the tops
of the week 4 objective is to use sentiment analysis and
topic modeling on social media data. So that's what you'll be looking at, today is taking these tweets from
this corpus that we've used. And using textual techniques that you've
become familiar with in other courses to model and understand what's happening
in the social media corpus. So, an example here, would be finding
topics and plotting topics over time. We're providing some helper methods and
some other methods that you need to fill in, where you will then do things
like compute topic coherence. Visualized topics over time as illustrated
here in this figure that you'll produce and try to learn in for
things from that, I hope you enjoy it.
