Hi and welcome to the first
reading orientation for 682. So the point of these videos, you'll see
four of them that are forthcoming, is to kind of orient you to the readings that
we're going to be exploring in this class. As I said in the overview of the course, I feel like at this point
in a graduate program, one of the best ways to come
to understand a field that's still kind of at the edge is
to read important readings and then interact with them in a dialogue,
which is what I'm going to ask you to do. So just to recap: the goals,
the learning objectives, the goals of this week's part of
the course are to understand the different types of data that you can get from
social platforms to two understand the ethical implications and
sensitivity around those data. These data are not the same as as
every other type of data out there. They're made by people. The data are made by people who
are interacting with others who may or may not know that, or may or may not
understand that, what we're doing in this class is actually possible
in the first place. We're going to talk about social APIs and how they function as
the gateway to those data. And then, especially in the assignment for
this week, you'll be looking at and
exploring the structure of data. You have two readings, and I guess a reading in a site that
I'd like you to explore this week. The first is a piece first published
almost five years ago in Wired magazine. The author is Michael Zimmer,
who's a professor and an ethicist. And the piece is about a data set from
OKCupid, the dating site OkCupid. And this is a study that was built
around that it discusses a number of the sensitivities that despite
being published five years ago, I think still apply. Actually, in a lot of the areas that
we're going to work in this semester and if you continue in this
space going forward. So an example of the type of idea that I'd
like you to engage with is quoted here. So Zimmer says, for those concerned
about privacy, research ethics and the growing practice of publicly
releasing data sets this logic of quote. But the data is already public. Is an all too familiar friend used to
gloss over thorny ethical concerns. This is something you hear
quite a bit in this area, which is that people put it on Twitter. They knew it was public at
the time that they wrote it. Shouldn't I be able to do
anything I want with it? That's a really interesting question and I think one that I want you
to engage with this week. One of the two available reading
reflections is how might some of these issues outlined by Zimmer arise
when you're collecting and analyzing data from Twitter? So I want you to take the ideas that
Zimmer is putting forth in this piece and I want you to think about how those might
interact with you and people like you analyzing data from Twitter in
the ways we might do in this class. The second thing that I'd
like you to interact with and it's not so much a reading as it is a set
of docs is the twitter API reference. So this is a screenshot from that website. You can find the links
in the course page. So if you've never used in API like this,
you definitely have used some API before in the form, at minimum
of, right, of a python library. But this API is a network API that
provides access to Twitter data. So if you're an authenticated consumer of
the API, you can access certain parts of the Twitter data ecosystem at certain
rates under certain permission structure. And this API is in some ways similar
to something like a python library, but in some ways different in that it
functions as a gateway to those data and enforces boundaries on
who can access what. So what I'd like you to do is
explore this pretty deeply and understand what data
are made available to you. In what ways? How can you access them? What can you access? And that's partly built into the reading
reflection prompt for this thing. So the question is: describe four specific types of data you could use
to collect with twitter API, and then what are two possible ethical
questions that might arise from those specific data and thinking through okay,
what might Zimmer say, if Zimmer we're looking at the Twitter API
and the specific pages, right? So if I'm looking at specifically
the get on profile data, what can I get? And what might Zimmer say about what I
could get and how I should treat it? I feel like this is an important kind of
table setting part of the class where we think about you know what
data we have access to. What should we do with it? The power that we have in the kind
of methods we can apply to it. So that's what I'm
asking you to reflect on and interact with this week's readings.
