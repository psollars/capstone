Hi. I'm Eric Gilbert. I'm the instructor for this class. I wanted to take a minute just
to introduce myself here. I'm an associate professor here
in the school of information. I also have a courtesy
appointment in computer science. I have been at the school of
information for about three years now. Before that, I was an assistant professor at
Georgia Tech in the College of Computing. A few things you should know about me
one is that I'm coming to you from my snowy bunker and
a month 11 of the pandemic. So, you may see my dog. You may hear my young son who is
doing home school from the house, but all that's nice, I suppose. I adore coffee and so you might see me
drinking coffee throughout these videos. Also something that I'll talk about
more is that I have a new instructional philosophy that's more participatory and
less oriented Iran consumption. So I've tried to build that into this
course as much as I possibly can, so you may see that come up through
the assignments and through the videos. So a little bit about my research,
because I think it informs this class. My research is very close to
the topic of this classes. You'll see, I think,
as we go through the course. So just a few kind of snippets of research
that I've done that might be helpful to kind of orient you to who I am and
where I'm coming from. This is you're seeing a diagram
here from a paper that we published a couple of years ago,
that is using data science and AI techniques to stream comments that
are coming in on Reddit Live and then pipe them into a moderation system
that allows moderators in subreddit, which are sub communities on reddit,
to take pre configured actions. So we used a lot of kind of back end data
science and human centered methods in conjunction to build this system
that works live on Reddit. And it was deployed in a community of over
10 million active registers and used for over a year. So it's called cross mod. You can go and
read the paper that's side of there. If you're interested in more another
example, that's a paper that's on the syllabus, for this course is the paper
we wrote last year called Still Out There, which is about identifying
Russian trolls on Twitter. So we know that the Russian state used
Twitter to try to influence the election. We have a data set of those things,
and we're able to build models that distinguish those actors from other quote
unquote normal or everyday accounts. And the idea was to inform
policy at Twitter and also keep people safe on the Internet. All right, so I look forward to
having you in this class, and I'm really excited that you're here. Thanks.
