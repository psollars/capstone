Hi, and welcome to
week two's overview for the programming
assignment in 682. So in the week 1 assignment, you were asked to just obtain and explore a dataset from a
social media platform, to understand the structure, to get up to speed. You're getting up to speed
for this week's assignment, which asks you primarily to visualize various attributes
of the data through different lenses and
through different filters. For example, you are
seeing here a fragment of the notebook that you'll be doing for this
week's assignment. We'll be taking the entire
corpus we have from Twitter, not just fragments of it
as in the last assignment, and you'll be visualizing that corpus along a
variety of dimensions. You will be doing things like
creating these histograms of the tweet volume at different points through
different lenses. You're seeing a snippet here of using visualization
frameworks and pandas to manipulate the data frames
that we set up in week 1 and create these
visualizations as output. The things you do in this week's assignment
will be making use of the general pandas and general visualization skills
that you've learned in previous courses to apply to the specific dataset in
these specific ways. I wish you the best
and good luck.
