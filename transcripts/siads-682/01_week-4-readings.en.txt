Okay, hi. Let's get into the last set of readings
for this class, which is about text on social media platforms, obviously a common
design factor on these platforms. Okay so, so far you've looked at kind of
the temporal dimensions, you've looked at different patterns of social media data,
and recently you looked at networks. This week we're going to look at text and
we're going to use techniques that you've learned to date in other
courses around mining and manipulating text in the context of text
that appears on social media platform. The objectives for this week as I've
reproduced here are to describe the various types of text commonly
found on social media platforms. To compute topics over time on a social
dataset, do the same for sentiment and also tagging. And then to think about the ways in which
these things can be used to learn about communities and inform different types
of judgments including design and policy recommendations. And that's what you'll be looking
at in these readings this week, which will be prompting you to think about
the ways that these things can be kind of all holistically brought
together to learn and do things. First, both readings are by my lab this week.
So the first reading by a group of my students and other collaborators
is called the Internet's Hidden Rules: An Empirical Study of Reddit Norm
Violations at Micro, Meso, and Macro Scales. And in this paper we use a large Reddit
corpus to infer and group the types of rules that kind of implicitly exist on
the large scale discussion site, Reddit. So here's a figure that I've reproduced
from that paper where one of the things this is showing is the way that clustering
is being used in conjunction with topic modeling and open coding. Which is, a human's actually going in and
labeling what they see in order to derive what we call norms, which are rules
that people know they shouldn't break or they might be sanctioned. So the reading reflection for this week is kind of along the lines of
this papers' general direction, which is how does text provide insight into
the inner workings of online communities? What are the possible pitfalls in analyzing text obtained from
social media platforms? So I think this paper actually provides a
number of interesting kind of case studies in the ways that those things might help a
lot and kind of pitfalls to watch out for. And I think you can actually
find those in this paper. You can link parts of this paper
actually to other experiences and information you have seen or read about. The final paper for
this class is called Still Out There: Modeling and Identifying Russian
Troll Accounts on Twitter, another piece from my lab
from a couple of years ago. This is kind of connected to the Freelon
reading from last week where we looked at identifying accounts
used by the IRA on Twitter to influence operations on the site. So this is a figure I've produced in
the paper again, a flow chart indicating basically the overall research methodology
that's presented in this paper. You'll see that it progresses from data
collection to classifier construction, etc, etc, and
finally arriving at human evaluation. So there's similar patterns in these
two papers in that I like these papers as a kind of summative project idea in
this class because they show the - and showcase - the entire pipeline basically,
and how you might put various
pieces of this together. So the final reflection [COUGH] reading
reflection, excuse me, kind of asks you to do some higher order thinking about the Im
paper and ask yourself, what new features might you add to the Im research in
order to make a better classifier? So one of the things you're doing in the
kind of data science curriculum is asking yourself, how can you build better
models to distinguish something? At least that's part of what
we're training you to do. And oftentimes that might
include getting access to data that you might not have
otherwise included in a data set. So I'm asking you to reflect on
that based on your experiences and what you've read so far, and
then subsequently give me explanations for why you would add those and
how you would test their effectiveness. So I'm asking you to again,
draw upon the reading, draw upon things you've brought
from your own personal experiences, other classes that you've done to
kind of bring these all together. Thanks.
And I hope you enjoyed it.
