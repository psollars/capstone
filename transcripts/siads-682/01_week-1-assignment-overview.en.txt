Hi, welcome to a discussion of
the first week's assignment in 682. Okay, so I'm just going to go over kind of
the purpose of the assignment, what you're going to learn, what I'm hoping that
you'll do and the purpose of all of this. So right now you're looking at part of a
snippet of the first Jupiter notebook for this class. As we've discussed in previous videos and
you've been reading about, the purpose of the first week is to kind
of orient you to the ideas of some of the principles ideas,
structures of social data. So the types of data, the ways platforms, store it etc etc in addition
to ethical considerations and working with such data and then what
the structure of those data look like. So that's what this assignment is about. This assignment, the first week's
assignment, is really just kind of getting up to speed with obtaining,
using and working with social data. So for the most part of this class will
operate with a pre assembled in cash to data set that we've assembled for
your use. So you're seeing part of that snippet
here in this slide where what we're doing is taking Jason formatted objects
that we've stored in a separate place and reading them into data frames and
panels that we can manipulate. So there will be a variety of tasks around
just kind of taking data that in the form from which we get it from Twitter. And bringing it into a form where
we can work with it in Jupiter and do various things to and
do various transformations so which will feed into the kind
of later weeks assignments. So, I hope you enjoy it and good luck.
