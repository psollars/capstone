So, let's talk about the project,
overall, the goal of the project, is to give you the opportunity,
to bring your unique interests, creativity, and ingenuity,
to our data world. Demonstrating your ability, to apply
the skills and concepts that you've learned in the courses so far,
to real data sets of your choice. >> In particular, tour project should show
off your ability to take at least two data sets, that have very different formats and
or access methods and clean manipulate and combine them. In order to extract,
a useful by product, in other words, in a sense of very new data set, something more that you could have gotten
from either the data sets by themselves. The manipulation could involve, filtering,
format conversion, handling, missing or noisy data, matching records from one data
source, with corresponding records, and the other and so on. You must make significant
use of programming tools, that we've covered in the prerequisite
courses, you'll also be expected to demonstrate your ability to
visually explore your data. >> Now we're going to encourage you,
strongly encourage you, to work in teams of two, or three, which in our experience yield superior
experiences and results, right? You get the ability to collaborate with
other people, to cooperate with others, but you're not in such a big team
that you can sort of hide, okay? So, it's a very visible,
yet powerful environment, now will facilitate the team formation,
although we're encouraging you to self organize and slack,
advertise your interests. Say, this is what I'm interested in,
anyone else? And odds are someone's going to try and
say yeah, I'd like to work with, you know. >> The teaching team is also going to
work with you to help guide you through the early stages of your
proposal formulation. If you you're unsure about what
data sets you might want to use, we can help you find something
that you're interested in, and that would form
the basis of a good project. Some of you might have data that you
can access from another context, such as your workplace. However, that data must be public, and it must be accessible by all members of
the class, including the teaching team. With no additional licensing waivers,
or other technical, or legal restrictions on accessing the data. >> Now, before you start
work on the actual project, you'll need to write a short
project proposal, and that's going to be based on a template,
that we give you. This is meant to be a high level summary,
and doesn't need to contain
technical details or code. You can refine your project
goals later if necessary, as your project progresses,
we're going to ask you to check in with your faculty
mentor if you're going to do that. Submitting the proposal early in the
course, is intended to get you thinking about the questions, and
data sets that you might be interested in. And how those might be addressed with
the tools that you have been exposed to, in the program so far. Now, some of you, may have already
taken some more advanced courses, maybe something on machine learning. Maybe classification supervised,
unsupervised learning, causal inference, or
something like that, that's great. But say that from milestone two, or the
capstone course, what you need to show us, is that you can first of all, define
a problem, second of all, source data. Third, clean, manipulate, and combine, different data sources into a new
data set forth, leverage visual and analytic techniques that you've acquired
in prerequisite courses to gain insights. And finally, number five, communicate
those results in an effective manner. >> You'll also be asked to review
each other's project proposals, it's got two main purposes. The first, is that provides additional
feedback on your proposed projects, above, and beyond what the teaching
team provides you. Second, it also provides you with
the opportunity to be inspired by each other's work. The process of peer review in this
course is modeled on scientific or academic peer review. And please note that you will be
awarded credit for coursework, for providing your feedback, and
a minimum of two other projects. You're assigned score for the proposal,
is not going to be based however, on the feedback that you receive,
it's just the feedback you give. >> Now, once you have your feedback and
you've provided feedback to others, you'll submit your proposal to
the teaching team for approval. And once you get that approval, you'll
be clear to work, on the project for the remaining duration of the course. So, how do you complete this part
of the course, successfully? Pick data that you're passionate about,
you're going to be spending a lot of time with it, so you've got to be engaged
with what it is, in order to do well. Take some time to dig deeply and
reflect on what generally inspires you, then try to find data on it. Stuck, reach out to your peers, and
to the teaching team to help you, odds are that someone will have ideas
that you'll be able to leverage. Finally, don't freak out about this,
it's designed to be fun, and to give you a chance,
to take the skills that you've learned, in the courses you've completed so far,
and apply them to real world scenarios. Good luck, and remember, that we're
here to help support you as best we can. [CROSSTALK]
>> And talking about being here, just to let you know, right now we're
going to move away from this camera here. We are on the eighth floor of the Hatcher
building, and you are looking south, out towards the La quadrangle. And if you can see the black and,
further on to the southwest, that is known as the Big house, or
the or Michigan stadium, take care
