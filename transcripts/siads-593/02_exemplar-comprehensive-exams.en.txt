Hi, my name is Chris [INAUDIBLE] and
I want to give you some idea about what's going to happen in your
comprehensive oral exam. What we've done is, we've assembled videos
from three previous students who have done the exam, and who have graciously given
us permission to use their recordings. Now I'm not going to show you the entire
exam for any one of these students. I'm going to give you a sense of what it
feels sort of the logistics around it, what you'll hear from
the examination team. I'll give you some idea about how
students responded to questions, how they use different support tools,
like notebooks effectively. And then just give you
a sense of what it's like. In this first segment, you'll hear me as the adjudicator
in the process, welcome a student. Just ask him some questions to sort of
get them comfortable with the situation. And then I'll turn things over
towards the end to my colleague, Anthony White who's
the examiner in this situation. >> Hallo
>> How are you? >> Fine. >> You know what, we have communicated
in slack a whole bunch of times and I do not know how to pronounce your name. >> [LAUGH] My name is [INAUDIBLE] okay. >> Okay, that's very easy, ken, I think you know roughly
how this is going to work. This is your comprehensive exam, and right
now there are two of us and one of you, that's not going to be the case for
your exam. What's going to happen in a minute is,
I'm going to adopt my role of adjudicator. What that means is, I have I have
the rubric printed out beside me, and my job today as the adjudicator
is to listen to the conversation that you have with my colleague and
friend, Anthony white. So, what I'm going to do in a minute
is I'm going to drop my video, I'm going to mute my microphone and I'm going to just listen to how
things unfold with you and Anthony. And with that,
I'll turn things over to Anthony and he can describe the rest
of the process to you. >> Now once I've done my
part as the adjudicator, I turn things over to the examiner, in
this case, Anthony White, who will reveal to the student the question and then ask
the student for his initial response. >> All right then, hi. >> Hi. >> It's good to see you. >> So my handy iPhone will
serve as our official clock. And of course you're probably wondering,
so what is it that we're
going to be talking about? And the topic that was randomly
selected for you is topic number one. And that's the one I
call the client topic, in other words you have to imagine
a scenario in which you have a client etc. So, what we're going to do is,
I will start the clock. Then I'm going to read that topic to you, which will give you just a few
moments to orient yourself to that. Then you going to breathe life into
the conversation five minutes or so, set up the scenario etc. And then following that, I'll pose
a series of questions, and you and I will just talk, and
together we will run the clock out, okay? >> Let's have a listen to what kin
has to say as his opening response to that question. My client is I can imagine
is Prime Minister or office in Singapore. And my role is a senior data
scientist in covid task force of Department of Health
in Singapore government. And the task is to analyze
on how public policy like vaccination policies mask
face covering policies or other lockdown policies like
gathering restrictions, how they affect the trend or
number of confirmed cases and death. And I think first of all
the practice questions to myself here is what would the data
science results be useful And I think the data science result would
affect the government policy and lockdown versus which coupled to
the well being of the general public. And so we need to consider
consequences of the data science result or
analysis like who will be affected and how the data science results
can benefit to the society. And it is important because
normally as a civil servant or public servant, our work should
be towards the best interests of the general public rather than any
other individual or senior officers in the government including
the prime minister or the president. So who belongs to a political party. So we have to recourse years
of the analysis results or data science results being
distorted by political bias. >> Once the introductory remarks are over, that gives the examiner chance to
open up the floor for more questions. So let's listen to what Anthony
asks of kin as a first question. >> That's a nice introduction. Very good. I was going to say I'm going to
pretend that I'm the prime minister. But I'm not going to go quite,
I'm not going to go quite there yet. I'll just pretend I'm in
his office in their office. And so the the first question I
wanted to ask you about is the so this data set that you examine,
what does this, what story does the Singapore data tell? Did you get a chance to,
to look at the Singapore data? >> Yes, of course. Well I actually compared
some city which is very similar to Singapore,
like Hong kong and Taipei and Tokyo, which is the four
major east asian cities with similar very similar culture and
wealthy of them sharing the chinese culture because
of the of the three cities. The majority of Chinese. Okay, and what I see is that with the face covering policy has high
correlation of the, I mean the high negative
value of correlation coefficient to the daily
new confirmed cases. >> Now that was a nice response. And so Anthony pushes a little
bit further and says, hey, just to be clear here,
you actually did more work. You actually compared things and
that's actually an opener for kin to share some of the work that
he did in some of the notebooks. So have a look to see how effective
it is to share notebooks at the right time during the conversation. >> So, so what you're telling me is you
didn't just look at the Singapore data because looking at the Singapore
data in isolation, it'll tell you, it'll give you some story, but
it's actually as you point out, it's important to look at it
in a comparative perspective. So I really like that aspect and an idea. I just was wondering like you know, use
the word highly You said high correlation. But we'll just say highly correlated. And so, I wanted to sort of dig in and
understand. So ,what numbers are we talking about? And then, of course, if I'm part of
the Prime Minister's office, right? And so, you got to talk to me before you
get to talk to the [LAUGH] Prime Minister. >> [LAUGH]. >> Yeah, and so, am his Chief of Staff. And so I want to know what this means,
actually. What does highly correlated,
actually, mean? What does that mean for
us in this city state? >> Okay, well,
this is my Singapore dataset. Yeah, I wrote it out. And I create some new columns
that are like daily new confrontations-
>> That's a really nice answer. Now, Ken actually went on and showed us
some more visualizations that he used. Now, this is kind of interesting
because he bridged questions here. And that's certainly allowed. But it was part of a bigger story. So, it was a really effective
technique that he used. And I want to share that
with you right now. >> Okay,
I think one of the interesting thing is to compare similar
cities in the same region. So that we can have more knowledge about how the policies affect each of the city in terms of the daily confirmed, right? And, again,
I have computed some new columns here. So that I can use a live chart to
compare different cities here. Maybe be taxes, the franchise is small. The blue one is Hong Kong. The orange one is Singapore. And the red one is Tokyo. >> Now that's all we want to
show you from Qin's exam. I want to, now, take another example. This is from a student
whose name is Trish. And Trish was given
a different question than Ken. But you'll get an idea of how this works. Again, a little bit of
showing you the process. Here, Anthony Jovi is the adjudicator. So he does the introduction. And I'm the examiner for Trish. >> So I'm going to pass it over to Chris. And then he's going to
read you your question. Which was randomly selected for you. And then pass the ball to you. So can kick off into your opening
presentation, opening remarks. >> Cool.
>> Thank you Anthony. Trish, how are you? >> I'm good, how are you doing? [LAUGH]
>> Am good. You'll be happy when this is all over. I can tell. >> [LAUGH]
>> It's like just get the question. Okay, so the question that has come up to
our through the miracle of random number generation. Is the split, apply, combine one. That's question number four. >> Okay.
>> So what I'm going to do is I'm going to read through that prompt. Just to give you, an extra five or
10 seconds to orient your thoughts. Then I'll turn it over to you. >> Okay.
>> To give me your introductory blurb. And then the rest of the time,
I'll start my stopwatch here. The rest of the time we
will spend talking about. What I think you think is
interesting about the question. Okay, sound good? >> Sound good. >> Good, the prompt reads as follows. The split apply combine data analysis
pattern identified by Hadley Wickham. In a 2011 paper published in
the Journal of Statistical Software describes a strategy for analyzing data. Describe the pattern and how it has
been implemented in various libraries. Discuss how the split, apply,
combine pattern can be used to glean insights from
the COVID-19 data hub data set. Provide at least two examples
of its use from your exploratory analysis of the data. And with that,
I'm going to turn it over to you. >> Cool, so, yeah, the split apply
combine strategy is really where you break down a problem
into manageable pieces. Operate on each of those
pieces independently. And then pull them all back together. And split, apply, combine, like you
mentioned, is definitely most commonly used in the manipulation, data cleaning
phase, exploratory data analysis. Which is what I used for this project. And Pandas team, actually,
implemented the split, apply combine strategy using group by. And so, basically, group by allows
you to split the dataset into groups. And then they apply step of this. You can do many methods. You could do aggregation,
apply transformations and filtrations. And aggregations, really,
are about summary statistics. So say, you wanted to compute the sum or
the mean for each of the groups that
you you split into. Transformations are about custom functions that you might want to
apply to a specific group. >> Now, I cut Trish off there. Why I just cut the recording there, because we then talk a little
bit more about filtration. And that allowed me to go deeper
into that specific topic. Because it's something that I felt that
she was comfortable talking about. And that I could push a little bit more
on the edges of her understanding. Let's listen to hear what she has to
say when I asked her about filtration. >> But
I don't think there's a specifically. But I also will say, for
the other example, doing a filter first. Not doing a group by at all. That is something that I did do also
in my exploratory data analysis. Just because, for example,
if I just wanted to filter out the states. I could have just filtered out. And only said if it's in this list of
states, then those are the states I want. That would be like filtering out
all states that aren't US states. I don't know if there's really a pro or
con to either. I think the only benefit is, when you
filter on the bigger data set, you might be keeping more columns and stuff
like that than you might actually need. If you do a group by, and then filter
smaller, you could kind of shrink down the information that you're
actually keeping in that new data frame. That group by would return. >> Now, the next segment is kind of fun. Because it's one of those
cases where the student and the examination team are sort of aligned
and we're thinking along the same lines. So a question that I ask,
actually, you can see the smile appear on Trish's face as
she's very comfortable with this topic. And then launches into
a more detailed description. Or a more detailed answer rather
to the question that I asked. The world map. And you split all your
data according to country. Your apply is actually selecting a color
that's encoding some sort of variable. And then the combine is putting all
the countries together in the world map. >> [CROSSTALK]
>> That's one of the exact visualizations I created for two. Yeah, I see. >> I made a bubble map plot. >> Maybe we should do this all over again. Get you-
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I know. I think you'd like my little graph for
that one [LAUGH]. >> So, that's what I want to
show you from Tricia's exam. The third student who gave us an exemplary
performance on the comprehensive oral exam is Ric Vic. I want to show you this initial clip. Because there was some technical
issues right at the beginning. And we resolved it. So, if something weird happens,
we can't hear you. Don't panic. We'll solve it. And then we'll move on. Again, this should now be starting to be
familiar to you with the structure of it. But we'll show you the intro
to this segment, as well. Ritvik, how are you? >> Sorry, hey guys, well, how you doing? >> Yeah, we're doing well. >> Thank you for making time to
interview me at this time, that's great. >> Not a problem, so, I'm Anthony White. I'm here with Chris Teplovs and together, we are going to participate
with you in this discussion. Having said that,
my role is that of adjudicator. What I will principally be doing is
observing taking notes and helping score. In the main, your conversation is going to
be a one on one with Chris, all right. So you don't have to worry about the two
of us, like lobbying questions at you throughout the accessible
portion of the conversation. All right, so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to turn off my video, turn off my audio and listen and
turn everything over to Chris. >> Now,
Ritvik got the visualization question and he elected to share his screen again,
not required, but available to you. And I want to show you how easily he
talked to the work that he did and also how he gave us evidence that he
did do a lot of work above and beyond the sort of the minimum requirements
that is one or two visualizations. But I want you to have a listen
to this is a longer segment to give you an idea of what it
might look like as it unfolds. >> Can you see my screen? >> Yes
>> Okay, great. So, I created a bunch of visualizations is
to prepare for this particular question. And as part of that visualization,
I've created some bar graphs, basically trying to get the number of
confirmed COVID cases for each country. So I took a stop shot of
the COVID data set at the country level and
tried to analyze [COUGH] That data because I want to
take a global picture of what's happening around the world. So that data set was quite rich, provided surprisingly much more
information than I really needed for my analysis such as population was
I didn't expect that to see there. But it was really handy to see
population in the data set, which I later used to calculate
some some interesting ratio maybe the ratio of new cases
over total population. So I tried to kind of
get the total new cases by country in a bar graph
here that you see right here. And then I was not really impressed and
kind of convinced with this paragraph. So I tried to, because there are so many
countries in the world like 200 plus and this doesn't really
represent it quite well. So I looked into top 20 top 30
countries sorted by number of confirmed cases to get a clearer understanding
of what's happening in the world at the moment in terms of COVID. And then I kind of plotted a scatter
plot as well using plot li library. Which kind of made this whole
experience quite interacted. So I used date as on my X axis and the number of confirmed
cases on the Y axis. And then I actually used the color
encoding that comes as part of the plot library. And I used administrative area level one
which basically represents the name of the country in the dataset. So have the nice breakdown
of that data set. But even though with this approach,
I kind of have to take a trend line. I can see what's happening where but
I just have to hover on the line to understand which countries what
especially down at the bottom right there are lots of lines and
scatter plots were lapping. So I decided to kind of filter on key
countries that I wanted to focus on. So I looked into India, France,
Brazil and the United States >> Now Ritvik was doing really well and the questions were getting harder and
harder. So if you are the better you do,
the harder the questions get. But I want to give you just a sense
of how this might come about. So he was giving me some
great visualizations. I saw that he did some coral plants and
I asked him one question about that. I'm not going to give you his answer but
I'm going to give you a sense of the question that I asked
>> Let's go map. Let's take a look at the map and what I want to ask about on the map is, can you identify sources of
bias in this visualization? >> Okay, so those are three
former students of Milestone 1, who we felt did really well on
their comprehensive oral exam. And we wanted to give you these little
vignettes, these snippets from their exams to give you a sense of how
things unfold during the exam. Now, some of the questions
are the same for this iteration. But the data sets different, so we're not
using the same data set that we used for these exams. So, of course, your visualizations,
your talk, your clients, whatever, are going to be different, but you get
a sense of how it's going to unfold and hopefully that will lower the stress. All you have to do is prepare good
answers for the questions and we'll have a great conversation.
