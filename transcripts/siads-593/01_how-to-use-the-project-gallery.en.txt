In this video, I will walk you through the
process of uploading your team's reports to the project gallery and leaving
comments on your classmates reports. This will be in addition to submitting
your final projects zip file to Submit Final Project section in Week 7. So after you've submitted your zip
file under Submit Final Project, you'll click into
the project gallery tool. You will agree to use the tool
responsibly and then open the tool. When it first is launched, you will be
able to see all of your classmates reports that have already been uploaded. I want to highlight that this gallery is
only available to the instructors and students who are in this
run of milestone one. It is not accessible to
anyone outside the course. To upload your own submission, find
Upload Submission on the left hand side. And then you can include the title of your
project, which I'll just use title for examples sake and
then your name and your team name. So for example, if it's a team that's
just me, it would be Emily Sartorius. Ad then on Coursera it would be 01 or
whatever number you have and then your team's unique name. So S-I-R-T-O-R-E. It's my unique name. After that, you can select the attachments
that you would like to include. So here you'll do choose File, select the PDF of your report. You will only upload
the PDF of your report. If you try to upload the zip file,
it will not work. So please just upload the PDF. And then if you have any other links,
like you get a repository or a dashboard, you may include it in optional links,
so that way your peers can see it. Once you have uploaded and
attached everything that you needed to, please click Publish. And your final project will be available
for all of your classmates under all course submissions and
now your classmates can comment on it. In week 8, you're expected to
give feedback on two reports and to do this, you'll be using the comment
feature in the project gallery. To do this, find the report you
would like to provide feedback to. View and
read the assets within the report. So I will choose this one for
Anthony White. I would be able to read the reports, view
some of the assets that were included. And then after that I would be
able to provide some thoughtful feedback in the comments section below. You'll do this by typing
your feedback in this comment section and
then clicking Post comment. It is recommended that in this project, in the project guidelines that you
review the same reports that you have reviewed in the proposal in
section in week 3 of the course. So you're welcome to review and provide
feedback on more than just two proposals, but it's expected that you do
provide feedback on two proposals. And you'll be doing that
through this comment section. Once you post the comment,
it will be available for everyone to read.
