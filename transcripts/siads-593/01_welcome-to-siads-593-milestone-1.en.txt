Hi, welcome to Milestone 1. I'm Chris Teplovs. >> And I'm Anthony Whyte. >> And we thought we'd give you this
little brief video to introduce you to us and to the course. So what I want to do is just give us an
opportunity to tell you a little bit about ourselves, and then we'll talk a little bit about
the major components of the course. >> I've got a lot to say about myself,
but I'm going to keep it short, and just focus on my relationship
with the University of Michigan. I have worked for
the University since the year 2004, started off as an open-source developer. I joined the school of information as
a member of the faculty in 2019, and I've been involved with Milestone 1
since its inception in the year 2020. >> Thanks, so
my background is all over the place. I started off as a freshwater biologist, I transitioned over into
educational technology. My doctorate is from the University
of Toronto in curriculum teaching and learning, so I focus on teaching. I've been teaching for
just over 30 years now, so this course is one of the favorite
things that I do during the year. I also teach residentially in the School
of Information, I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in data science, but
I want to focus now on the course. >> There's an important aspect of this
course that I'd really like to emphasize straight from the start and I guess,
if I was going to use a single term, I'd call it communication. Now, in your previous MADs courses,
all the prerequisites leading up to Milestone 1, you have for
the most part engaged with assignments and videos, perhaps met with your
instructors via office hours, etc. Well, there'll be fewer videos
I should say for Milestone 1. But one of the aspects of the course
that we'd really like to emphasize is that the instructional team,
which actually will include a number of other members of
the faculty besides Chris and myself, that we make sure that we are in
near-constant communication. Obviously, Slack is the standard
of the default communication channel that we'll use. But we would also as you'll see as we talk
a little bit more about the course and its deliverables,
you will be working with individual faculty members in the project
aspects of this course. And communicating on a regular
basis via ad hoc meetings, regular scheduled meetings, Slack DMs,
and as well as office hours. We really emphasize that you take
that opportunity to actually spend time talking to members of
the instructional team about your work, both within the context of this course and
outside it as a data scientist. >> The other thing, thanks, and the other
thing that I think this course for me anyways, it's about time, your pace in
the MADs program, depending on how long you're taking for the entire degree,
but it's pretty hectic, right? The courses are four weeks long. There's usually an assignment
due every week. Now, we have assignments in this course
too, and we'll talk a little bit more about those, and
they do come along at a pretty quick pace. But really what we want to do,
as part of giving you this experience, is carve out enough time for you to do
a number of things to synthesize all that material from the prerequisite courses. So we want you to go back and
review all your notes. We're going to incentivize that, right, with a couple of the assignments
that we have here. It's also a chance to,
as I said, synthesize things, to put things together, right? How do ethics play into data manipulation? And how does visualization concern
itself with being a data scientist? So I want you to start thinking
across courses, right? We're going to break down those silos,
those artificial silos between courses, and get you to run across the curriculum. And finally,
it's time to apply your knowledge, and we're going to give you an opportunity
to do that in the project, right? So you're going to take all these
techniques that you've learned so far and not apply all of them, right? We don't want to hold tour de force
of all of that you can do, but we want you to pick the right
techniques and really go deep. So this is a chance for you to take your
interests and put them front and center. Now, it's going to be challenging, right? We're going to throw some
challenges at you, but we hope that you'll be
able to rise to these and really take advantage of this course where
you have a lot of instructor contact time. As Anthony just said,
with that communication, right, it's about opening up that
communication for a lot of you. This might be the first time that you'll
have an opportunity to actually have a conversation with the faculty member. So that's kind of the big picture
of what we want to expose you to. >> Now, playing back on that
earlier thing that I mentioned about the focus that we
place on communication. One of the major deliverables for
this course, and there are two major deliverables, Chris will talk about
the second one in just a moment, but the first one is an oral examination,
we call it the comprehensive oral exam. Now, for some of you, you may be thinking,
I have never done an oral exam in my life. What are you guys forcing on me? The way that we would like you to think
about this is the oral exam will be structured. It's a 20 minute accessible conversation,
and I want to emphasize that word conversation, so
we're talking 20 minutes here. And be surprised,
20 minutes will run pretty fast. We will lay out for you a scenario,
we'll set up a context. We're going to give you
a dataset that you will explore. And then we'll also give
you a number of topics, which you will utilize that data and
your exploration of it to ground yourself in such a way that when we have that
conversation, you will be able to see that conversation with explicit examples
drawn from your exploration of the data. The topics themselves will
reflect the prerequisite courses that you have previously taken up
to this Milestone 1 experience. The idea here is not simply that you
will have an opportunity in a very real sense to communicate results out
to member of the instructional team. But this examination over this oral
conversation will give you a chance to actually reflect on all of
the work that you have taken and performed up to the Milestone experience. Now, numbers of students have reported
to us that as they lead up to taking the exam, there could be
some anxieties associated with it. But once you get yourself beyond
that hump, overwhelmingly, these students tell us that they really
appreciate the fact that they were given an assignment that allowed them to
reflect on their previous work. Because as Chris said, the velocity,
in which you have previously had to operate under in order to
work through these 30 day classes, has kept you running at
pretty high throttle. This examination experience of this
conversation, as we really like to refer to it, will give you an opportunity to
reflect back on where you've been and where you find yourself today. >> So that's half of the course, right? That comp exam and again,
it's a conversation, it's an exam, it's meant to be affirming that. Yeah, you kind of know what you're
talking about what we're looking for, and we'll talk about this in another video is
evidence that we're talking to someone who is becoming a data scientist. There's another major component of
the course, and that's the project. The project is this eight week endeavor,
so it takes advantage of the fact that this course is twice as long as any other
MADs course that you've taken so far. So you've got eight weeks
to work on a project, and where the project differs from
the comp exam is number of ways. But one of them is that in the comp exam,
we're going to give you a dataset and we're going to give you some questions. The project requires you to extend that
even further by choosing an appropriate dataset, actually a couple of datasets,
we're going to make it put data together. And so there's the fact that you've got
data and you're also going to have to come up with your own questions,
now how's that going to work? You're going to be working in teams. So yeah, there's a collaboration
component, that's really important. We'll cover the details of how that's
all going to work in our project video. But that's the major difference,
this protracted effort. So it's eight weeks long,
there's a proposal, you're going to read other people's
proposals and comment on those. You're going to use that to
actually inform your idea. Hey, that was a great
idea that I read about. You might try something similar,
then you're going to go on and actually do the work, so the work is going to be
conducted over a number of weeks, you put together the final report and your notebooks that were
interested in your code as well. And then what's going to happen is you're
going to share your projects out, and we're going to use a different tool for
that. But you're going to share and you're going to comment on
other people's projects. Because one of the things that I love
about this course is that ability to get that diversity of interests,
that's really interesting to me. And I think I want to share that with you, like we want to share that joy of
finding other people's insights. It's really cool stuff that you and
your colleagues are doing in the course, so those are the two major components. >> Yeah, and
the second component of our course, besides the communication component, each
project team will be assigned a mentor, and you will be meeting with
mentors on a regular basis. But of course,
you will be collaborating and cooperating with your classmates
in a two to three person team, and that idea in which you work together
and it's a team-based initiative, we think is another important
aspect of this course. Because in the real world,
it's rare that you work solely as an individual,
you have to find ways to work with others. And as a data scientist,
as I think you are well aware from the previous prerequisite courses,
particularly 501 and Becoming a Data Scientist, you will
inevitably need to work with others. And also besides, just for
example, crunching numbers, writing code producing notebooks,
producing expressive and effective visualizations, you will
also need to communicate your results. And if you can do that in
a collaborative environment, a team-based environment,
we think that will advance. You're not just simply your
knowledge as a data scientist but your ability to work with
others as a data scientist. And then we should probably note as well
that you've got a couple more of these experiences in your future
within the MADs program. So this Milestone 1 provides
you that ramp up opportunity to take what you have learned so
far in the course, and then begin to figure out how to work
with others within this context. >> Thanks, with that, I think we're
going to wrap up this intro video. Again, welcome to the course,
and that's it. >> That's it.
