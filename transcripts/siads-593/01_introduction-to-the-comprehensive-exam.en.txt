Hi. I just want to talk
to you a little bit about the comprehensive exam. The comprehensive exam component
of the course will take the form of an oral discussion with a member of
the teaching team. Now, during the
first week of class, we will share with you a list of questions provided to us
by the instructors of the pre-req courses
and we'll ask you to prepare responses to
each of those questions. The beginning of the oral exam, one question will be randomly selected and it's going to form the basis of a 20-minute
discussion with an examiner. The 20 minutes will be
divided roughly as one, there'll be a
five-minute presentation which you're responsible
for as the student and then we'll follow on with a 15-minute discussion
that plays off of your presentation
where we're going to dive deeply into the topic. The exchange will be assessed by another faculty member who
we term the adjudicator, nice fancy term, using a rubric that we've shared with you before the exam. The discussion will be
conducted using Zoom and will occur in Weeks
4 and 5 of the course. What's this all about? The purpose of the exam is to provide an
opportunity for you to speak about what you've
learned in the program so far and engage with
a data scientist, one of us, in meaningful conversation
about some of the ideas, tools, and techniques to
which you've been exposed. As long as you start
preparing early, you'll have ample time to
prepare your responses. The discussion we should take
the form of a conversation. We want you to have
fun and take advantage of the opportunity to
show off what you know. Not to ease any
fears that you might have regarding this experience. I assume that many of
you probably have not taken or sat for an oral
examination before. We've prepared a
video that weaves together some excerpts
from students who have completed the
comprehensive exam in a previous iteration
of this course. We'd like you to check it
out and then, of course, feel free to ask
questions about it in Slack or during office hours. Now, to prepare for your exam, we want you to reflect on what
each pre-requisite course has to offer toward a complete answer to
each of the questions. In particular, we want you
to reflect on how you have changed your perspective as a data scientist or toward
data science in general. We also want you to think
about the ethical concerns and issues that are raised by each question or by
specific scenarios. Above all, don't worry, you've got this, go blue.
