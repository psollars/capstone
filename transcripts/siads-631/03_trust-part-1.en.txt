The last topic we'll touch this week
is using experiments as a measurement, and we use an example,
which is the trust game. So we'll go through a classic study,
which measures trust in the lab, and this has been replicated
in many different labs. And then we're going into
an example where the researcher measures trust in the field. So this is an example of lab-in-the-field,
and then use the measurement to predict
people's real economic behavior. So this is potentially
a very important and promising aspect of experimental methods. We all agree that trust plays an important
role in economic and social transactions. For instance,
Professor Resnick has studied the effect of trust on online
transactions, such as eBay. When you make a loan,
when a financial institution makes a loan, it has to have reasonable trust that
the client will repay the loan. Trust is a lubricant that is underlying
many of the economic activities. Despite its importance, people for a long time could not agree on
how to define or measure trust. So the other interesting aspect
about trust is it is not clear what is the causal relationship
between economic outcomes and trust. Do people trust each other more,
therefore they have more transactions with each other, therefore you
observe more economic growth? Or do we have better institutions that
encourages both economic growth and trust in society? So for a long time people could
not decide what is the causal relationship involving trust. So we're going to look at one classic
example, which measures trust in the lab, and look at how it might be used
to predict economic behavior. So how do we measure trust? Lots of times the survey methodologies
usually say, you can just ask people. So for example, a very well known
example is the World Value Survey, which asked this question, generally
speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you cannot be
too careful in dealing with people? So the question is how
reliable are survey answers. It would be nice to have experimental
tools that allows measurements of trusting and trustworthy behavior,
which are incentivized. And that leads to the Berg, Dickhaut and McCabe paper on trust,
reciprocity and social history. I'm going to go through
the main results of this paper, it's primarily on the design. So the question really is whether
trust is a primitive behavior that can emerge in the absence
of repeated interactions, reputations, contracts and
potential punishment threats. To measure those, to answer this question, they came up with an experiment
design where subjects are anonymous, and they engage in a trust game, which
happens only once, it's a one-shot game. At this point you should go to MoLab,
login, you play the trust game. After you finish, you can come back and
listen to the rest of the lecture.
