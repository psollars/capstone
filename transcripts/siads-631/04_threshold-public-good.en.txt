Hi everyone. I hope you all enjoy playing the
threshold public goods. So let me first give you an overview of what
this game is about. So in each round, each group member receives
some amount of money. That's your initial endowment. Each player simultaneously
chooses how much to contribute
to a public good. Again, we call this the
water purification project. What differentiates
this experiment from the previous one is that
the project will only proceed if the
total contributions meet a threshold or
the project's cost. Otherwise, everyone
gets a refund. So this is primarily motivated by some of these
discrete public goods. For instance, we want
to build a bridge, and the bridge will cost
three million dollars. In the end, we
raised two million. Well, we can't really built
two-thirds of a bridge. So when that happens, we'll just refund everyone. It turns out that this refund
feature takes away some of the risks from
voluntary contribution and it changes the incentives. So what is your individual
benefit from this project? Is the total project cost, which is the threshold, times the rate of return. So here are the game parameters. We map you into groups of five. So you're playing with
four other players, and again, these will be robots. The threshold is set to be $50 and the rate of
return is 30 percent. So each round you receive $20 and you have to
decide how much to contribute and how much to keep for your own
private account. That will be your strategy. So what is your payoff? It depends on whether your group reaches
the threshold or not. So it really depends on
the total contributions. If you meet the target, you meet the threshold, the project will go on and everyone will derive the
benefit from the project. But the excess
amount will be lost. In the other scenario, if they're not enough
to meet the threshold, so in other words, the contributions
are insufficient, then everyone gets a refund. You're back to the $20 of tokens. So here's an example. So you start with $20, the project cost 50 with a
30 percent rate of return. You contribute 12 and
your group in total, meet the threshold exactly. So the total contribution is 50. So the project will go on. What is your payoff? So your payoff is going to be
your $20 minus the $12 you contributed to the group and your return from this
public project being built. It could be the bridge, so that's 0.3, which is the
rate of return times the $50. So in total, that's $23. So let's take a look and see what happened in the experiment. So again, this is from
your previous cohort. Everyone was in a threshold
public goods game, and each player is endowed
with $20 or 20 ECU. It's a group of five. So you'll match with
four other bots. The bot strategy is the
fair share to reach the threshold plus
a random number between minus three and three. So this is meant
to add some noise. So what will be the fair share? That's the threshold, which is the target divided
by the group size. So if the project costs 50, the fair share would
be 50 divided by five, so everybody should pay 10. If you look at what happened
during the experiment, in the first round, the average is actually 10. So that's the green line. In rounds two to five, the average is actually a
little bit higher than 10. This is because the
robot's strategy contains a noise of
plus minus three, so people learn to contribute a little more
to provide a buffer. This extra contribution actually is inefficient in this case, because if you exceed the
threshold, it will be lost. So compared to the linear
public goods experiment, you will see that the
range of contributions, the inter-quartile
range, is quite small. So which means that
most people are actually contributing
close to their fair share, plus a little buffer. So let's take a look and see what we have learned
from this experiment. So in this case, theory also makes fairly precise predictions, assuming that
everyone is selfish. So there's still a set of
inefficient Nash equilibria, which means everyone
contributes zero. But there's also a set of efficient Nash equilibria where everyone contributes
their fair share, so the sum of contributions exactly reaches the threshold. In the experiment data, we actually see that fair share seems to
be a focal point. So what have we
learned from the data? We see that theory makes fairly good predictions
on average. So most students contribute their fair share in round one. That's a good focal point. They also learn to
contribute a little more because of the noisy
robot strategy. So you don't want the
project to fall off because the robot happened to be drawing from
a negative shock. Now that you might be wondering, why do we include
this experiment? This is to illustrate how a threshold can change
incentives to free ride. In a way, the refund
cause essentially removes the risk from being the
only contributor or from being contributing
a small amount that's not quite enough to build the public project
or the public good. It is also useful because
this basically builds a foundation for the field
experiment which is coming up. So in the field experiment on a online microfinance
website called kiva.org, we look at the
incentives to join teams and the contribution
behavior of Kiva lenders. It turns out that Kiva uses a threshold public good
motto to provide loans to low-income entrepreneurs
in developing countries. So the way the Kiva
model works is, an entrepreneur
might need $2,000, so that's posted on
the Kiva website. So in a one-month period, if the contributions from Kiva lenders do not
meet the threshold, everyone gets a refund and the entrepreneur
does not get funded. If it meets the threshold, then the entrepreneur gets
the loan and would go ahead and enlarge her current business or whatever she proposed to do. So this helps explain why so many Kiva projects
have been successful. Again, I'm going to analyze
the data during office hours. So either logging, dialing
to the office hours or download the video
afterwards. Thank you very much.
