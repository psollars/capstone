So next we're going to go through some basic concepts in
experimental design. We'll refer to these
terminologies, after this first week. We will go through focus
versus nuisance variables, direct control versus
indirect control, and within versus between subject design and we'll also talk about factorial design. So let's first go through focus versus nuisance variables. For an experimenter
the focus variable is what you are interested in. You are interested in studying the effects
of these variables. Often times this could be a status quo institution
versus a new mechanism. So for instance eBay used to have a classic reputation system. So if you are a
buyer or a seller on eBay after each transaction the buyer can rate the seller F3 levels positive,
neutral, or negative. Within the last 10 years they
introduced a new mechanism, which is called detailed
set of ratings. The reason they introduce
this by the way is because, if you look at the
empirical data, eBay ratings are too positive. That is everybody's giving everybody else positive ratings, and so the positive rating
I think is over 97 percent. So if everyone's
positive then there's no information content
in the rating system. So through a sequence
of lab experiments, researchers decided to introduce the details set of ratings. So what you see here is that in addition to rating the seller positive, neutral or negative, buyers get to leave more detailed information on whether the item is as described, how about the communication, shipping time, shipping
and handling charges. So these are anonymous and would be given to
the seller in aggregate. So this prevents what
we often observe in the classic system which is
retaliation and reciprocity, and this has provided
more information for the eBay platform in general. So in this case we have the classic feedback system which is the classic reputation system. That's our control where
the classic system plus the detail set of rating and these two are our
focus variables. What about nuisance variables? Let's use the same context. So you're testing
these two variables, the original reputation system
plus the new mechanism. If you're testing this in the lab and experiment
is too long, then the subjects get tired and they're not
interested anymore. So the subjects alertness
and interests in the task at hand is an example
of a nuisance variable. So these variables has little or no direct
interests to the experimental but they
can affect the results. So you need to be very
careful in controlling both the focus variables
and the nuisance variables. So the experimenter
has direct control in the design process by choosing the constants
and treatments. Constants are variables
that you hold at a convenient level
and that's constant throughout different
experimental conditions. Whereas treatments or experimental conditions
are variables which are set at two or more different levels which might produce sharply
different outcomes. So one principle, a really important principle in
experimental design is that you want to vary
all treatment variables independently to obtain the cleanest possible
evidence on their effects. Factorial design which
is coming up soon is one of the methods
for doing that. So experimental can also have indirect control
through randomization. So randomization enables
the experimenter to assign participants or subjects into
different treatments. For instance experimenter
can also randomize roles within an experimental
session if that applies. In this case uncontrolled
nuisances can cause inferential errors if confounded
with focus variables. So suppose you are primarily interested in the
effects of new seeds. This is an agricultural
experiment, but good weather is a confound that could
help improve the harvest. In this case randomizing the plots of land into
getting new seeds versus the status quo seeds would enable you to look at the
effects of new seeds, given that weather
condition if I call all these different treatments. The next pair of concepts are between-subject versus
within-subject design. So let me go through
each of them. So between-subjects
design means that each subject only experience
one experimental condition. So in other words when you set your focus variable
to different levels, each subject only experience
one level or one treatment, and this is a very clean design. When you randomize subjects into these different conditions, you should always use it when you want to
control for learning. Within-subject design is when each subject participates
in multiple treatments. You should use it when individual idiosyncrasies
are important, but you have to remember that the order needs
to be controlled. So if a subject participates
in treatment A, followed by treatment B, then you should have conditions
where subjects first participate in treatment
B and then treatment A. You can also have more complex
crossover designs such as the ABA block versus the
BAB block and so on. So when we control for
order effects there is a very efficient
experiment design called the Latin square. This is when two or
more treatments are contrasted on the same
experimental unit. So for instance if you want
to test four tire brands, let's call them A, B, C, D using four different test cars. The order of the tire
brands distributed over cars using a Latin square looks like the
figure on the slide. So in car one you have
the order of A B C D. So let's say the first
two are front left, front right and the last two
are back left, back right. In car two, C D A B, car three D C B A and car four
B A D C. So if you look at the same position which
is the front left you have all four different tire
brands in this condition, and same is true for each
of the four conditions. So this gives you
an efficient design to control for the order effects. One of the most commonly
used experimental design is called a factorial design. This is when you have two or more treatment
variables and you want to set each of these treatment variables
at different levels. So for instance we use
a real field experiment conducted where you manipulate the messages on team forms. So one dimension is to set a goal for the team
versus no goal. The other dimension
is to give a link a URL to the borrowers
versus no URL provided. This is to vary the presence or absence
of transaction costs. So what would a factorial
design look like? So this is a two by
two factorial design. So one factor is
the goal dimension. Here we vary the
no goal and goal, so these are two levels
for this factor. The other dimension is
the link dimension. So you either provide no link in your message or
a link in your message, and this also enables us to study the interaction between
these two factors. So when you don't
provide any link, so I'm looking at
the first column, the no link column. Comparing goal and
no goal would let the experiment to isolate the effects of goal
setting without links. Whereas if you look
at the last column, the experimenter can
compare the no goal versus goal setting with links, which means when you have
a reduced transaction cost what's the effect of
goal setting on lending. So that's an example of a
two by two factorial design.
