Hi everyone. I'm Yan Chen, I'm a professor at the
School of Information at the University of Michigan. So I'm here to discuss
experiment design and analysis, and so we'll go through this
course in about four weeks. So the first lecture is an
introduction to experiments. We'll go through
the basic concepts, and we'll first talk about
what our experiments are, why we want to conduct the experimental research given the abundance of
naturally occurring data. We'll also talk about
experiment design, some of the brief
the basic concepts in experiment design. Then we'll go through two papers, one is the foundation
for lab experiments. We'll talk about
induce value theory by Vernon Smith in 1982. The other one is an analysis and a framework for field experiments by
Harrison and list. Then the last topic is online field experiments or
sometimes in tech industries, it's called A/B testing. We will go through a paper
by Chen and Konstan. So let's first go through
the definition of experiments and why we want to conduct
experimental research. So there are many different
definitions of experiments, but the most important feature of an experiment compared
to let's say naturally occurring field data is
that the experimenter has a lot of control when she
designs or runs an experiment, and it is a consensus
among experimentalists and empirical researcher
that there are no other empirical method which allows a similar tight
control as do experiments. One of the features in
experimental design and implementation is the
procedure of randomization. So we will go through various
methods for randomization. An important feature about
randomization is that, selection bias can be
entirely removed when individuals or groups
of individuals are randomly assigned to the
treatment or the control group. So let me first elaborate
on the control part. How is it that experimenter get to have better control over
the data that's generated? This is through varying
certain variables in an exogenous fashion while keeping everything
else constant. So as an experimental
you know whether variables are exogenous
or endogenous. You can isolate the possible
causal relationships. So let me first define, here's a little footnote on, what is considered exogenous
versus endogenous. An exogenous variation
is a variation that the study participants
cannot control. So for instance, this year
there's a lot of rainfall, and that's something that we as decision-makers
cannot control. In comparison an
endogenous variable is something that the
decision-maker can control. So I can decide whether
to join the team or not, or I can decide whether I
want to be an Umber driver, or how much I want to
drive if I joined Uber, and those are called
endogenous variables. So in an experiment
an experimenter can first know which variables are endogenous versus exogenous. Second, through careful
experimental design I summate the possible
causal relationships. A second part about
better control is that the experimenter controls
the information decision, and so the experimenter can decide how much information to release to the participants, and this is also important
for replication. The third part about control is that participants are randomly
assigned to conditions. So whether you are in the treatment group or
the control group is not controlled by you but by a randomizing device controlled
by the experimenter. So through randomization,
we can eliminate the selection bias and
we're going to discuss more about the selection
bias using examples. As a result when you get experimental data if it
is carefully designed, you would need
simpler econometrics or Data Analysis methods. So more about better controls. So the experimenter can observe variables that are often not
observable in the field. So when you look at eBay data, you cannot observe the
maximum willingness to pay from the bidder, but in a lab experiment you can. More control also means
that the researcher can calculate the predicted
equilibrium exactly, and you can observe both equlibrium and
nonequilibrium behavior, you can also observe
equilibrium dynamics, how fast or slow people converge to the
equilibrium prediction. So later on we'll actually
use an example of first-price auctions to first theoretically
Compute the equilibrium, and then we're going to give you a dataset as part of your
homework assignment. So you can look at how people behave and whether it conforms to the
theoretical prediction. So the next topic
about why we use experimental methods is the idea of being able to isolate
causal relationships. So we say that A causes B rather than A just correlate with B, there has to be a number
of conditions which enables us to make
these conclusions. The first condition is that the two variables have to be
correlated so they co-vary, and the covariation between the two variables is not
spurious or they're not random. Thirdly, there's a
logical time orders, so A must precede B in time. Lastly, again we're going back to the role of theory that
theoretically we know that a mechanism is
available that explains how an independent variable
causes a dependent variable. So let me go through each
of these points.The first is extremely important which is correlation is not causation. We often observe two
variables co-vary and that let us conclude that
these are correlated. But correlation is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for causation. So for example, we observe
that countries with a high rate of infant diarrhea also have bad road conditions. But we know from common sense
and from data that that road conditions cannot possibly cause infant diarrhea
or vice versa. So these are correlated, but there's no
causal relationship between these two observations. The third part the third
aspect is spuriousness. So for A to cause B the covariation between
the two variables should not be spurious. So what would be a
spurious correlation? One example is that
ice-cream sales are highest in the city when the
rate of drowning in city swimming pools
is also highest. So in this case the high temperature is
the common variable, and ice-cream sales does not cause drowning or vice versa. The third aspect is that
there has to be a time order, a logical time order
between A and B. So if for A to cause B, A must precede B in time. So for example, I kicked
the table and hurt my toe. Then kicking the table
precedes hurting my toe, and this gives us a
plausible time order which says that
kicking the table is the cause for hurting my toe. So the last part is
the role of theory. So a good theory it could
be mathematical or not, it provides a mechanism which explains how an independent variable causes a
dependent variable. There are several
rules for theory even though this is about experiments, experiment design and analysis. So the role of theory is
that theory explains facts, theory can also make predictions. Oftentimes these predictions
are quite precise. The last part is theory
formalizes intuition. So implied in all of these is the idea of confounders
or lurking variables. So when we design an
experiment we want to make sure that there
are no confounders. So what is a confounder? A confounder is a variable
that influences both who is selected for the treatment and the outcome of
the experiment. Another more common definition is that a confounder
is a variable that influences both the
dependent variable and the independent variable
causing a spurious association. So here is an example. So the question is
does SAT preparation costs courses improve SAT scores? If you just look how
the correlation, the answer is positive. So in this case SAT
preparation courses is one factor is the independent
variable we call it X. SAT scores is the outcome
variable that we call Y. But if you think deeper about this relationship you
will realize that there are unobserved
factors which predict SAT scores that are also correlated with
taking a prep course. What are some of these? One example is family wealth. So these rich families are able to provide their kids
with SAT prep courses, they're able to pay
for the tuition. But they might also
provide other resources that would help
improve SAT scores. So in this case we
say family wealth which has Z variable is a confounder because it is positively correlated
with both X and Y. So experiments can be a solution to the problem
of unobserved confounders. In experiments, let
me first define some of the terminologies
that we often use. We say that there is usually a treatment group or at
least one treatment group, and at least one control group, and these terms come
from medicines. So when you're in a
control group you take a pill which has no
active ingredients, whereas if you in the
treatment group you take a pill that contains the active ingredient that medical doctors
might want to study. So in the generic experiment we also use the same terminology, the treatment group
versus the control group. So one thing that experiments can do is random assignment. So subjects are randomly assigned to treatment or
control conditions, that help generate statistically
equivalent samples. These can all be tested. We'll talk about examples
later on on how you might test whether the random
assignment gives you statistically
equivalent samples in the control and
the treatment group. So going back to the SAT example, if we use random assignment
if this can be done, then we will ensure that
subjects or students taking SAT prep courses
versus those who are not given SAT prep courses
are randomly assigned. Which means that if you look at the distribution
of family wealth, you will have the
same distribution in the control group and the treatment group which resolves the issue
of confounding.
