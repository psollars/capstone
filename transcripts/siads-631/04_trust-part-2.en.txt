So you've all played the
Trust Game on [inaudible] , and so I'm going
to just summarize the Trust Game that
you've all experienced, and we're going to
summarize the paper. So there are two players each with a initial
endowment of 10 points. player 1 can transfer
t points to player 2. The transferred
points are tripled by the experimenter before
it reaches player 2. Player 2 then is informed
how many points he receives, and he can return any amount
r. So the payoff structure for player 1 is denoted by Pi_1. So player 1's payoff is 10 which is the number points
he start off with minus t which is the transfer passed to player 2 plus
r, the amount returned. Player 2's payoff
is going to be 10, which is the initial endowment plus 3 times t.
Remember the transfers, any point transferred to
player 2 is tripled by the experimenter and then minus the points that she
returns to player 1, which is r. If you use Game Theory and
backward induction, you would anticipate that
the standard prediction is player 1 if they are self-interested and they do not care about the
other player at all, should transfer
nothing and player 2 should return nothing
that would maximize. So player 2 would for
whatever amount she receives if she returns nothing which is r equal to 0
will maximize her payoff, whereas player 1 anticipating this should not
transfer anything. So there are several hypotheses. What I'm stating here is the alternative
hypothesis because we know the null hypothesis
from game theory backward induction with
self-interested players. So the first
alternative hypotheses is r is greater than zero, which means that players
are trustworthy. When they receive something
they want to reciprocate, they could also be inequality
aversion that they would like both players to be better off or it
could be mistakes. The second prediction is the transfer or what measures
trust should be positive which means that the
first player might care about the second
player and there might be some altruism evolved
or efficiency concerns which is it is efficient to transfer because every point
you transfer is tripled by the experimenter before
it reaches the recipient. The Trust Game by
design though cannot differentiate between these
alternative hypotheses. So for instance, if you observe someone returns a certain amount you cannot say for
sure whether it is reciprocity or
is it by mistake. Alternatively, when you observe someone pass a positive amount, you cannot differentiate
the motive. It could be altruism or it could be beliefs
in efficiency, all believing that the other
player will reciprocate, and it could also be because this person is
wanting to take some risks. The procedure for them to conduct the original trust experiment is they recruited
undergraduate students from the University
of Minnesota who have participated in at least one previously
unrelated experiment. So the subjects are
somewhat experienced with computerize
experiments in the lab. When the subjects arrived, they were assigned to
either room A or room B. The paper actually doesn't say whether they're
randomly assigned. So a good experiment
should randomly assign students to
remain in room B. Everyone is given $10. This rules out inequality
aversion as a reason of giving. So I won't give because I have $10 and the other
guy has nothing. Everyone has $10 and each room randomly select a monitor who draw chips
without replacement. So this actually increases the trust among the subjects about the experimental procedure. So the experiment
has two treatments. One is no history, the other treatment is
with social history. The experiment importantly
is double-blind, which means that the subjects do not know each
other's decisions. The experimenter does not know any of the
subject's decisions. So this potentially avoided the reputation building
incentive or collusion, potential punishment
outside the lab, or the experimental
demand effect which means that I want to appear good. I want to appear like a decent person in front
of the experimenter. So what is a
double-blind experiment? So it is an experiment in
which the subjects and experimenters do not know which treatments are
being assigned to whom, and they do not know
the decisions either. Eventually, at the end
of the experiment, after all decisions
are anonymized, the experimenter would
receive the data. So this is the results for the no social
history treatment. What you see here is the amount
sent is the empty circle. The payback is the solid circle. What you see is the distribution amount
sorted by amount sent. So in the first bar on
the left for example, the person sent all
$10 which got tripled. It becomes 30 before it
reaches the second player. The second player then
has a total of $40. Ten dollar initial
endowment plus the $30. Then she returned
$20 to the sender. So in the end, each player gets $20. If you look at the rightmost dot, so this is sorted by
the amount sent and the amount returned in some
way by the amount sent. So you have a number of
observations who sent all $10. If you look at the empty circles, some sent 15, 7, 5, there are a number
of people who sent five, fewer than five, and there are also people, two observations who sent zero, and of course nothing
was returned. So this is your game theoretic, game theorists subjects who did backward induction
and they're selfish. So you see a spectrum but the conclusion is we can reject the subgame perfect
Nash equilibrium prediction, which is to send nothing
and to return nothing. So this is a good measure
of trust and reciprocity as primitive behavior because
it's conducted under the double-blind condition
and it is a one-shot game. So there's no way to
establish a reputation, and the strength of the study is really in the
experimental design. So in the paper, you
actually can see the instructions
printed out in full. That's what the experiment
is set to the subjects. There's a bit of a
weakness in terms of the statistical
analysis but I'm now going to elaborate here. So the last people we're
going to discuss is an example of a lab in
the field experiment. So the title is Using
Experimental Economics to Measure Social Capital and
Predict Financial Decisions by Dean Karlan. So the motivation is
whether the behavior that we measured in the
lab actually can be used to measure
something real or policy relevance and the
instrument of that the experimental used
was the Trust Game that we just discussed and the innovation here
is that he measured people's trust and trustworthiness
using the Trust Game, and then a year later, he went back to the
same group and look at their financial decisions whether they defaulted on their loans, their savings and so on, and correlate the two. So the substantive
question is whether untrustworthy
individuals are more likely to default on their loans, whether trusting individuals are more willing to contribute to a loan guarantee fund or it was more like
a public debts. So the key innovation here is, can the trust game be used
to predict future behaviors? So in most of the empirical work before this paper people
look at survey responses, for instance, in the
general social survey, and use the response to
predict real behavior. So what [inaudible]
experiment does is that yes he uses the general
social survey response, but he also carried out
a Trust Game implemented a chess game among villagers who participate
in a microcredit program. So this microcredit program
is called FINCA in Peru. So FINCA is short for Foundation for International
Community Assistance. So this is a group lending and savings project and usually
there are 30 women per group, and no one gets a new loan until all prior loans are paid in full. So there are weekly loan
payments and savings deposit. Communal savings then are held as collateral for
each others loans. So here are some more
backgrounds about FINCA, and the data that
they experimenter collected include the Trust Game, the Public Goods Game, the General Social
Survey Questions and survey on a variety
of interactions. He also merged it with
the loans and savings administrative data
which is what he used to predict real-world
economic decisions. So social capital is
defined as the bonds and commonalities between
individuals in a social group. It can be either explicit
or emotional behavioral. So explicit social capital
can be organization membership share common
membership or you have can be measured
using attitude, looking at attitude
towards others and overall trusting and
trustworthiness. In lots of empirical work has been shown that social capital is a key element for
overcoming market failures such as enforcement of
a lending contract. So the general social
survey questions that's often used to measure different
traits are the following, so you can ask people,
Generally speaking, would you say that most
people can be trusted or that you can't be too
careful in dealing with people? So that measures trust. There's also a question that
measures fairness which is, do you think most people would
try to take advantage of you if they got a chance or
would they try to be fair? The last question is often
used to measure helpfulness. Would you say that most of
the time people tried to be helpful or that they're mostly just looking out for themselves? So what Karlan did is to recruit these villagers
who participate in the micro-credit program
to play the trust game. Sometimes the partners in a trust game are in the same groups,
sometimes they're not. But he elicit that information. He asks each individual
whether they know their partner and what
the partner's name is. So the way it's implemented is each player receives three coins. The assignment is
done public place so that each player knew who her partner was but done quickly so that there was no time to
communicate with a partner. So in contrast to the burg at all paper which
uses double-blind, this one is not double-blind. So you know there's
also anonymity, so you know exactly who
you are playing with. The players actions are
done privately with experimental or his
researcher system but away from the group. So this could cause
experimental demand effect. But again, he's
implemented instead of in a lab in the field so the
conditions are tougher. So what are the rules? So player A passes to
player B either zero, one, two or three coins. They experiment in
doubles whatever A passes to B and give it to B. Then player B decides how
many coins to pass back to A. Again, the amount
that player A passes to player B measures
his or her trust, whereas the amount
player B passes back to player A measures
her trustworthiness. Then the game ends. So here are the set of hypotheses from the trust game and
the general social survey. So for player B,
higher amount passes to player A indicates that
Player B is more trustworthy. That might imply that
she is more likely to repay her loan and she's
also a better group member. For player A, higher
amount passes to player B indicates
that she's more trusting. That she might put more
money at risk with peers which is their
savings account and that she might be
a better group member. For the general social
survey questions, if her response indicates
more positive attitudes, that might imply that she
is a better group member. So the empirical strategy in this experiment is to predict
behavior in the trust game and look at financial
decisions a year later which is whether the person
default on the loan, whether the person is kicked out due to default or discipline, or whether the person has
new voluntary savings. There are some data problems. One of them is that he observed some attrition from player Bs and these attritions
are not random. So this is a pretty big
messy regression table. It looks at whether behavior in the trust game predicts
individual financial outcomes. So to recap, Dean Karlan went to run the trust games in the field with members of the
micro-credit group, and a year later he went back and collected their
financial outcomes. So the first three
columns looks at whether the person defaults
or not on their loan. The second three columns, columns four to six
looks at whether the person dropped out due
to default or discipline. The last three columns,
columns seven, eight and nine looks at total voluntary
savings contributions. So if you look at panel A, panel A looks at
player A's decisions. So of those who were randomly
assigned to be player A, the proportion that they
passed in the trust game actually has no prediction or whether they default on loans. It has some predictive power on whether they're dropped out
due to default or discipline. So there's a positive
effect there. The more they passed, the less likely they are going to contribute to the
voluntary savings account. Now let's take a look at panel B. Okay. So these look at player Bs, and the independent variable
here is the proportion that player B returned to play A which should measure player
B's trustworthiness. So if you look at the first
three specifications, it says that a player B who
returns more to player A, in other words who's
more trustworthy are less likely to default
on their loans. The next three columns
basically says they're less likely to be kicked
out due to default. The last three columns
says that they're more likely to contribute to
voluntary savings account. If you look at the public goods behavior actually it doesn't
predict anything. The general social
survey questions, their answer relative
to the society at large has some
predictive power. So let's summarize
what we learned from this lab in the
field experiments. So what Karlan found
is that for player Bs, those who are more trustworthy
are more likely to repay their loans
and they're more likely to contribute
to savings account. In other words, trustworthiness predicts higher
repayment and savings. Looking at player A, more trusting player A actually predicts lower
repayment and savings. So there are subsequent papers which says that in
the trust game, player A's action doesn't
necessarily measure trusting, it could also measure the
willingness to take risks. So here's what we
conclude from this study, that this game seems to have some predictive power but not necessarily in the way that
the literature would predict. So we know that player B's amount returned or
proportion returned is a measure of
trustworthiness and that predicts real-life
economic decisions, whereas player A's decision
is a willingness to take gambles probably
together with trust. So this is a very good example of one of the first of lab
in the field where you use measurements tested in the lab to measure
traits or primitives in people in the field
and try to use that to predict people's real-life
economic decisions. So we're going to
conclude this week. Again, you will have some
experimental data to work with your homework
assignment and we'll also go through some of
the concepts. Thank you.
