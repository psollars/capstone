I hope everyone enjoyed playing
the MobLab experiments. So for week 1, you play to sealed bid
auction experiments. I'm going to go through each of the experiments has
a brief review, and then display the data and talk about why we
need the experiment. So in the experiment, each student is
paired with a robot, and so each auction
has two bidders. Your individual valuation
for the object is a random draw from a uniform distribution
between zero and 100 and in your
auction you submit a bid and your robot
partner also submits a bid. Let me briefly review
the robot strategies. So in the first-price
sealed-bid auction, we repeated it for five rounds, so everyone has a chance to learn what the strategy should be or what's a profit-maximizing
strategy for you. The robot always bid
half of its value, or b equals V over 2. So we derive that in
the prior module, which looks at what
is a expected value maximizing bidding strategy in a sealed-bid auction
with two bidders. In the first-price sealed-bid
auction with two bidders, then it turns out to be m minus 1 over n times your value. In this case, n equals 2, so the robot bids
half of its value. In the second-price
sealed-bid auction, we again played five rounds. In this case, the robot follows what we call
a dominant strategy, which is always
bid is true value. In other words, the robot's
bid b equals its value v. What are the set of payoffs? Again, this should be a review. So the highest bidder at the end of an auction is
the winner of the auction, and the payoff for the winner is going to be the winner's value, which is your random draw
minus the price you pay. The price is truly what differentiates the first prize from the second price auction. So in a first-price auction, the price is simply
the highest bid. Whereas in the second
price auction, the price is the
second-highest bid. In either case, the payoff
for the loser is zero. So you don't get the object
and you don't have to pay. So let's take a look at the data. This data is actually
from the previous cohort. It's not from your
cohort and I'm going to review the data from your
cohort during the office hour. So in the previous cohort, the students face the
same incentives and face the same type of
robots as you did. So on the left graph, what you see is the bid. So in blue, that's the
human subjects bid. The humans bidders bids. The dot, the blue
dot is the mean and the error bar is plus minus
one standard deviation. So you'll see that it's noisy. So this is in the, what's called the
bid value space. So we look at everybody
who, let's say, happened to draw a value of
20 and see how much they bid and it turns out that a
lot of them bid around 10, but sometimes higher than 10. So what is the pink one? So the pink line is
the robot's bid or the equilibrium bid when
the player is risk neutral. In this case, it is
half of the value. So the robot would bid 20
if it draws a value of 40 it's going to bid 40 when
it draws a value of 80. So what we see is that
the human bidders are on average slightly higher. They bit slightly
higher than the robot. On the right graph, we see that this is the
first-price auction again and what you see here on the right
graph is the scatter plot, which is the individual bids. So the left side
is the aggregate, so it gives you a better
sense of the trend and the noise and on
the right-hand side, you can see that most of the dots are above the pink line, which is the risk-neutral
equilibrium bid. But it's quite spread out in the sense that we have players whose value was one and
was bidding 20 or 50, which is very high. Actually, if they won, they would have lost money. So overall, we see
that bid is slightly above the risk-neutral
equilibrium bid, which is actually consistent with most players
being risk averse. So this concludes our summary of the experimental data from MobLab for the
first-price auction. Now, we're going to take a look at the second-price auction. So in the second-price auction, the equilibrium bid is to bid your true value and that indeed
is what the robot adopts. So the robot always
bids its true value. That's what you see
on the pink line. So the pink line is
the equilibrium bid. So that should be the
45-degree line if it's on the same scale against
in the bit value space. If you look at the
human players bid on the left graph again, you see the mean plus minus 1 standard deviation
and it seems that most people are
actually the average is very close to the true value. For those with high
values it's actually a little bit below the true value. You see this a little more pronouncedly on the
right-hand side, where you see all the scatter
plots as individual bids, and you also see a
fair number of them above the 45-degree line
or above the pink line, which means these
people are overbidding. Again, as this
experiment has been conducted all over the world by many different researchers, we consistently find about
7-8 percent of the bidders overbid in second-price
auctions and over time, many of them learn to play
their dominant strategy. Of course, what you see here is every period put together. So overall, what we see
is that people learn to play their equilibrium strategy in the second-price auction. Whereas in first-price auction, it seems that people
are fairly consistently bidding above the risk-neutral
equilibrium prediction, which is consistent with
people being risk averse. So this is a box
and whisker plot, which looks at deviations
from equilibrium strategy. So what you see is in the
middle is the green line, and the green line is the
median human bidder's bid, whereas the blue box is
the inter-quartile range. So for the first-price auction, in fact, the green line
is exactly at zero, which means that the
median human bidder is bidding the equilibrium value. Same is true for the
second price auction, but there are a fair
number of deviations, both above and below
at the equilibrium. These are outliers in the sense that if you look at the
inter-quartile range, they are very close to zero, which means that there are some deviations from
equilibrium bids, but not a whole lot. So what have we learned
from this experiment? So in this lecture, we introduced the
induced value method, which experimenters use as
measurements in the lab. So this is a demonstration of how the induced value method
works in the lab. We also see that Game theory makes very
precise predictions. So for instance, in the
first-price sealed-bid auction, we know that if
you're risk neutral, you should bid exactly half of your value and in the
second price auction, if you recognize your
dominant strategy, regardless of what your
risk attitude should be, you would always bid
your true value. But if you look at the data, we show that most people are
actually not risk neutral, so they bid above more
than half of their value. That's consistent with
people being risk averse. In both auctions, the theory predicts
fairly well on average. So the meeting and the inter-quartile
range are very close, which means that
theory does a good job predicting the average behavior. But we also see a lot of
individual heterogeneities. So there are dots
all over the place, which means that people, at least in the early rounds, didn't really know what to do. Some players didn't
know what to do. But it takes time to learn how to best respond and how to converge to the
equilibrium strategy. So these are the
lessons we learned from the experiment
if you have time, I encourage you to come to office hours and I
will show you the data from the experiment that we conducted with the
your cohort. Thank you.
