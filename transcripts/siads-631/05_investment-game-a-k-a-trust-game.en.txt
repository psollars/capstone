Hello everyone. I hope
you enjoy playing the trust game and sometimes it's called
the investment game. I'm going to use these
terms interchangeably because the trust game is typically used to measure trust. In the burg at all paper that
we went through in class, the original researchers
call it the investment game. So you were in a
group of two players, everybody played the
role of the investor who is the first mover
and in a trust game, there's also a second
mover, the responder. So you each start with a
100 points or a 100 ECU. ECU is short for
Experimental Currency Unit. I'm going to just
shorten it as points. So this is the
experimental currency. The investor chooses
how much to send to the responder and that the amount send is
called the investment. The responder then gets the multiplier times
the investment. In the experiment, we
use a factor of three, so we triple the investment. The responder then chooses how much money to return
to the investors. So that is the rule of the game. So you would recognize that this is the familiar
interface from MobLab. So your endowment is a $100 and the responder
also gets a $100. So we have a very similar setup as the origin or trust game, where each player gets the same amount of
initial endowment. Then you decide how
much to invest. So the game parameters
is set such that, any amount you invest is
tripled by the experimenter, which captures the mutual gains from trade and from investment. So your strategy as the investor
is to choose how much to invest and the
responder's strategy is choosing how much
to return to you. So in the trust game, every student play the role of the investor and the
responder is actually a bot. So I also use these
set of games in my residential class at the
University of Michigan, and the responder is just
another student in the class. However, since people are playing asynchronously in
our online course, then we decided to pair
everyone with a bot. So there's a lot of flexibility on when you choose
to play this game. So the bots strategy
is to randomly return an amount from zero to
its maximum budget, which is three times the
amount you invested. That part is not in
the instructions. So MobLab is doing the process of developing
the instruction. So at some point it
will make it in. So because the bot
randomly chooses a number from zero to three
times the investment, the expected return is
half of that amount, which means is 1.5 times
the investment amount. So on average, exante, you actually should invest
everything and that's definitely the most
efficient outcome if it's not the
equilibrium outcome. What we see on the graph here is the actual amount invested by students from the
previous cohort. So what you see on the
horizontal axis is the number of rounds and on the vertical axes is the amount of investment. What you see here is the
box and whisker plots. So the green line
for each round is the median investment and the box gives you the
inter-quartile range. So what you see here is
that the green line moved from 40 in the first round
to 60 in the eighth round. That means people are on average increasing
their investment, but you'll also see
a very widespread, so the box is fairly large, which means there's a lot of heterogeneity in the
amount people invest. So in particular, you
will see that there are always people investing
zero, investing nothing. So they keep everything. It also hits 100, the maximum amount invested
starting from round two, which means that there are also people investing everything. So on average, people
learn to invest more but there's a lot of individual
heterogeneity in the data. So what have we learned
from this experiment? I hope everyone experienced the trust game as an investor. The only caveat is that the responder is actually a
bot and not a human player. So when you bring your
everyday experience in sequential transactions into
the lab or into MobLab, it might not always convey
what you intuitively expect and that's
unavoidable compromise made from these online courses. The other part is a
given game theory makes very precise predictions. So in this case, investors should invest 100
points in our experiment, meaning you invest everything and we see some people
going in that direction. So there's learning,
but learning occurs slowly from round
one to round eight. The median investment
increases from 40 to 60 and is not quite at 100. This is partly because
the instruction is not explicit about
the bot's strategy. The other part that we've
learned from this data set is, again, if you look at
inter-quartile range, it is quite large, which means that people have very different investment
strategies across individuals. It goes basically
from zero to 100, but the median is reasonable. So that's what we've seen in
other experiments as well. So I hope you will come to office hours and
during the officer will show you the data from this cohort of
students. Thank you.
