Now that you have participated in the auction
experiments in the lab, I'm going to introduce
auctions and why we're so interested
in auctions. We also will demonstrate the role of theory in data analysis. You should watch this
segment before you do the homework assignment
for this week. So auctions goes back
into ancient times. It's an exchange mechanism
to bargaining for selling a fixed supply of a
commodity for which there's no well established
ongoing market. So for instance, if you
want to buy a house, most likely you have to go
through a sealed-bid auction. The same applies to art,
flowers, oil leases. In the wave of privatization
and deregulation, lots of governments use auctions
to auction off airwaves. So for instance, the
FCC spectrum auction is a high stake example of this. The allocation of
common resources is often done through auctions. For e-commerce, for instance, when you search on Google, you're often shown some
of the sponsored ads. So these slots are auctioned off through
Adwords auctions, this counts for more than 90
percent of Google's revenue. So it is an important institution in our current
economic environment. So there are many different
forms of auctions. The most common form are what's called the
English auctions. So this is the
ascending bid auction that you see in a lot of movies as open-outcry
ascending bid. The Dutch auction
is descending bid. What you just
participated in MobLab is called the first price
sealed-bid auction. You also participated in the second price sealed-bid
auction which is sometimes called the Vickrey auction
in honor of the economist, William Vickrey, who formally
analyzed this auction. The Google Adwords auction is
called a position auction. There are many different
kinds and they all have very interesting properties. So let me go through the first-price
sealed-bid auction which you have participated
as a bidder. So this form of auctions
is often used to reward construction contracts
and real estate or allocate art treasures. In the MobLab environment, each bidder submits
his or her bid for the object to the auctioneer. So the object is an
abstract object. The auctioneer finds the highest bidder
who wins the auction. The highest bidder
gets the object being sold for a price equal
to her own bids. So the winner's
profit is going to be your value, your buyer value, how much is this worth to you, which we induce in the lab, minus the price you pay. In this case, the
price is your own bid. Everyone else's profit is zero. This is an example of an
induced value method because every bidder is given a value
for the abstract object. So you're in a group of two bidders competing
for one item, this is really the
simplest environment that we can come up with. The highest bidder gets
the object being sold. In the case of
first-price auctions, the winner's profit
is going to be the winner's value for the
object minus the highest bid. Everyone else's
profit, in this case, the loser's profit is zero. So I'm going to go through the mathematical solution
for this problem, and I'm going to solve
for a special case. This is officially a part of game theory and we
use it to demonstrate how theory can help with both design and analyze
experiment data. So let me first set
up the problem. In a sealed-bid, first price auction in the private
value environment, let's say we have n bidders, each bidder has a private value, we call v_i, which is his
or her private information. The distribution of v_i
is common knowledge, that means everyone knows the
distribution and everyone knows that everyone knows
the distribution and so on. Let's use B_i to denote
the bid for player i, and Pi_i to denote the
profit of player i. So here's the common
knowledge part, the rule of the game is common knowledge and
the value distribution. So v_i is joined uniformly
from the interval 0-100. What we're trying
to do is to solve for a Bayesian Nash equilibrium
bidding strategies. So as a theorist, now I'm trying to figure out to predict how bidders will bid. So let's go through the process. You must have gone
through the process when you act as a
bidder in MobLab. So how should you bid? You get a value, let's say eight points, if your bid is higher
than your value, then if you win, you will lose money because
you have to pay your bid. So therefore, you should
never bid above your value. We call that overbid. How about you bid exactly
equal to your value? In that case, if you win, you get zero profit, if you lose, you get zero profit, so it doesn't make a difference. So you don't want to bid
at your value either. What if you bid below your value? Well, there are two scenarios. One is, if your bid is
not the highest bid, then your profit is zero. But if your bid is
the highest bid, then your profit is going to be your value minus your bid, so there is a gap and
that's your profit margin. So this analysis
says that you really should bid below your value. The question is, how much below? Intuitively, the less you bid, the less likely you
will win the object. But if you win, you will earn more profit. So the optimal bidding
strategy is essentially a trade-off between
the probability of winning and the profit margin. So let's see how we resolve that. So I'm going to look at the simplest case
with two bidders. When there are only two bidders, you are characterized by the
strategy-type two tuple, which we'll call Bv, your bid and your value. Suppose the other
bidder's value is X and we don't know what X is, but we know that the other
bidder's also rational, so the other bidder will bid somewhere lower than her value. So let's say her bid is Alpha X, and Alpha is a number
between zero and one, then what's the expected profit? We use EPi for expected profit. So your expected profit is the probability that
your bid is higher. In this case, you
win the auction. So your profit is
going to be v minus B, your value minus your bid, plus the other scenario, which is, your bid is lower. In that case, your
profit is zero. So it's P, probability that your bid is
lower, times zero. So that term just drops out. We know that the
values are drawn from the uniform distribution
between zero and 100. So the probability that the other bidder's
value is lower than B over Alpha is going to be
B over Alpha divided by 100. So your expected profit
is just going to be one-hundredth of B over Alpha
times your profit margin, which is v minus B. But 1 over 100, as well as the parameter Alpha, are just constants, and we know that in the
optimization problem, we can just take them out. It doesn't affect the optimum. So we assume that
you're risk neutral. If you're risk
neutral, you should just choose your bid to maximize your expected profit. So you are maximizing
B times v minus B, your bid times your
value minus your bid. That's a quadratic function which gives you Bv minus B squared. If you've learned
the optimization, we know that we can figure out the optimal solution by taking the
first-order condition. So take the first-order, differentiate the
objective function Bv minus B squared
with respect to B. The first-order
condition is v minus 2B, we set it equal to zero. So the idea is, here's a quadratic function
and you achieve the maximum profit when you
are at the top of the hill. So that gives you
the optimal bid, which is B equals v over 2, which means that if you're risk neutral and there are only
two bidders in the auction, you should bid half
of your value. So you can figure out the optimal solution
by either using calculus or you can also use what you learned
in Algebra II, which is completing the square. So that will give you the
optimal solution as well. So we just derived that
when there are two bidders, the optimal bid for a risk neutral bidder is
to bid half of her value. What if there are more
than two bidders? It turns out that you can set up the problem exactly the same way and you will
get an optimal bid, an equilibrium bid as n minus
1 over n times your value. In other words, if n equals two, you'll bid half of your value. If n equals three, if there are three bidders, you should bid two-thirds
of your value. If n equals eight, you should bid seventh-eighth
of your value and so on. So as there are more bidders, people will shade less. So the bids will be closer
and closer to the value. The next question is, what if I am not maximizing
my expected payoff? What if I'm risk averse? There are different ways
of modeling risk aversion. But the generic answer
is, with two bidders, the optimal bid shoots somewhere in between your risk neutral bid, which is v over over 2 and v depending on the extent
of your risk aversion. Now we're going to switch gears to field experiments
and we're going to go through a paper by
Harrison and List. So this paper
essentially classifies the different kinds of experiments social
scientists conduct, and now we should
add computer and information scientists as well. So they put up the
different types of experiments on one spectrum, and we'll start with
conventional lab experiments. So these are experiments
very much like the auction experiment that
you participated in MATLAB. A lab experiment employs a standard subject pool,
usually they're students. There is abstract framing
and an imposed set of rules. These rules are what
the experiment are carefully designed and
imposed on the subjects. At the next level, what Harrison and List called artefactual field experiments are the same as conventional
lab experiments, but with a nonstandard
subject pool. Now people don't use this term, they call it lab in the field. So you might be going
to villages and use auctions to look at how well they can bid or how much they
contribute to public goods. You can measure
the risk attitude. We will go through an
example of lab in the field. So it gets closer
to reality because now the decision-makers
are real decision-makers. The next level is called
framed field experiments. So which is the same
as lab in the field, but with the field
contexts in the commodity, the task, the information, and the state, and so on. So you might be working
with financial advisers. These are your subjects. But if you look at their decision-making and
that's the advice giving, the contexts would
not be abstract. It would be in the context of their profession which
is financial advising. The last one which is very common these days are called
natural field experiments. So these are the same as
a frame field experiment, but with the environment is the one that the subject
naturally undertake these tasks such that the subjects don't even know that they're
in an experiment. For instance, you
might want to study the effect of reputation
on selling price on eBay. You could set up shops
as an experimenter, you can accumulate reputation and set up a seller
with high reputation, and you can set up sellers with low reputational,
almost no reputation. You sell identical items and figure out that will
enable you to figure out how much is the economic
return to reputation. In that case, the bidders are eBay bidders and they would not know that they're
actually in an experiment. They thought they are
bidding naturally on eBay. So that's a natural
field experiment. Most of the field experiment
that we'll talk about in this course are natural
field experiments. Natural field experiments are different from
natural experiments. A natural experiment
is when there are exogenous variations
but the variation might not be that exogenous. So for instance, in
the 1960s and '70s, most of the musicians in major orchestras in the
United States are male. Some orchestras started
to use blind auditions. In a blind audition, the committee cannot see
the gender of the musician. So they're call by
numbers and they can only hear what the
musician produces. So then using these
natural variation which is different orchestras introduced blind auditions at
different times, the economists were able to
figure out that the use of a screen increases women being recruited in
major orchestras. However, there
could be confounds. For instance, maybe
orchestras who are more aware of gender bias are more likely to introduce
blind auditions. So there are lots of unobservable factors which might have confounded the outcome. In a similar context, the experimenter can
control the variation. So for instance, if you want
to study whether employers discriminate against
job applicants with African-American names, you could send out
identical resumes with either white sounding or African-American
sounding names. So this gives the experiment
a better control over the resume quality and
other characteristics. So this is actually an example from Bertrand and Manetho in a very well-know feud
experiment where they uncover labor market discrimination
against African-Americans. You might wonder how do field experiments compare
to lab experiments? What are the pros and cons? So the benefits of field
experiment include, you use real goods to instead of induced values and people make decisions very similar to those that they
would normally make. So it's a familiar scenario. The decisions are more
representative of their normal daily decisions. The cost of field experiments is that you can't
control as much. You cannot control the
demand and supply curves, you can't even observe as much. So in a lab walk auction, we can calculate the efficiency, whereas in the field experiment, is actually difficult to calculate the efficiency
because you don't know people's maximum willingness
to pay for an object. The last topic is online
field experiments. This is something that you
will probably use are a lot if you end up working or you are currently
working for an IT company. In the IT sector, it's often called A/B testing. So these are essentially field experiments
implemented online, and the intervention is usually delivered
through different modes. For instance, it could
be email messages. You control for the content
of the email message by varying the variable of
interests in your email. It could be text messages. The intervention could also be delivered by a modified
web interface. So when people land
on your website, they're randomized into
one interface versus another interface
and then you can look at their behavior
on your website. It could also be
implemented dynamically through a browser
extension or by bots. So we will go through some of these examples as we
continue this class, and if you're interested in
these various techniques, you can read a short paper
by Chen and Konstant. So this concludes our first
week's lecture where we introduced the basic
concepts and experiments, both lab and field experiments. You will get to work on a
homework problem set that goes through some of these
concepts and you'll get to play with an option dataset. In subsequent lectures,
we'll go through some of these topics in much more
depth. I hope you have fun.
