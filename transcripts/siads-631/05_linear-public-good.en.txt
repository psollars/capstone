Hi everyone. I hope you all enjoy playing
the linear public goods game. So let me give a brief
overview of the game. And then we're going to analyze
the game and look at the data. So in each round, each group member receives the same
amount of money, that's your endowment. And you can simultaneously choose how
much to contribute to a public good, and in the mob lab experiment, they
call it the water purification project. In the sense that, you know, that's
clean water which will benefit everyone. And each individuals
benefit from the project is the total group contributions
times the rate of return. So this is a screenshot
from your experiment. So in this experiment,
there are four people in each group, and the rate of return from
the group account is 0.5, and that's in the project details. So your strategy in
each round is to choose how much of your endowment to
keep in your private account, and how much to contribute to the group
project or the public good? You can also, there's a history page, so you can also view what
happened in previous rounds, how many tokens or
how many dollars other players invest? So what's your pay off? Your payoff depends on
your contributions and the contributions of
the other group members. So here's an example,
we'll go through a numerical example, and we'll do a little more of
a high-level analysis. You started with $20 in each round and the rate of return is 50%, or 0.5. Let's say that the group of
four contributed $20 in total, and you contributed $12. So what is your pay off? Your payoff is what you start with, which
is $20 minus your contribution of $12. So that's how much is left in
your individual private account. And your $12 go into the group account,
and the other people from your
group contributed $18. So altogether, there are thirty
dollars in that group account. And each of the thirty
dollars had a rate of return of 50% to you, which means that you derive $15 of benefit
from the group account. So your total payoff in this case is $23. Notice that is higher than what you
started with which is twenty dollars. So this game is meant to
represent the provision of public goods through
voluntary contributions. So there's a question of why
people donate to public goods. Lots of the public goods such as,
you know, Wikipedia, United Way were provided through private voluntary donations people donate time or
money to a good cause. People might be doing that for social rewards or punishment,
if they if they free-ride. And sometimes the incremental
increase of the public good is worth that much to them. They might do it out of altruism or,
you know, positive emotions such as fun or
interests. And so
what's relevant in this context is what economists call free-riding, which means
you choose not to donate to a public good, but still benefit from
the donation of others. For example,
you listen to the public radio and you don't contribute to the public radio,
that would be free-riding. There are similar terminologies
existing in other disciplines. So social psychologists
call it social loafing. And so
what we see in this example is that each participant had 20 tokens to start with,
and they can either keep it in their private account or
contribute some to the group account. The private account is converted
to cash at a constant rate, whereas the group account yields
lower return to the individual. So in our experiment its 0.5,
which means your private return from your donation is half of what
you put in, but each additional dollar contributed by others also give
you this additional return of 0.5. So in the numerical example that we did
before, other people contributed $18, and you derive nine dollars of benefit
from that donation as well. So let's do a simplified analysis, with only two people, and then we'll
increase it to more than two people. So with only two players, so it's let's
say player one contributes X1 tokens or X1 dollars to the group account, and
player two contribute X2 tokens. The rate of return from
the group account is 0.5. So what is your payoff? Let's say your player one, so your
payoff Pi1 is going to be 20 minus X1. So that's what remains in your
private account, plus 0.5 the rate of return times the total amount
in the group account, which is X1 + X2. So now we simplify this expression and
combine terms. That becomes 20- 0.5X1 + 0.5 X2, and you can do the same thing for
player 2 and it turns out that, for player two,
player two faces very similar incentives. Player two's payoff is going
to be 20- 0.5 X2 + 0.5 X1. So now we're going to focus on
player one's payoff, your payoff. After considering everything, both
the return from your private account and the return from your group account,
you will see that to maximize your own pay off, the best thing that you
can do is to contribute nothing. Which is to set X1 equals 0. Why is that? Because every dollar that you donate is
a subtraction of 0.5 from your payoff, but you would argue that, well, player two is
also putting money in the group account, and I derive benefits from
player two's contributions. That's true, but you have no control over
how much player twowould be contributing. So the more player two contributes
the more payoff you will have, and the more you contribute, you know,
it's a net subtraction from your payoff. So we say that, in this case,
no matter what player 2 does the dominant strategy is to contribute
nothing to the group account. So this is actually true for
both player one and player two, which means that X1 = X2 = 0. So that is the game theoretic prediction,
assuming that everyone's self-interested. Now what if you have more than
two players, let's say you have an arbitrary number of players, n players
and they all face similar incentives. It is straightforward to generalize
this into the n player case. So take player I as an example. So we call the payoff Pi i,
and that equals 20- 0.5Xi + 0.5 times the sum of
everybody else's contribution. So that's the big summation sign XJ,
J does not equal I, that just means the sum of
everyone else is contributions. So again, with the n player case, it is still a dominant strategy to
contribute nothing to the group account. So basically X i equal 0 for all i. But when n is greater than 0 the Pareto
optimal outcome, the efficient outcome is actually to contribute everything,
because individual i loses 0.5 times X i, but others gain 0.5nxi. So everyone else gained this amount. So the total welfare actually is greater
when everyone donates everything. So that is the trade-off
between the private incentive, which is predicted by your equilibrium
strategy, dominant strategy, and the social welfare maximizer. So this, if you have heard
of the prisoner's dilemma, this is just a generalized version
of the prisoner's dilemma. So let's take a look at the data. So this is the data from
the previous cohort of students in the actual experiment. Yes, you are endowed with $20. So 20 ECU for each round. You're in a group of four,
in other words n equals 4, but the three other
players are actually bots. So that gives people flexibility
to log into moblab and to play the game whenever
it's convenient for them. So what is the bot strategy? In the first round the bot randomly
draw an amount between 0 and 20 and donate that amount. So on average the robots
donate 10 per bot, but it's a random draw from
the uniform distribution. In subsequent rounds, the bots act as conditional cooperators
in the sense that they would contribute the average contribution of the other
three players from the previous round. In other words, if the others
cooperate in the previous round, I will cooperate as well. But if they defect I would defect. So it is a very common strategy
that we observe in these games. And if you look at the right-hand
side of the slide, this is a summary of the individual
contributions over the five rounds. This is this is all human data. So what you see here is the box and whisker plots and
the green bar is the mediancontribution. So what you see is in the first round,
it's 10 and it goes up a little bit
in the second round and move back to 10 in rounds 3 to 5. And what you see is that, you know,
overall the average contribution especially in the later
rounds is about 10, but there's again a fair
range of contributions. So there's some people
contributing all 20 tokens and there's some people who free-ride and
contribute zero. So what have we learned
from this experiment? Again we showed that theory
makes very precise predictions, assuming everyone is selfish. So if everyone only cares about their
own pay off, the dominant strategy or the, you know, the equilibrium
strategy is to contribute nothing. What have we learned from the data? We see that more students are contributing
nothing in the last three rounds, but some students contribute everything,
and most students are actually
conditional cooperators. Meaning they basically match
what everybody else contributes. So that's a fairly robust behavioral
pattern that we see in voluntary contribution to public goods experiments,
especially linear public goods. So you might be wondering why
we include this experiment. This is to illustrate
the incentives to free-ride on other's contributions when
a public good is present. However, people don't really behave as if, you know,
you don't get everyone contributing zero. So there are some people who
are conditional cooperators, some contribute a lot, but
you will always have some free-riders. And it basically lay out
a theoretical basis for the field experiment that's coming up in the next
module, which is online movie ratings. So we will present an experiment
on movie lens, and you'll be asked to do a homework
assignment using that movie lens data. It turns out that movie
ratings is a public good, in the sense that your ratings will
benefit other users on the site. And there's also an incentive
not to rate as much. So hopefully from this stylized
moblab experiment you get experience the incentives to contribute
when there is a public good present. So let me emphasize again that,
you know, for this section we analyzed the data
from the previous cohort, and I'm going to do the data analysis for
this cohort during office hours. So please come to office hours
if it works for your schedule. Otherwise, you know, please download
the recording of the office hours. Thank you.
