So in this class will introduce
both lab and field experiments. So you might be using both if you are a
user experience engineer or ux designer. You probably will be conducting
a lot of lab experiments. If you're a data scientists working
at one of the IT companies, you probably be doing a lot
of field experiments. So let's use both methods and
they are complementary. So the foundational paper for the method of conducting lab Is Smith 82,
and a survey and a general framework set up on field
experiments is by Harris analyst. So let's go through each of these papers. Vernon Smith is a Nobel Laureate
in economics in the year 2002, and he is one of the pioneers
in experimental economics. And so one of the most important
contributions that he made to the methodology to the field
is the Induced-Value Theory. And that really laid the foundation for
lab experiments. So what's it like to be
a participant in a lab experiment? You will experience that as part
of the exercise for this week. You will be participating in
some auction experiments. You don't necessarily have to be in a lab. But this experiment has all
the components of a lab experiment. So first of all,
the experimenter controls the environment. So the experiment to decides how
much endowment a subject gets. What's the monetary incentive, and what's the technology used to
deliver these different treatments. The second component is
the institutions and rules. So everyone has an action space
that's the different options that you can choose from. There's a sequence that
the action takes place and there are information conditions. So these are what you're told about
this game or this experiment. And the last part is the framing. We use natural language. This is the instructions,
what you're told about the environment the institutions the rules
the other participants. So you will experience all of
this in the auction experiment. So let me go through the Induced-Value
Theory which is developed to set up a controlled experiment. So the first component is why
we need Induced-Value Theory. Why is it important to have subject
perform like real world subjects? So in some experiments, for instance,
in some psychology experiments the experimenter use introduced
the experiment and say do your best. Everyone's paid a lump sum to
compensate for their time in the lab. Whereas the Induced-Value Theory
says essentially the subjects has to be rewarded
based on their performance. In other words, there is a proper
use of a reward medium which allows an experimenter to induce pre-specified
characteristics in experimental subjects. So this reward medium should
satisfy three conditions. One is monotonicity, which means that the subjects
prefer more reward medium to less. And so money would satisfy this. In most of the cases though participants
would prefer more money to less money. The second condition is salience. That is the reward depends
on the subjects actions. So if you're in a trading environment and
you lose money, your total reward should go down
as a result of you losing money. Whereas if you make good decisions,
your reward should also go up. In other words, you know, lump sum payment as we talked about before
would not satisfy the Salience condition. The third condition is Dominance, which is changing subjects utility come
predominantly from the reward medium. This actually dictates a certain
number of experimental rules. For instance,
it's important to maintain privacy. It's important that subjects decisions
are not publicized to other subjects. For instance suppose one subject
is made worse off because of another subjects decision,
and privacy is not kept. As a result, you know, there might be ramifications
after the experiment is over. So the Induced-Value Theory dictates that
there is a set of practical implications in design. So for instance,
we often pay our subjects in cash. How about grades? If you have student subjects,
why don't you pay them in grades? That's much cheaper than cash. The problem with grades is
if the class is curved and then subjects don't just care about their
own grade their the number of points. They also care about how they
compare to the rest of the subjects. Which condition does it violate if
we go back to the three conditions? It would violate Dominance
because the changes in subjects utility come from
not just the reward medium, but also the relative position of how
I perform compared to others. So you have to be very careful
when you pay subjects grades, grade points, that the amount a subject
earns in the experiment should depend on the subjects
actions in the experiment. It also means that the average
payment should be higher than the opportunity cost. That it would ensure you that the subjects
would actually want to come and participate in the experiment. As an experimenter to you want to create
the simplest possible environment. We already talked about the role of
privacy of subjects and actions and payoffs. And then ask part which is
sometimes difficult to do, is you should not deceive the subjects or
lie to them. And this is because lots of times
the theoretical prediction is based on the belief distribution. And if you deceive your subjects,
they don't believe you anymore. An example for lying is a recent experiment conducted
on Facebook by Kramer et al. So the researchers wanted to study
whether emotions are contagious through social networks. To do so, they assign subjects
to a positive emotion treatment versus a negative emotion treatment. How do they do that? They manipulate what kind of
messages are displayed to you. So if your friends posted a message,
which is very positive, but you are in the negative treatment,
then you won't be be shown these messages. Needless to say this is deception and
it should not be done. So we're going to use
some auction experiment. So we talked a lot about
Induced-Value Theory and how you implement it in the lab. We're going to demonstrate it by a lab experiment that's setup
using the Induced-Value Theory. And they're both auction experiments
their first price sealed bid auctions and second price sealed bid auctions. You can go to MobLab and
finish these two auction experiments. So to motivate you the points you earned
in this experiments actually count towards your grade, and
we're now grading on a curve. So it does satisfy, you know, our three
conditions for the proper reward medium. And you want to earn as many points
as possible in the experiment. Have fun.
