Now we have talked about the
definition of sequences, time-series, and data streams. You can see that there's
actually one thing in common in all these
three data representations. And that is all of them have orders. No matter you're talking about a category item or the value, or the complex data
objects and event. And no matter whether you record the actual
timestamp or not, these objects come in order. Because we have the order, a common data mining task we can apply to these
data representations is to make a prediction. In many cases, we're particularly interested in making a
prediction in the future. Basically, by making
a prediction, we're looking at
the observed data and we want to make an
inference or a guess, about something that
we have not observed. For example, that something
could be a data object. Which car is going to arrive
in 20 minutes on the highway? Or it could be just the
property of data objects. For instance, the
price of a stock. What will be the
stock price tomorrow? It could be an event. It could be any information
that is about the event. The definition of the
target or prediction could be quite broad. But it is trying to figure out, trying to guess something
that we have not observed. And of course we
make the prediction based on what we have observed. As we said that, we are probably more
interested about making predictions for the future instead of making
predictions for the past. When the target of
predictions in the future, making a prediction is
also known as forecasting. We know a lot of examples of time series-based
forecasting. We will cover a lot
in this course too. In this course, if
there's no ambiguity, we will use predictions and forecasting interchangeably
because many of the techniques that we
use to predict the future can also be used to predict
the past and vice versa. But if there is ambiguity, I will use the two
terms differently. You can see that
predictions and forecasting are very common data
mining functionalities used on sequence data, time-series data,
and data streams, and in particular because
they have orders. And also in particular that they could let us guess
about future events. Let's first look at how to make predictions in the sequence. Or what are the applications
of sequence predictions. I'm sure that you have seen this. On Google if you type
in the query, nowadays you don't have to
finish the whole query. If you type in the
word university and Google is trying
to recommend to you, or is trying to make a guess of what you
wanted to type in next. You can see that not every
query word is the item. And the sequence of words gives you something that is
called a sequence of words. Then you can make a prediction. Google is making a prediction of the future items in the sequence based on
the historical items. Based on what you have
already typed in. It's good to see that University of Michigan
is the top guess. It is actually an
accurate guess for me. This is another example that
is also the Google product. If you look at in Gmail, nowadays whenever you are typing in a partial sentence
in your Gmail, it's trying to help you complete the sentence
automatically. Of course, behind there, there is lots of machine learning. Lots of natural language
processing tricks. But essentially, what it is doing is to make
predictions. Based on what? Based on the sequence
words you're typing. In these two examples, we can see that we have observed
partially the sequence. These are the previous
items or words in order. The target of the prediction are the next items also in order. The system is trying to guess, what are the next
and the next word we will type into this sequence. This is the typical application
of sequence prediction. What about time series
predictions? The same thing, right? Given historical values,
timestamped values, we can make a guess
about future values. For example, in the plot
to the left of the screen, we can see that we
have a set of prices, and in this case Google
stock prices over time. Some of them we have observed and these are
the scattered dots. Based on the stock prices we
have observed in the past, you could actually
make references, you can make inferences, and you can use your time
series answers techniques, which we will learn
later in the course, to make a forecast. That is to guess, what the price would
be in the future. For instance, you can see
that in this plot where making predictions
into the year 2021. You can see the time
series is not covered by the actual scatter plots are our
predictions or forecasts. Another real-world
example and that we're very familiar with
weather forecasting. Based on whatever
we have observed. Not only is the
temperature of today, but also lots of sensor data. Then we model the climates,
we model the weather, then we're trying to
make a prediction of the temperatures of
the weather tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, basically into the future. In these examples,
what we observed are time-stamped values up
to now, up to present. The target or prediction are the same type of value
at a future time point. And the prediction target will be the same
type of properties. For example, if you have
access to Google stock prices, you're also making
a prediction of Google stock prices
in the future. This is normally how it's done. But the difference is that,â€¨
we're trying to make the history, to make a prediction, to make
a guess about the future. Predictions are also
common for data streams too. Take the Twitter
stream, for example. This is the research work that we have done in the past
quite a few years, to detect rumors as early as
possible in Twitter stream. The basic idea is to model rumors as the cluster of tweets. You can see that it is actually
a complex data object in tweet stream. Or is the
complex event that is a rumor. Based on detecting
the rumors that are circulating in
Twitter in history, we're trying to make
predictions of, in what scenario then, a new rumor is going to be widespread. And if there is, we want to catch it as
quickly as possible. You can see that,
in this example, what we observed are the
summary of historical events. Why? Because the entire
Twitters stream is just huge, that no one can actually handle all the tweets from
the very first day. At least not in academia. The target we're trying to
predict is not just one item, is not just one value. It is actually the complex event. That is the arrival
of the new rumor.
