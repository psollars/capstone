Hello everyone. This
is Qiaozhu Mei, I'm a Professor at the
School of Information, and you probably also know me as the first director
of the MADS program. I trust all of you have taken the course Data
Mining I with me. It is a great pleasure to be
your instructor again for the follow-up course
Data Mining II. And I can guarantee you this is
going to be an exciting course. If you still remember,
in Data Mining I, we introduced a typical data
mining process where you harvest your data from different types of real
world applications. You manipulate the
data and you store them into databases or
any other tools you like. Then you conducted some
exploratory data analysis. That gives you sometimes a large set of complex
real world data. ThatÂ´s where data mining starts. The first step of data
mining is to formalize your data into different types
of data representations; for example, itemsets or vectors. Then based on the formal
data representations, we can match a bunch of
data mining functions, and that will give you different types of
data mining outputs, which we call them knowledge. This knowledge we
extracted can be used as building blocks for
downstream data mining tasks; for instance, they can
be used as features or other building blocks of machine learning or
causal inference. That is why the process
of data mining is also known as
knowledge discovery. In particular, in Data Mining I, we first introduced how real world data can
be represented as data representations such as
itemsets, vectors, matrices -- actually a matrix
is the collection of vectors with the
same dimensionality, if you still remember --
and sequences, time series, metrics, data
streams, so and so forth. Then we're able to
define a number of data mining outputs
of functionalities, including patterns,
similarity and distances, classification, clustering,
predictions, and outliers. We particularly focused on two of these outputs, patterns
and similarities, because they are simple,
but they can be used as building blocks to build
complex data mining outputs, such as classification
and clustering. They can be used as features for downstream tasks such
as machine learning. In particular, in Data Mining I, we covered three of this data
representations: item sets, vectors and matrices,
and sequences. We didn't cover other
data representations. We focused on patterns
and similarities as two of the data mining
outputs in Data Mining I. We introduced the algorithms
for mining itemset data, for mining vector
and matrix data, for mining sequence data. If you still remember
the apriori algorithm or the Levenstein edit distance, those are the algorithms to
extract patterns and compute similarities from these three types of
data representations. In Data Mining II
we will continue our journey to talk about
data representations, to talk about Data
Mining functionalities. But instead of focusing on
itemsets, vector and matrices, we will continue to talk
about sequence data, but this time with more
in-depth knowledge. We will spend two weeks
on time series data; and this is because
that time series is just such a powerful
data representation, it is commonly used in many different real
world applications. I'm sure that you have
seen lots of time series. We will not talk about
networks because there's another mass course
on network analysis. Instead, we will focus
on data streams. In Data Mining II we will also cover three data mining
representations, sequences, time series
and data streams. You can see that these
three data representations have something in common
because they are all ordered; that gives us hint on data mining functionalities and these data representations. We will continue
to talk about how to extract patterns and similarities from time series
data and data stream data. But because of the nature of the three data
representations, this time, we will add another very commonly used data
mining functionality. That is making predictions. Also, we will talk
about how to extract outliers from this data. We will continue to talk about algorithms for
extracting patterns, similarities, and
making predictions. In this time, we'll
add another approach to data mining that is called modeling or statistical modeling. This is a brief summary of what we will cover
in Data Mining II.
