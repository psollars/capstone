Hello everyone, this
is Qiaozhu Mei. We're going to talk
about Time Series Data. In the past week, we
have talked about how to model sequence data to make
predictions for the future, in terms of future items
or future series items, like a future part
of the sequence. Starting today, we will spend
two weeks to talk about the different data representation known as time series data. I'm sure that you
have heard about time series before
and you may have seen many different types of time series data
in your real life. To understand what time
series representation is, let's think about the difference between time series and sequence. Remember that a sequence is defined as the ordered
list of categorical items. If we write down that
mathematically, the capital X, the data, can be represented
as the list of pairs. A pair of categorical items, x_1, x_2 to x_n, and zero position indices, 1, 2, 3 to n. In other words, in sequence data representation, only the order matters. We usually use sequence
representation to model data like DNA sequences. As you can see that, a problem in using sequence representation is
that the position indices, in different sequences,
are not naturally aligned. The first position,
the second position, and the third position,
in one sequence, may or may not be the first, the second, and the third
position, in another sequence. We often need to use sequence
similarity measures, such as nutrition and distance, to find the best alignments
between different sequences. Time series data is defined as a list of timestamped
values or measurements. Mathematically, we
can also represent the time series data
as the list of pairs. This time, it's not
a list of pairs of categorical items
and position indices. x_1, x_2 to x_n are numerical measures instead
of categorical items, and t_1, t_2 to t_n are timestamps instead
of position indices. In other words, the difference between time series
and a sequence is that we're measuring numerical values and we're recording
the actual timestamps, not just the orders
or the positions. Using this representation,
we can deal with a time series with
the single measurement. For instance, x_1, x_2 to x_n are the measurements of the single attribute, for
instance, temperature. It is the single attribute. We take the measurements of the temperature over time
at different timestamps, and that gives us a
single time series. One example in reality is
the price of a single stock. We could also use time series to model multiple measurements. As you can see that in this case, we no longer use just a
single attribute, x_1. Instead, we use x_1
vector and x_2, a vector, to x_n, a vector. A vector means that there are multiple dimensions
in x_1 to x_n. These dimensions of
the measurements could be the measurements of
multiple same attributes, such as temperature and pressure. It could also be the measurements of different items,
of different objects. But you can see that no matter what, these different
measurements, these different dimensions of numerical values are naturally
aligned by the timestamps. One real example is the number of active cases of COVID-19 cases. You can see that we
can actually align the time series of the active cases of
different countries, by what? By the timestamps. This is to say that
multiple time series are naturally aligned by the timestamps versus
multiple sequences may or may not be aligned, because the only
thing that matters in a sequence representation
is the order, not the actual timestamp. We can see even more examples of time series as the
data representation. For example, when we're
talking about sequences, we talk about the queries people type into a search engine. The search engine could
also use a time series to model or to represent
the search traffic data. What they usually do, is to measure the frequency
of the search term. Measure how many times that
people type in the term, University or the current University of Michigan and
they measure that over time. If you go to Google Trends, you can actually see
many time series that's corresponding to search
frequency over time. Another example is to measure the groundwater
storage over time. This case, we can see that we have naturally multi-dimensional
numerical values. Each dimension corresponds to the measurements in a
different location. In this case, we can obtain multi-dimensional
time series and they are naturally aligned
by timestamps. Another application of time
series is sports analytics. Actually you can find lots of time series data in
sports analytics. The athletes wear devices. These sensors can actually measure the different types of sickness and tracks
them over time. You can actually wear
multiple sensors when you are actually
doing the sports. The sensor sickness give us multiple time series and they are naturally
aligned by time. Another example, in healthcare, you can see that through
those health devices, we can collect data, such as the ECG data or others. They're also taking the
form of time series data. Of course, multiple
aligned times. Yet another example, soundtracks. We're making recordings. When recording this video, the computer is actually
collecting my sound, and that's also represented
as time series. In this case, they usually use frequencies to record
this time series data. We will talk about
that next week. Time series data
are not just used to record natural measures
of data attributes. They can also be used to
record more complicated, even data science results. You can see that in this example, we're also measuring some
numerical attributes over time, over different weeks. This numerical
attribute is not just like the count or
the temperature. It is actually a result of a
data mining analysis itself. In fact, this is
measuring how likely is that different students will drop and book class over time. This numerical value, we're plotting over time, is
actually correlation. If the user dropped one course, how likely they are going
to drop another course in a similar category or in
a different category. You can see that time
series data can be used to measure real attributes of data as well as complicated
data science results.
