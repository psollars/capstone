Hello everyone, welcome back. In the previous lectures we've talked
about how to extract patterns from time series data and how to compute
similarities between time series. From today, we'll be going into another
big family of topics related to time series expanses that is known
as time series forecasting. Let me remind us again and again that a
time series is essentially a list of time stamp values or
measurements taken at different times. But this time, instead of using X to
indicate the series, I'm using Y. And no particular reason,
it's just because that we like to use Y to indicate that those
are our targets of predictions. And in the rest of the slides, you should
recognize that Y is the time series, where y1, y2, and
yn are numerical measurements and t1, t2, and tn are the timestamps
that those measurements were taken. So predictions and forecasting. Similar to sequence data, we also care
about making predictions, especially about making predictions into the future when
we're dealing with time series data. The definition of making
prediction is easy. Given the timestamp t,
we want to find what should the value yt, associated with that time stamp, be? Or in other words,
if we take the measurement at t, what would the measurement be? And in many cases we're particularly
interested in making predictions when t is actually in the future right? And in this case finding
yt is known as forecasting. For example, let's look at this time series plot
of the stock market price, right? If you can see that,
all the way through 2020, we are observing lots of scattered points,
and those points indicate that we have already
observed the value of this stock price. But you can also see that at the end of
this plot, we're actually making guesses. We are making plots into the future, so those are data points into the year 2021,
which has not arrived. So that means we're trying to make
predictions of what the stock price will be next year, so
by doing that we are making forecasts. There are [INAUDIBLE] of applications
of time series forecasting. We have seen the application
in financial market. Another application is weather, and
no matter whether we're doing that way or not, we are making predictions about
what the temperature will be tomorrow. Trying to forecast the traffic load
at particular intersections or highways are particularly important for
urban planning. Time series forecasting is important for
business planning as well. Trying to predict the supply and
demand in the future. In [INAUDIBLE] we use a math
program in making forecasts. We want to predict the number
of enrollments right? Of course, we hope that enrollment is
going up quickly again, year after year. Time series forecasting has also found its
applications in healthcare and epidemics. A particular example recently is to
predict the active COVID-19 cases in the United States, or
in particular states. Of course, many people are interested
in making predictions about elections, and that can also be viewed as
an application of time series forecasting. So that's why we're so interested in making predictions
of the future time series. While we're spending lots of time talking
about making predictions into the future, I want you to know that making predictions
about the past can also be useful. We use predictions on timestamps that are
not into the future to fill the missing values. For instance, if there should
have been a measurement, but we didn't take the measurement, then we
can look at the entire time series and try to make a guess of what
the measurement should have been. And making predictions about the past also
helps us to understand correlation or even causation. We also commonly use that to
make counter factual analysis. By counterfactual analysis,
we mean asking questions. What if, right? What if we had done x, y, z,
what would the outcome be? So in these cases we're actually making
inferences about the past, right? Instead of into the future. So, in summary, making predictions
about the past helps us to know how to make predictions about the future. That's why we're interested in both
making predictions of a time stamp that is in the past or in the future. So how to make predictions? Let's first look at making
predictions into the past. Because that severely easier. And why is that? Because we would usually
know two timestamps, one before and
one after the timestamp of interest. And let's see we know two data objects ET. Assume that the timestamp T time steps and
TJ. And to make the prediction into the past, we wanted to know why T
where T force between T&TJ. So how to make the prediction? Well, it is quite easy, right? All we need to do is to make
an inference based on the values nearby. In this case YNYJ. So if we plot YINYJ on this,
you know coordinate system. We can see that we can
always draw a linear line. That you know con XY in logic. And then given anytime T in between TINTJ. We can just find the projection
of tea on the same night. Right, and that gives us the value. Why in that is our predictive value. If we were believing that time series
is linear in between Yi and YJ. And we can use it right down
the mathematic equation, by the way, in this lecture you will
see many equations right? If you have trouble
understanding them on the fly, I encourage you to read through them. And to do the mass you know offline or
just come to the office. So you can see that to find
the predicted value YT given timestamp T, we can just compute. The interpolation of YINYJ. Basically, to find the projection of the
time T on the same night that connects. Why and why Jay so? This simple strategy is
called interpolation. Net works really well for
predicting values into the past. And that's because that we would always
observe one timestamp before and one time stamp. After you know the timestamp of interest. So for this reason. Interpolation is commonly used
to re sample a time series. What do you mean by by
recently a time series? As we know that when the time stamp is
connected right, it could be at weeks. It could be at days it
could be at minutes, right? But when we're analyzing the whole
sequence the whole time series, we may be interested in looking
at yearly patterns, right? Or looking at? BI weekly patterns sensor force. So in many cases what we needed to do. Is to re sample the time series to find
the measurements that should have been taken. For instance twice a week, but we haven't. And in this case we need to use
interpolation to guess want to measurements would have been. We can also transform the irregular time
series into the equally spaced work and that is also quite simple. Worth discussing, imma we said that you
know many times there's you know taken. Where the time stamps are not evenly
distributed and you want to realize them. We need to make this is of the missing
values and we can use interpolation. And this is the particular
example of interpolation, right? Suppose in the airline passenger data that
we forgot to take the measurements in three years. You know the most straightforward
thing that we can do. There is actually to just
use linear interpolation to make guesses about values
that we have not taken. So this is about making
predictions in the past. Then what about making
predictions in the future? You know related to interpolation? This also Australia called extra pulation. Right, that's basically making
predictions based on timestamps. Now in the past, and
then you know, trying to guess for the value mass into the future. Right, for example,
sometimes we know these values. These are basically you
know the past you know. Data points in time series an. Let's also assume that T is
there older timestamp then TJ. Then basically what we want to know
is the measurement taken at Time T. By this time T is actually
newer timestamp then both I&J. Well of course the same strategy
could work here, right? By actually connecting, why I and
YJ through linear line, right? Because that were interested in T that
is actually out of the range of T&TJ. So what we need to do is to extend. This night this dinner night and then to find projection right of
the timestamp T on this linear line. And in this case we can also
make a case about Yt right? And if you look at
the mathematic equation, it is actually completely
the same with interpolation. So life is good, right? Why don't we just use this? Why don't we just use this
simple strategy to make cases, to make forecasts into the future? Well, the problem is the following, right? Say if you look at this example that
we are extending this near line to get Yt given timestamp T. And then the two most recent
timestamps becomes Yj and Y. And then in this case, we're always only considering
two existing data points, right? Either Ty and Tj or Tj and T. Once we make the first guess. We make the first prediction. So it's of course. And we're also assuming that local
trend generalizes to the future, right? What do we mean? What we mean by local trend with
the local trend is essentially indicating 5 linear night between Yi and
Yj. But if you observe this local trend, it's fair to assume that anything in
between this range follows in trend. It's not fair to assume that this local
trend can extend into the future. And you don't actually know whether T
is actually far away in the future or actually very close by in the future. And if you continue to use this strategy
that we actually to inflation and why? Because if you care about making
even more predictions right, you will be predicting more and
more time points onto this linear line. And because it's near
line has the up trend, then the time stamp values in your
forecasts will be just larger and larger. Also, this simple strategy gives you the
point estimation, the point prediction, of the future value and
does not really explain the variance. Right, because we just assume that
the same local trend will follow. So normally we don't really
do this in practice. We don't really use this simple
extrapolation in practice when we're making forecasting. So you can see that if we're not careful, we could be making new
predictions one by one. And all the new predictions will be placed
on the same local trend by right and the predicted values. Y prime will be larger and larger. That leads to inflation, right? And in the end the only information
we considered when we're making these predictions is still just the very
reason two time points Ti and Tj. So what can we do beyond
simple extrapolation? If you're not going to use that for
time series prediction to the future? Well, we assume that suppose we have
found a better prediction method. It should consider the statistical
properties and the patterns of the whole theories instead of just considering
the most recent two time points. Right, for example, the message should
consider the mean of the time series and how the mean of the time series
change over time, right? So basically we're talking
about what trends. As I said that but simple extrapolation
measured does not explain variance. So that means we do care about
explaining the variance of the timestamp measurements we altered. In other words, the standard deviation
right of the Y1 to Yn should be explained. And we also care about the covariance. Covariance basically can be interpreted
as the relation between one timestamp and another time stamp. That is, let's say two measurements
away or a lack of three away. So the covariance between the lag
time stamps indicates whether one reading in the time series
depends on the previous readings. Right, and we all know that
in reality it you really do. We also care about
expanding the trend right? As we discussed that when we're
extracting trends from time series, there are linear trends, right? They're linear trends right? And we usually need to
fit them using what? Using regressions or
using moving average so and so forth. Also, we do want to explain patterns
such as seasonality, right? This is another example
from time series patterns. To summarize, we assume that
suppose we have found a reasonable a desirable prediction method to
make predictions into the future. It should at least help us explain
the statistical properties right? Such as mean variance, covariance,
trend, seasonality, any sense of course. And because these properties. Maybe for
overtime an over different time series, then we expect that the simple
explanation is not able to expand.
