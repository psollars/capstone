As I said, that interesting readers. If you look at this table, if you look at
how we actually fill this table to our right, to the one on the lower
right corner, right? And also the traces. That should actually remind you something
that we have introduced before, right? And in fact,
your sequence data mining, right? There is another table that we filled
that is computing the nearest and edit distance. Now I'm giving you the answer, right? And you can see that these two
algorithms are very much alike, right? They have lots of things in common. In fact, both of them have three
choices to make filling every cell. Basically, you're looking
at three neighbor cells. You assume that the three neighbor fields
of three neighbor cells are already filled before you fill the current cell. And in fact,
this can be verified using the equations. Dynamic time warming, right, basically
computes the unit distance XI and YJ. And add that up to
the minimum of the three dynamic time warping
distances of subsequences. And to compute ED distance,
we don't have the unit cost, right? We directly find the minimum
among three options, right? If we're inserting one
element to one the cells, we add the number of EDs by 1, right? If we'd delete one from one of the series,
we add the operation by one. And then if we're just
substituting the current elements, XI and YJ,
then we're actually adding the cost. This cost is 1 if the two elements,
if the two items are different. If the cost is 0,
if the two elements are the same, right? So you can see that in DW, there is actually a unit
cost no matter what, right? Why?
Because Xi and YJ are real numbers, right? Instead of category items,
so this is the fixed cost. The cost only depends on
the difference between the current observations of XI and YJ. And the edit distance, right,
the cost is not a unit cost, right? It depends on whether you're
inserting one element or deleting one element or
substituting one element. So if XI and YJ are the same,
then the cost is 0. If XI and YJ different,
then the cost is 1, right? So you can see that one
difference between the DW and ED distance is that one
uses the fixed cost and then one uses a cost net depends on XI and
YJ. But what we have in common is that they
are both starting from three options and three options corresponding
to the three neighbor cells. One to the left, one to the top,
and the one to the upper left. For those who are interested in pseudo
codes, right, you can actually compare the pseudocode of dynamic time warping and
language thing edit distance. I'm not going to go through the details,
right? From the slides, you can actually see
that most of the parts are the same because they're essentially
just filling the table, right? So they have two things
different in pseudocode. One is in the initialization,
and the other is, of course, the cost, right, as we introduce early. The unitization in DTW basically
ask you to assign the infinity, and in fact, it's the very large
value to DTW0J or DWI0, right? Why is that, right? Remember in the table,
we don't actually have a DWI0 and that's actually the Gray area, right? That's the great walk, right? And this is because,
in DTW we never go back to DTW 0. And differently, in edit distance,
we do want to go back to 0. And that means you're comparing one
sequence to empty sequence, right? So in this case, we initialize EDOJSJ and
EDI0 as I, right? In DTW, we don't do that because
we don't come here one time series to the empty time series. We have to go to DTW11 because
the first elements have to be aligned. So in reality, DTW,
dynamic time warping is not the only algorithm to find
alignments of time series. In fact, there other algorithms,
and there are more or less related to the edit
distance of sequences. One of them is called time
warp edit distance, so they even put edited into the main. Another interesting algorithm which
I strongly suggest you to read is called longest common subsequences. And this is actually very commonly used, especially when you are actually finding
the alignment of partial series, right? If you are actually searching for
subsequences but we'll not go into details of these two. If you're interested, please look
at the textbook or other materials.
