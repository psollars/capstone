Welcome back. We've talked about dimensionality reduction, and that's great if you are basically able to throw
away data in some sense. You're getting some optimized
imperfect representations that is lower dimension. But what happens if
you can't do that? What are the choices
that we have? The first choice that
we're going to think about is something
called small multiples. As I mentioned in
the intro to this, you've probably seen
small multiples and maybe not realized that
that's what they're called. This is a very general
and useful technique to basically have many, many small figures
all being displayed simultaneously that support
many different comparisons. How does this work? Let's say we have a data set like the
one that's on the screen. We have a bunch of D's, let's assume those are students. Those are different students that have been taking a test. Their scores for
the different tests are in the different columns. There was Test V1, Test V2, Test V3, variable 1, variable 2, variable 3. Each of these
basically represents the student's performance
on a particular test. We have three students
and we have five tests. How do we represent all
this data simultaneously? We could come up with some weird mash-up bar chart that has lots and lots
of different colors and lots of categories, basically depending on the test. But what we're going
to suggest instead is breaking this apart and
using small multiples. One way of doing this
is to basically support the comparison of a particular student's
performance over time. D1 is the student and
we're going to want to look at their performance for
Test 1, Test 2, and so on. This sequence of small
multiple bar charts at the bottom now, I have that. They basically are a
representation of every student. The first student, D1, you can see their performance represented in that bar chart. The next student, D2, is
the one in the middle, and D3 is the one on the right. What this is great for is
basically allowing you to compare student performance
for a specific student. Comparisons within a specific row are made easy by
this visualization. Unfortunately, it is harder to compare a particular test
over multiple students. Our eye now has to
cross and across these small multiple
visualizations, multiple lines that are
basically going to block us and make it hard for us to
read straight across, and so being able to
see how students 1, 2, and 3 all did on the fifth test becomes a
much more difficult task. To answer that, if we had
a different question, let's say we wanted to
know something about how students did given a test, we might do a different small
multiple visualization. In this case, it's a more column-focused small
multiple approach. Here, what we have
is an easiness of comparing all the students'
performance for one test. Test 1, is the visualization
in the far left, and we can easily
compare the bars representing each of the
students against each other. Our eye does not have to travel
very far to support this. However, now we have the opposite problem as we did before. If we wanted to see one student's performance
overall the tests, now our eye has to move across all these different
small multiples and that becomes a harder task. There are trade-offs
that are made when we decide on how to implement
small multiples, some things become easier and
some things become harder. Ultimately, we can show
lots more data because we have many more
visualizations to play with, but we have this limitation. A way of representing
that visually, this design consideration, how we might pick one
versus the other. Let's say we have
two different tasks. We might want to know
where we're an educator, we want to know through
some learning analytics software how a student's
grade varies over time and also how the classes' grades
are varied over time. Within a specific class,
how the students did. That's the domain-level task. Remember, we have our
high-level representation, then we have the abstract task. The data is the same, it's students and tests, and we have ids for these things. The tasks themselves,
the first one is basically comparing by the
first nominal variable, so it is, let's say
the student over time. The other one is comparing over the second nominal variable. It is the test. One is the student, the
other one is the test. If we emphasize that first task, what we might get is
one small multiple. If we emphasize the other task, we might get a very
different small multiple. It is true that these
things are both supported, so there is the ability
to answer those questions but you can see through
this dashed line that the other question, the question that we
didn't focus on with the particular production of the small multiples if we
emphasized row-based things, we can't do column-based
things very easy. If we do column-based things, we can't do row things very easy. We can still do them, so
it's still expressed, but it is not as effective. That's the trade-off that
we're making when deciding which representation to have
for the small multiples. Do we want row-based
or column-based? If you have more data, then you have to make
more trade-offs. Small multiples can mean
really, really small, so some of the examples
that we've had so far, like this one are
still fairly readable. The charts themselves
are readable. But if we go to some of
the actual small multiples that people have produced
and put in newspapers, for example, you might get something that looks
very much like this. This is drought over time
within the United States. Where are the areas
of the country that have experienced huge
amounts of drought? Each of these small
multiple plots, each of the small maps, basically represents the drought
for that particular year. Where were there areas of drought for that particular year? What's nifty about these
is that small multiples make somethings easy even
when we have really, really tiny little icons. With really tiny icons like this, you might not be able to
read like how Michigan did, for example, or how
California did. But we are able to make certain inferences
across all the data. The inferences that we can make are based on things like
pre-attentive processing. Outliers become easy to
detect because they're very different from the other
distracter signals. An outlier in this
particular case might be a particularly bad year, in which everything was drought, the entire country was
covered in drought. Another outlier in
this data might be a year in which there
were no droughts, the country is totally fine. Then there are other comparisons that we can make over time. Because of course,
we haven't laid this thing out and
I'll very long chain, but we have these
columns and rows, that becomes a little
bit more difficult, but if there were
trends in the data, we'd be able to see that as well. If there was a long sequence of droughts that
were very similar, we might be able to
detect that quite easily because of things like
pre-attentive processing. Again, if you don't
remember this, go back to the first InfoVis, set of lectures InfoVis 1 when we talked
about perception, and recall then that
pre-attentive processing makes it easy for us
to basically pull out the target image from a bunch of distractors
almost instantly. We don't have to scan across, I can take in the whole scene and we can make that
determination easily. A very simple example when it comes to small
multiples of why this works. If I ask you to find Waldo, if you know the
where's Waldo books, there's like a little character and you're going to have to find him among a bunch of
different distractors. Where's Waldo is easy if you have a where's Waldo
that looks like this. This is a small multiple,
a bunch of Waldos, and it's quite easy to
detect the target Waldo, everything else looks the same. This does not work well in this kind of real
where's Waldo scenario, where you have to find the actual where's Waldo character, and all the distractors
look very similar. Similar in that they're
all the same size, but they might have
very different colors, it's impossible to group them
together. There's nothing. Here all the distractors
are similar, and here the signal and the distractors are all similar in potentially different
from each other, it's very hard to detect. This situation might
be one at where small multiples is actually
not a great scenario. It's a difficult task because your eye has to scan across. The way you decide whether
small multiples is appropriate is you ask
the two questions. Is the target pattern obvious? Is there trend in the data? Those are two questions
that you might want to apply when using small multiples for
communicative purposes. When you've decided to
communicate a particular insight, you should ask, is the
insight pattern obvious? Is there a pattern to the data that is
part of the insight? In our running example, this is our cars dataset. We have different ways of generating small
multiple plots for that. One is to generate basically a different scatter plot for
every pair of variables. This is what's called a
SPLOM scatterplot matrix. We're going to do all comparisons and generate something
that looks like this. This is a matrix
of scatter plots. It's comparing each pair of
variables to each other. What's nice about
this is that you can easily identify outliers. You can identify
things where they're either very strong
correlations or very weak correlations
in the data, or very positive, or very
negative correlations. Those outliers tend
to be of interest. You can also find things
that are similarly behaving. All things that have a
positive correlation and you might want to target
those for further analysis. This is another example of SPLOM. This is one has color, we've added an
additional dimension. We might know something about, let's say their flowers. We might know which
species they are. We've encoded that in
this particular image, and to recover some of the functionality because some of these things might be very small, we can add in interactivity. We'll talk more
about this next week when we go through the
interactivity lectures. But you can basically add
interactivity that links between the different
small multiples to support various tasks. If you have a need to target certain pieces
of information, to do this filtering or focusing, you can basically tie that in so that interacting
with one of the small multiples will interact with all the small
multiple simultaneously. Just a few quick takeaways. We've basically
understood hopefully by now that the
more data we have, the harder it becomes to
support that visualization or visualization of that data
through one visualization, we have to find other
ways of doing it, dimensionality reduction was one. Small multiples is
another approach. We're now by using the different, basically smaller
charts we've been able to carve out the data
and partition it in a way to give us more comparisons simultaneously by having the small multiples. Of course, things become
small, potentially unreadable. We have to be careful
about their use. We also have to be careful about our decision about whether we want to partition based on
one dimension or the other. Like picking the dimension
on which we want to facet this data is going to become
a crucial consideration. This is the question that you're going to
ask yourself when making a decision about how
to generate small multiple. What is the thing that
you want to fasten on? Also, are there patterns that you care about once
you've done that? Remember, small multiples in particular, are the
very small ones, are great when you
have outliers or patterns that are very obviously of interests relative
to something else. If you have a specific target, like Waldo, and Waldo looks very different from
the rest of the plots, and it's great, if all the
plots that you've generated, they all look the same, it
may not be a great strategy. These are just some of the considerations
for small multiples. Hopefully, you get a sense
of that by also looking at some of the additional examples
that we offer for you. With that, thank
you for listening.
