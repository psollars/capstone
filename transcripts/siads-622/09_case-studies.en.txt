All right,
to wrap up our adventures through time, I'm going to focus on a few case
studies that I think are kind of cool. That are representative of different
things that you might want to do. Some of them include
multiple visualization, some of them are a little bit nonstandard,
that includes summarization and so on. But it will give you a little bit of a
taste of really sophisticated techniques. And again have to be willing to
pay the costs, the learning curve. But if you are, there are better
techniques that can be often through interactivity, support
lots of different tasks. So the first case that we're going to look
at is the case of managing your calendar. Okay, so everyone has a Google calendar or some other calendar that they're trying to
use, and you want to manage your events. And you want to manage your events
relative to other people, right? So you want to know when other people
are free, when other people are busy, should you be busy? Should you be attending
whatever talk they're going to? You want to basically have
an understanding of yourself relative to other people. So, this is going to be the domain level
task, like basically understanding your calendar and other people's
calendars relative to each other. The abstract task is identifying like if
we're trying to satisfy this need for like finding meetings, for example,
is identifying holes in event data. So where everyone has availability,
for example. And then understanding
events at different levels. So what we're going to have as a task,
as a particular task for this visualization is being able to show
the details, but also the broader context. As we're going to want to look at time
over many different kinds of levels of the hierarchy, so months,
years, weeks, days, and so on. All right, so that's the abstract tasks. So the most common way that most
people know how to do this is through things like this. So this is a very standard
Google calendar view. Here we're looking at four days,
here we've zoomed out and looked at a month's worth of data, right? So this is the same underlying
dataset just looked at in a couple of different perspectives. I want to show you a much more
sophisticated version of this. Now, this is one that was an experimental
system used at Xerox PARC. It was in 1994, so they used lots of three
dimensional stuff, which is good and bad. But it's an interesting point in time for visualization history, but
one that's interesting. This is a spiral calendar. So in the furthest back right
now it is like the year. And as you clicked on specific items,
it would pull additional visualizations, additional calendar views closer to
you that were additional details. So first you clicked on the year
from a number of years. And then you clicked on the month,
and then you clicked on the week, and then you clicked on the day, and
then you clicked on the hour. And so spiraling out from the middle out, you can basically get a sense
of both the specific data like what it is in my meeting for that
particular time in that particular day. But also the context of that
at different other points. Is that from a busy week? Is that from a busy month or
from a light month and so on? So you get all the data being shown, all the visualizations kind of being
shown dynamically as you click. So this is another visualization
from a similar series of work. This is a visualization of multiple
people's calendars simultaneously done in 3D. The way of thinking about this is
like if you take your calendar and a bunch of other people's calendars,
you can stack them on top of each other. And then put them out like floating in
space and shine a light through them so that the projection on the walls
corresponds to when people were busy or when people are free. So when there's no light being shown
through because lots of people have an event that particular
time on that particular day, that back wall will be very dark
at that particular instance. So the visualization of dates
versus hours is on the back wall. On the right wall we have
people versus hours so we can tell when specific
people are busy or not. And on the bottom we
have people versus days. So when are particular days that are good
for making meetings with people. So again, this three dimensional view is
an interesting approach because we have lots of dimensions that we
care about simultaneously. So using the additional dimensions and having that kind of interesting light
shining through and projecting basically three additional visualizations on these
back walls is kind of a neat idea. And you can interact with this and
rotate this so you can focus in on specific
visualizations or specific people. So there were lots of interactive features
that made this useful and usable. This was not intended for
sort of a static representation. All right, so
these are the different things. So events in the middle, person × times ×
day, the projection wall with dates versus hours, the people versus hours over here,
and the dates versus people on the bottom. All right, second case, this is
a different kind of domain problem. In this case, these were people who wanted
to understand the behavior of their workers in a factory. So they basically had people
coming into work during the day, leaving at certain times. And they wanted to know what were
the patterns of the factory's operation over time. So over the course of a year, what we're
sort of common trends in the data? They had again factory
workers clocking in and out. And that was the details, like sort
of the data details that they had. So abstractly what they had was the need
to correlate different times series and group time series based on similarities. So, what were the patterns of days in
which people behaved in a certain way? Were there weird outliers and so on? So one way of thinking about this data and
this is not for people checking in and out. This is for kilowatt consumption, so
the amount of energy being consumed. You have on one dimension the days,
on another dimension the hours, and then the height sort of the coloring, in that other dimension, is telling
us how much energy is being used. So this is a visualization that allows
us to see certain patterns in the data. So imagine each of these slices
corresponded to people coming in and out of the factory, right? So that was the behavior
of people during that day, the average behavior of
people during that day. So this is one way of representing that,
but it's really hard to see any
kinds of patterns in this. Because that three dimensional thing, we
have to rotate and move things around like we can't tell that there are distinct
patterns in this particular data. Because very similar patterns can be
very far away from each other in this kind of slice - this long log. Interestingly, this is not a new idea. Like this is a really,
really old example of a similar idea. People physically created time series
data and then stacked it together in this kind of weird, crazy visualization. So this is a physicalization
of the same time series data. So you can see the stack time series and
look through from different sides or move them around to see certain patterns. Okay, how did people actually solve this? So we don't want something like this. We want a condensed view that actually
allows us to see patterns in the data. So this is an award winning visualization. It's a little bit old, so
it looks a little bit older, but it's a really great technique that has
been sort of used by other people since. So you have a number of
different things on here. On the right,
you have the time series visualization. So on the x-axis,
you have the time of day. On the y-axis, you have the number
of people that are in the factory. On the left,
you have this kind of calendar view. Okay, so this is not in English, but you have the different months of the year,
and you have each of the months being displayed in a little
small multiples display. The colors correspond to
the label assigned once a clustering algorithm has been applied. So what they did was they looked at all
the time series data for all 365 days. And they found similar time series,
things that had very similar shapes and they put those into a group. So you have the orange group, and
the red group, and the green group, and whatever, okay? So the time series clusters,
you can see like maybe half a dozen, or, yeah, like maybe six or
seven of these time series, which are representative of
the entire 365 days of the year. And the same color that's assigned
to them in the visualization on the right is assigned to their label
in the calendar view on the left. All right, so I'll set 365 days on the
left and seven key patterns on the right. Colors are again linking these together. So what are some insights? The cool thing about this, and
this is why this paper is kind of great as it shows you the power of this technique
is they started looking at this data and seeing like,
what have we learned from here? So we've talked about this. So the weekdays versus weekends
are kind of the easiest thing, right? So, weekends nobody came into the factory. So you see this kind of bottom line
where no one was in the building. And you can see that visually
in the calendar view as well. Like that particular blue is kind of the
Saturday, Sunday thing where nobody is in. So that line is flat and
there's no difference there. But the other ones are a little
bit more interesting. So there's an early morning
peak in most of these, like people sort of come
in at a regular time. But in traditional office hours, like you sort of see this range like
people come in at 9 AM and leave at 5 PM. Those people who are sort of leaving
a little bit over time it's kind of this shallow slope for a traditional work day. So most of those traditional ones
you can see visually in the calendar like those are the most common
kinds of days, the orange. Holidays are a little bit different. Holidays far fewer people came in, like these were not holidays that
you were obligated to leave. The company was not closed, but
you could not come in if you wanted. And so that's a day where like
people came in around the same time, but far fewer people, and
they left much earlier. Okay, so you can see that and
knowing something about the holidays, like the sort of makes sense. There were summer Fridays so far fewer people came in on Fridays
during summer and they left early. They wanted to have a long weekend. There were some crazy outliers like
leaving early on December 5th, it's a particular kind of holiday. And so all these things, like are
identifiable using this one visualization, which has summarized a lot of
time series data into one. So instead of showing you 365 different
lines all at once, we've been able to condense them into just seven lines and
relate to them to a calendar view. With some domain knowledge,
you're able to sort of explain and understand why these things are happening. So you're able to isolate those kinds
of patterns within the visualizations, both in the calendar view and
in the time series view on the right. All right, so some consideration, some takeaways from just
these two case studies. Consider the hierarchical nature of time. This will be important in some of the
other visualizations that we'll talk about later on in the semester. But time is hierarchical,
you have years, you have months, you have weeks, you have days,
you have hours. So consider that as important
ways of condensing and scales at which people care about. Sometimes they care about one scale and
not the other, it's important to consider. Sometimes they care about all the scales,
and you have to think about the right interactive strategies to support
exploration along these multiple axes. Consider patterns, okay, so
do we care about seasonality, things happening over and
over and over again? And sometimes these
summary representations. So throwing away some of the data and condensing it into representative
views is a more powerful techniques. So 365 days is a lot, and sometimes
you have a lot more data than that. So finding ways of summarizing
your time series data so that you don't have 365
lines makes things easier. Mhm. So to summarize this entire week,
real world datasets are multifaceted. So hopefully I don't need to do
much work to convince you of that. But often we need to visualize
them in two dimensions. And so there are lots of trade offs
that we can make in order to do that. Okay, so one is using tools
like dimensionality reduction. Another is using sophisticated
visualization techniques like parallel coordinates or kind of novel glyphs. We're going to consider interactions and we're going to dive deeply
into interactions next week. So you're going to see lots of possible
ways to sort of boost the efficiency and make the learning easier for visualizations that are maybe
harder to read or harder to learn. With temporal datasets,
time is going to be hugely important in a lot of the different datasets that
you'll encounter in the real world. Most often it's time plus something else, like we rarely just have
a calendar with nothing on it. But when we do have
the time plus other data, you have to consider what's
the most important thing. Is that the data, or is it the time,
or is it some combination? Standard representations
are going to work great. People are familiar with time series
like they know how to read them. That's a thing we train in
the earliest days of pre-school now, so people know how to read
time series datasets. But there are alternatives that are also
powerful that I will encourage you to go and take a look at that might be suitable
for certain kinds of analyst tasks. Where you're willing to pay the cost
to train people on how to use them. They will get a benefit
from these techniques. All right, and with that,
thank you for listening.
