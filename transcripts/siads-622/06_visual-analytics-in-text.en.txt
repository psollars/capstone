Welcome back. I want
to spend a little bit of time working through specific kinds of domains
where people have analytics needs, like visual analytics needs,
that involve text. The first one is going to be
about social data analysis. Social media analysts
might have a need to understand key individuals within their collection of documents. If they're getting data
from Twitter or Reddit, or postings on news, blogs or whatever it is. They might want to
understand something about the people within this dataset, and so there are dimensions
that are of interest. Who sent it to whom
did they send it? What was the thing they sent? When, did they send it, all these things are of interest. The relationship of
person one to person two. Did person one sent
something to person one. When did they send it? All these cross-products
are also of interest. We'll see this common pattern, not just for social datasets, but for other datasets involving text that is a representation of the underlying
thing of interest. Whether we are a
marketing analyst a social media analyst, a criminologist, somebody working at the
CIA, a legal analyst. All these people have a need to analyze large textural collections
quickly and understand the relationship between
specific individuals or entities within that
collection, possibly overtime. We're going to start
with the social first. This is a first example. This is a slightly older
one by Viegas and Smith. Basically it was a way
of visualizing Usenet, which was an early
bulletin board system. A lot of the current
visualizations in the space take
aspects of this, and so this is a nice example of an early system
which is simple, but you'll see many
examples today of people having followed up on this and expanded and extended
it in various ways. Here's what they
wanted to understand is compared these newsgroups over time and people and how they were posting and they're
posting behavior. They wanted to visualize posts, so a specific start of a thread of today's world would be
potentially a post on Reddit. They want to understand
the thread length. They want to understand
the time over which the thread was
discussed and so on. They built a number of
different visualizations to basically explore
this dataset. This is one example. On the x-axis you have the
number of posts per thread. Each of these circles represents a particular Usenet newsgroup. You might think of them as
a different Reddit channel. Each circle represents
one of those. The number of posts per thread, how long each thread was, is represented on the
x-axis and the days active, like the amount of time, any particular topic was
discussed is on the y-axis. You can basically find
these weird outliers in the dataset or
interesting patterns or interesting correlations using this one simple
visualization. It was all interactive,
so you could click on things in order to explore the
dataset a little bit more. You could also target specific individuals and
their postings over time. This is a different
visualization. Time is on the
x-axis and you have, how much of the author, a specific person is engaging with certain threads
and not with others. In the top, you have threads that they might
be engaging with. On the bottom there are threads that they're not engaging with. You can see how they're balancing which of the topics they're talking about or engaging with within this social media system. So this is a different way of representing this particular
data or different look. All these things were connected and you can basically pivot back and forth between all these
different visualizations. Here's another example. This is a very
sophisticated, and one I'll show a video
of this in action, because it actually has a
number of different screens. As you saw in the last example, depending on the kind of
question that you have, you might have a very
different kind of representation in order to
answer those questions. Jigsaw is a system that allowed people to explore for legal data or government data
in order to find patterns. You can
watch this go. This video illustrates Jigsaw, a visual analytic system for
investigative analysis on collections of textural reports and the entities within them, such as people, places,
dates, and organizations. Jigsaw includes four
different visualizations of the report data, so a multiple monitor computer as shown here, is
very beneficial. Each view helps present
connections between entities across the
report collection. The list view presents different entity types in
scrollable vertical lists. When an entity is
selected, it turns yellow, and other entities
that are mentioned together in some
report with it are highlighted. Darker
shaded highlights indicate more connections. Each list is reorderable by alphabetic name
or frequency of appearance and
highlighted entities can be brought to the top. The scatterplot view shows
an entity type on each axis. Interaction with the view reveals individual entity names. If a row, column intersection
of two entities, say a person and an organization, appear together in a report. A small diamond representing that report is drawn
at the intersection. The view also provides range
sliders that can be used to narrow down to a smaller
region of entities. The graph view
represents entities as colored circles with reports as slightly larger white circles. Jigsaw provides incremental
graph exploration rather than static layout. Double-clicking on
an entity shows all the reports in
which it appears, while double-clicking on a
report draws all the entities contained in it as a cloud of
circles around the report. The TextView shows
reports in tabs with entities highlighted by their
color from the graph view. Actions in one Jigsaw
view propagate to others whose state
updates appropriately. Event listening also
can be turned off in a view to preserve
its visual state. Now we further illustrate
Jigsaw's use by providing a hypothetical
analysis scenario. Suppose that an analyst
has received information regarding a suspicious
person named Michael Jones. To learn more about him, the analyst displays
the list view, examines people entities, and sorts the list by frequency. Jones appears at the
second position. In order to explore people
associated with Jones, the analyst places person
entities in the second list as well and moves the people associated with Jones to the top. The color mappings imply that Martin Clark has the
strongest connection to Jones since his name is colored in a dark
shade of orange. The analyst next selects
both Clark and Jones and then puts organization
entities into a third list, which reveals that both men have connections to the
same organizations. The Revolution Now
Scholarship Fund has the strongest connections
of any organization, so the analyst continues
the exploration on it. The Text View shows two reports mentioning
the scholarship fund. Report FBI 35 mentions that
Jones donated 48,000 to the fund on the stipulation that the donation be equally
split among six students, Clark being one of them. The analyst also
notices that some of the students live
close to each other, raising suspicions of
potential collaborations. Proceeding, the
analyst next brings up the reports about Clark and
one of the other students, William Brown, because
both live in Virginia. Report FBI 41 states that
a month ago Clark and Brown took a cruise together from Hampton to Kingston, Jamaica. The report also says that two other scholarship
recipients took a cruise together from New York City to
Montego Bay last month. To more closely examine
the chronology of events, the analyst selects
the four students, switches to the
scatter plot view, and displays data entities
versus person entities. After zooming into the
relevant time range, the scatter plot
shows the timeline of events for each
of the students. Because she wants to save the current configuration
of the scatter plot view. The analyst halts
event listening in it. Now to get a deeper
understanding of the connections between
the people and places, the analyst moves
to the Graph View and displays report FBI 41. After expanding the
node for this report and filtering out
the date entities, the analyst expands the nodes representing Kingston
and Montego Bay. The view reveals that both are connected to three report nodes. The analyst selects those reports and reads them in the Text View. All three reports mentioned
the person Daniel Harris, who works in Montego Bay. The analyst issues a query on Harris that's showing the man's
entity in the Graph view. She expands his node and connections to seven
more reports show up. One report sites that Harris
traveled from Montego Bay to Kingston on December 1st and passed a package
to an unknown person. Thus, the analyst concludes that further investigations be
conducted focusing on Harris, cruise ships, and
related activities. One of the reasons
I like this example is it's showing you
lots and lots of different ways of combining different textual
visualization styles together. You can see all these different
interactions also being used as ways of pivoting
between them, filtering data, and all these different
things that we talked about earlier in
the semester about interaction techniques being
applied very effectively to basically move within one visualization and also
between visualizations. Jigsaw has a suspect of basically making certain tasks easy, focusing on targets of interests. There's an analyst who has a specific thing that
they're looking for, that is the main function of this suite of
visualization techniques they could basically
target those. There's always a variety of visualizations at very
different levels, everything forward
entity to documents. There's a focus on
certain relationships, entity to documents,
entity to entity, but there are other
things available as well. You'll see these exploration
techniques ranging from search to
interactive exploration. Just some brief takeaways, when we're thinking
about analytics in the domain of text. There are lots of relationships that we would like to explore, and people have certain
tasks that they would like to execute on
textual data in order to find patterns
or individuals or groups that are of
specific interests. This is a very deep
specific kind of search. It's not a high-level
pattern-making thing where they're trying
to understand deeper patterns in the data. It's a much more targeted
thing where they know, in most cases, specific patterns that they're looking for that often have to do with relationships
between different entities. People to people,
people to places, people to friends, to
companies, whatever. These are all different
important concepts that are related to each other. These are often temporally based, so relationships change
and so temporality is often an important area
within this analyst tools. There are analyst tools that apply to many different domains. The Jigsaw example
that you saw could equally be used within
other contexts. Some people who are doing legal document
mining, for example, they're trying to figure out
how to structure a lawsuit, might use a tool
like that and it's not just for like FBI agents. But you need to basically isolate the sub-pieces of the
tool that might be appropriate for building these other domain-specific
analyst tools. That's the main task when
you're considering how to build these environments that integrate all these
visualizations. It's picking and
choosing the right ones to match the needs of different analysts and the sub-tasks that they
have in their process. Being able to understand the process that they
have for exploration of the data and
understanding of the data and support those through visual means and connect
those in an appropriate way. With that, thank
you for listening.
