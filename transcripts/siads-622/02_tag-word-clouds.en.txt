All right. Welcome back. We're going to switch gears
right now while still keeping a focus on
single words, to a very common kind of
textual visualization. One that you've probably seen, and I've called in a
bunch of different names, tag, and word clouds. Okay. We're going to focus on these as our starting point and think about why they
might be good or bad representations of text. For whatever reason, they
exist, they're very popular. You will see many many different
examples on the web, and as I go through the
examples that I have to show, you'll see quite a few different ways that people have done this, and some of them
will be familiar. This particular
visualization that's on the screen right now
is a Flickr tag Cloud. Flickr being the image service, people would load up images
and they would put in tags, basically, metadata
associated with each image. Flickr had this
display for a while, they might still have
it, I'm not sure, but for a while, they basically displayed the tags
that were most common. This is a visualization of the most common kind of
pictures that were available
within this collection. It's a very interesting
visualization, you can quickly see
certain things popping up. The word wedding,
the word London, all these things, quickly
will catch your eye. That's great. That's
a mechanism by which you can explore the data. It was actually intended for
that purpose originally, that it was a way of jumping
into the data collection, and getting a sense of
what was available, especially because image files were equally hard to navigate. How do we get a sense of what's
in our image collection? The way they did that is by using the textual representation. This ended up being useful
for a number of reasons, but social tagging is
the first emergence of these tag and word
clouds that we see, now all over the place. Tag clouds, just as a
definition are this, the tag cloud is a visual
representation of social tags, organized into paragraph
style layouts, usually in alphabetical
order where the relative size and weight of the font for each tag corresponds to the relative
frequency of its use. Think about that for a second. You've probably recognized
this to be the case, if you've seen tag
clouds or word clouds, the height of the font
represents how common it is. The ordering is ambiguous. There are many different ways
of ordering these things. But this is the
high-level definition. These are other examples.
This is del.icio.us. This was a social
bookmarking system where people would load up their bookmarks
and also tag them. It was a mechanism by
which you could pivot. The extra encoding here, the red and the blue, correspond to tags that you use yourself for your bookmarks, versus tags that other
people have used. You can find things that
you care about within this collection quite
easily because they become very salient through
this color encoding. But you see things that
other people might care about that maybe you
haven't bookmarked at all, and might be a jumping-off
point for exploration. The word education,
for example, it's big. The word photography and
programming are quite large, and you might decide that you want to go explore those things. On the positive side, there are a number
of reasons why we might want to use tag clouds. They're compact, you can fit
lots of words on the screen. The alternatives
are not so great. This is a visualization
or four different ways of representing the passwords. These are the most common
passwords that people use. Unfortunately, the word
password 1,2,3,4,5,6, are the most common
password terms in this dataset. Don't do that. Use stronger passwords. But these are different
ways of visualizing this. In the upper left, you have the standard tag cloud, you see all the words,
you can read them. That's a great way of
representing them. You have TreeMap's style
things in the bottom left. You have a bubble map
in the lower right, and then above that,
in the upper right, you have a bar chart
style representations. You can see that, in
terms of compactness like the amount of information you can put, that's still readable. The tag clound respresentation,
word cloud representation, in the upper left, beats all
of the other systems. Even though we can say, oh, this doesn't really seem the best way of
representing the data, it's really hard to read, it turns out that the
alternatives are not so great. There is something
positive to say about word clouds as being
a great representation, when you need to compress lots
and lots of textual data, in a still readable way. So: compact, lots of words fit. The next thing is that
it draws the eye towards the most important
frequent tag or word. We also get three-dimensions
simultaneously. In most standard representation of tag clouds or word clouds, alphabetical order is what you start with. It makes sense. People would like to be able
to search if they don't know what's in the dataset, but they might have some concept of what they're looking for. Like the word photography, they should be able to find that by basically
searching through, and doing that
alphabetically makes sense. Size indicates importance,
that's that dimension. The tags themselves,
like the content of the tag, is meaningful. The words that are appearing
as instances like that, the mark on the screen
is the actual word. There are negatives to this. Okay. There are negatives that emerge in the use of word clouds, and we should acknowledge that. There are perceptual issues, which we'll talk about a
little bit more in a second. Sophisticated groupings are gone, things that are related to
each other go away. Okay. Words for all different
programming languages, for all the different
operating systems, are kind of hard. For some tasks, it was discovered that
they under-perform. There is a set of tasks and I'll point you at this paper
if you're curious. There is a subset of
search kinds of tasks where people do better with
other kinds of encoding, even though they might
have to scroll or zoom around in order to find things. You have to consider that. It turns out that this
was a problem originally, I'm not sure, it's such
an issue these days. Even the people who made
Word Clouds and use them, it was kind of a feature of the software that you
can just turn on. If you had a blog or if you installed WordPress or whatever, you can flip a switch
and suddenly you had a Word Cloud visualization
on your system. People just used it because
it was available, other people used it, too. It turns out that the developers
of these sites didn't always know what was
being displayed or shown. That was kind of potentially
problematic if you're using visualizations but don't know what's actually
being represented. Okay. To narrow
down or focus down, on the more specific issues we talked about, these
groupings problems. Meaningful associations are lost. If I put up a tag
cloud over here, Word Cloud, and I asked you to find all the
different country names. You're going to find
that difficult. You're going to have to scan through looking for these things. If I tell you to find the operating systems
that are mentioned here, similarly, you're
going to have to scan to find those things. This is going to be a
little bit problematic. The perceptual
problems are varied, but there are a number of sort of underlying processes
that are happening. If you remember back to our first InfoVis
set of lectures, we talked about
different kinds of perceptual problems and they will emerge in Word
Clouds quite often. Longer words, will grab your attention regardless
of how tall they are. Remember, it's hard to do that integral versus
separable thing when it comes to blocks. If we think of a word as being a rectangle in the
representation in a Word Cloud, the length of that block, based on the length of the word, is going to factor into your decision about
how big the word is, how important it is. Really big words like
antidisestablishmentarianism, regardless of how often
they appear in the text, are going to grab your attention, which may be undesirable. That's problem number one. Problem number two is that people often interpret
white space, so this is gestalt perception stuff. White-space implies meaning
when there isn't any. Sometimes people read that there are gaps in the text that just sort of are
happening because of the way the text is justified, or the way the text is laid out, or just the
alphabetical ordering. They'll start to see meaning in the text which isn't
actually there. They'll find these
groups and that will call their attention.
The ascenders, the letters that go tall, or descenders, like a lowercase
p that goes really low. That will also drag
your attention because it might sort of fit outside of the block and intruded in white-space or
create weird white-spaces, that you wouldn't
know of otherwise. Another thing is that when people do kind of
vision experiments when looking at Word Clouds, the eye is jumping around erratically from place to place. People have a hard time focusing because they're going
from one big thing, to the next big thing,
to the next big thing. They're not necessarily getting
a sense of all the data, they are just kind of all
over the place looking at maybe important things
which is possibly good, that's drawing their
attention to salient things. But possibly not so
great because they ignore possibly interesting
or important things, because their eye is jumping around and it's
kind of unfocused. Proximity does not hold meaning. We often expect, remember
Gestalt Principles, that things that are near each other have related meaning. But this doesn't hold when we
sort things alphabetically. The paragraph-style layout
will make things difficult for some people and they will decide that there's meaning
when there isn't any. The position within the
paragraph affects saliency. In the English language
that we read from the upper left down
to the lower right. Your eye is also going to jump. When given a Word Cloud or
kind of these Tag Clouds, your eye is going to
jump to the lower left. After you've looked at sort of the big
thing in the middle, you might start to read
from the upper left and miss things that are
important in the lower right. You might think that things
in the upper left are important because that's often the way we structure text. Visual comparisons are
going to be hard to see. It's going to be very
difficult for you to tell when we have two words that are very far away from each other, how much more important one
word is from the second. These are all
problems that emerge, as perception problems when thinking about these
kinds of encoding. There are improvements to this. The use of interaction will
often make our lives better. This is an example of an
interactive Word / Tag Cloud, that was done on Many Eyes,
which is no longer there, unfortunately, it was a
system put by IBM, which has this little
search bar at the top. In addition to being able to scan through and find the words
that you care about, you can basically type in a specific letter or
continue that into a word. It would focus down to the things that started
with that letter. Here we type the letter B
and you can see back, bloom, and so on emerge from this
collection as, being salient. So this is a way of
you to focus through interaction on specific things that you know, you're
interested in. So if you knew what word it
was that you cared about, you could start typing that in. The other thing that is now common is Word
Clouds or Wordles. Beyond that kind of
structured format where it was all in a
paragraph structure, now we have things like this, where the words are laid out in all different
kinds of directions. The nice thing about
this is that you can fit a lot more information
into one visualization, you can sort of get rid of
a lot of white-space because you can fill it in with text that you've rotated in some way. So this is an example. The alphabetical stuff goes away. Clearly, we don't have that
and there's some randomness, so the algorithms
that are used to generate this are a
little bit random. This is another example. So this is kind of
a more cloud shape without the rotation. This is in a different
language, German, I think. So Word Clouds, what
are they good for? Word Clouds are good for signaling that there
are tags or words of interest that you
might want to use as an entry point basically to jump into a textual collection. When used in that kind
of social tagging sense that you saw earlier on like the
delicious stuff, Flickr, they're often great for
showing you the difference between you as an
individual in the group. So we can have colors for
those different things. Tags that you've used
versus other people. Also, people really
like them, they're fun. So when asked like, why do you like these things? They're fun like they're
good to explore. Like you basically
can dig through them and find cool things. There's something to
be said about that. Like it is engaging it
as an engaging format. You now see people
printing these things, these Wordles on t-shirts
and selling them. You can see all
kinds of these uses for Word Clouds that extend well beyond their
original intent. In part because of
this engaging thing, people know what they
are now, they're fun. So that's great. It has also emerged over
the last few years. So originally, the academic
community was a little bit dismissive of this kind
of representation, but people have studied
ways of improving it. So given the fact that we're sort of stuck
with these things, that people use them
a lot and they're useful because of
various properties, can we eliminate sort
of the bad properties, the bad aspects of these. So this is a study
that basically looked at four different alternatives
for representing the data. What they found is
a number of things. Things that, the systems were effective in time
constraint kinds of tasks basically, and
understanding category. So if you represented the Word Clouds or Wordles
using formats like this, where they were grouped
together and colored, people could rapidly grasp
not just specific words, but specific categories because words that were related
to each other were placed near each other and colored in a way that
drew your attention. So this kind of representation or the four representations
on the screen here that are colored, would allow you
to see not just the words, but also higher-level categories, things that were
related to each other. The other thing is
that grouping could be done using a number
of different techniques. So you could use the
whitespace to your advantage. Things like the upper
left visualization or the lower left, where we've grouped things, the Gestalt principles come into play that basically
draws your eye, that's as these things are
all related to each other, there's the extra boost in this particular case because
we've also used color. You could use one or
the other or both. It turns out that the
whitespace version is preferred for analytic tasks
like the organized version. The two on the left are probably preferable
for analytical tasks. But the caveat for all this
is that the results were done when there were semantically
distinct categories. It's clear that these
words all belong together. If you had all
months in the year, so January, February, March,
April, May, whatever. All of those things were put
together or different kinds of sports are different
capital cities of different countries
were all put together. In that case, it made
sense to do this kind of grouping and that's
the data that they used in the experiment. But when you don't have these
kinds of natural groupings, when it's done on like sort of topic model or other kinds
of inferential things which may not have these very
clean kinds of distinction, these semantically
distinct categories, you might run into problems
with it because you're then creating categories visually that may not actually
exist in the data. We're gonna come
back to that later on when we talk about
reading tea leaves in text. I'll end here by just
saying that Word Clouds should be considered
pie charts for text. You should certainly
be able to use them. They're great for a
narrow set of tasks, but I do encourage the
use of them judiciously. So think about whether the
task that you have actually requires them if
the people who are using them will
benefit from them. Think about their
applications specifically, just as we would with pie charts, there are cases where
pie charts are great, so they are very effective
for certain kinds of tasks. Same thing applies
for Word Clouds. Just the takeaways.
They're problematic. Hopefully, you sort of
understood that there are perceptually problematic
things about them, but they are more effective
than many many alternatives. So when you have certain kinds of datasets, they're great. There are strategies
that can help you improve the way people read them. So that kind of grouping, color or white
space-based grouping. As I mentioned, like pie charts, there's really a
place to use them. Alright, and with that,
thank you for listening.
