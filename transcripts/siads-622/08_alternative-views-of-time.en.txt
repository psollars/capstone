Welcome back. We've talked about the standard
visualizations of time, we've also talked
about all the crazy alternative philosophical
views of time, so let me show you some
alternative views of time that are visual. This is a really simple example
but one that's elegant, where time is correlated somehow with some physical space. This is a map of New York, and what the lines on here are representing are
where people live. So the general tendency of the settlements in New York to basically move across
the space over time. Here we've overlaid time on top of another piece of data,
in this case a map. This is another example
of time-based data. In this case, it's wind
overlaid on top of a map, each of these lines represents a vague idea of wind
blowing across, and this is an animated example of this, for a
particular time point. You can see the lines moving, there's no actual
time being displayed, it is being implied in the movement of the
data over this map. You can see that
there's a lot of winds happening over the Rockies
in this particular case, whereas in the Mideast states, not much is happening, there's not a lot of wind. That animation of the data, is conveying a sense
of time, again, overlaid on top of
this geography, without having you
draw a time series. You are not drawing a line at the bottom of corresponding to the x-axis which means time; we're finding an alternative way to include time within
this visualization. Here's yet another example. This one is kind of
harder to read. This is called a
connected scatterplot. This is an example
where time is similarly not as important
as something else. In this particular case, we care about some
other two variables that are more important, that needs to be put on the scatterplot with the
x-axis and the y-axis. The lines between
those correspond to the order in which
the event happens. Let's say we're tracking
two specific things, like the height and the
weight of a person. What we might do is most simply plot height
over the x-axis, the weight over the y-axis. Then we have lots
and lots of points corresponding to
different samples, different times when we've measured that for a
particular person, height versus weight, and we draw the scatterplot
and then we connect those in order based on when we
collected that data. You can see here that
up in the upper right, there's the swing back because
whatever the value was, it happened to move
downwards and back, we moved backwards on the
x-axis and lower on the y-axis. It's a little bit hard
to understand but there are visualization
techniques, this is an example of a person basically manipulating two variables of interest, there's two variables, the green variable and the blue variable, that are being moved around. On the left visualization, they correspond to
those values over time, and the right visualization
is the connected scatterplot. As they're manipulating
those two values, the connected scatterplot
similarly changes, and so if you're
trying to understand the way a connected
scatterplot works, you can play with this
and better understand it. This again takes some training. It turns out that this is okay. Once you've trained people
on how to read this, they can read interesting
patterns in the data. Again, where time is a little bit less important than some
of the other values, than some of the other variables, we don't want to use time
on the x-axis anymore, we want to use the x-axis for something that we
consider more important, and we're going to use
those connections to basically support the kind of
temporal comparisons, that we might have been
able to ordinarily do, had we not had that constraint. Here's a related example. This is called a hurricane plot. A hurricane plot works
in a similar way. There are two variables
that we care about. In this case, we have axis
that's in the middle, corresponding to no change. Then we have to the right an increase and to
the left a decrease. As things go up, we move the point to the right, as things go down,
we move things to the left again it's
anchored in the middle. Some other variable that we
care about is on the y axis. In this case, we have increase or decrease in deaths per day. On the x-axis, we have the average number
of deaths per day. It's all data about deaths, but it's increased or decreased,
and then the average. If the line that connects to
those points - so, we measure those points at
different points in time and the line basically connects
those things together. What we might see, depending on this pattern of the
hurricane plot, is whether something is
getting worse over time or the variance is
increasing so that hurricane is spinning bigger
and bigger over time, or with bigger variances, there's bigger other things. That's an interesting way
of visualizing this data, again, with potentially
a high learning curve. There is a similar
visualization system where you can draw your time series and then see visually what the hurricane plot might look like for that. If you're interested in
understanding whether your time series is suitable
for this visualization, you can enter it and
look within that context. Again, time is
secondary in importance. We care about some other data, and the hurricane,
like that pattern itself, is telling us
something interesting. Is it moving a lot, is it moving a little, and so on. That's going to be an important distinction when we look at these visualization
and once you've been trained to detect
certain patterns, this visualization is an
interesting alternative to standard time-series
techniques. This is one that's a little bit more common and conventional, this is called a streamgraph. Very visually pleasing. There had been earlier
versions of this, but this was one of the
first versions that had a really nice algorithm that made sure that
the colors made sense, that things were flipped
in the right order. Basically, what we're
looking at here is the revenue for different
movies over time. Each of these different
colored blobs corresponds to a movie. The height of the blob relative to something else correspond. The size of the entire blob will mean how much revenue that
movie has made in total. You can find a specific movie and you look at the shape of that
thing and look at the area, and you can read, how much money that
movie has made. There's a double encoding
here in the color, so movies that made
more money are also colored a little bit more darkly. The way to read the value at any specific time point
is to just read down from where the height of that blob at that
particular point in time. That's a little bit
hard to understand. It's not normalized to any particular axis line where there's no
zero line anymore. It's the actual length between the bottom and the top of these things that tells
us something interesting. This is a really nice approach. It's visually pleasing,
you can interact, you can mouse over and
get additional detail. The problem with this is
that people find it very difficult to judge distances when data is overlaid
and this way. All these different plots on the left correspond to two
different time series. If I ask you to describe to me how much the two time series, the top versus the bottom, have changed over time. What is the distance between the top one
and the bottom one, as you move over time?
It's going to be really, really hard for you to
do this accurately. So here are three different examples
of the difference between, so if you subtract the
bottom from the top, these are the differences
between those. Can you tell me which
of these corresponds to which of the
visualizations on the left? Most people will find
it very difficult. This is, what the answer is. Again, this is because if you watch the little animation in the two upper-left plots, you'll see that
it's difficult for your eye to attract sort
of these differences. There are places where you might expect that the
difference is high, but it's just an artificial
thing because of the slope. This is where we have to be
careful about the use of this technique where it might be misleading in
terms of the differences. If that's something that you
care about the difference between these two
different time series, this visualization is
not necessarily ideal. Some of this can be
resolved through the use of inactivity
and animation. This is a not streamgraph, but a similar idea where we're plotting
something over time. In this case, it's how
people spend their day. This is hard to read again. It's hard for you
to tell me how much people eat at a particular time. Like 12:00 PM, how
much do people eat versus 1:00 PM versus
2:00 PM versus 3:00 PM. That's really hard for
you to extract from this. What they did was they added interactivity so
that if you clicked on any specific piece of
data that you cared about, it would normalize back and
down to a uniform access. The zero would become uniform. So you clicked on it
and everything would shrink down and now it becomes possible to read the behavior of that particular
dataset over time. You get the benefit of both this comparison of
these large effects. Knowing that one thing like sleep is very big in
certain times of the day, versus working versus
eating versus whatever, getting that high-level
sense but getting the fine details by
being able to isolate the time series of interest
on an axis that actually makes sense for you to read as going from zero to some value. When it comes to cyclic time, this is an alternative approach to visualizing time series data. When it comes to cyclic
time and the need to compare specific
calibrated points in time, so all Mondays or all
Januarys or all winters. We want to align the data in a way to support
that comparison. A spiral visualization is
one possible way to do it. A way of thinking
about this is if you have your long-time series, what you might do
is basically spin it along a spiral
going from the middle. In the middle what we have
is the earliest time, time 1 and as you spin outwards, follow that line outwards, you're getting the values at later and later
points in time, out to the most extreme
end of that spiral, so that we're the spiral
ends on the outside, that's when our data ends. This is a spiral visualization. By setting the tightness
of the spiral, what you can do is basically
cause data to align based on some frequency,
some seasonality. You can basically specify
that this thing turns so that all Mondays are
aligned or all winters are aligned or all every
third days are aligned. Whatever it is that you
want to align and contrast, you can basically do
that by controlling how tight this kind of spiral is. This is the same underlying data using different
spiral parameters. On the visualization on the left, it doesn't look
like there's a lot of interesting patterns. In the middle, we're starting to get a sense that maybe there's some interesting patterns and on the visualization
on the right, you can see that there
are interesting patterns. There are high values,
corresponding to that darker blue, at specific time points
going from the middle. So if you focus your
eye in the middle, you can walk outwards
along an axis which corresponds to a time point
or a seasonal time point, and you can see that all the
values are high for that. How do we pick the
right seasonality? This is where it pays to understand something
about your data or have an interactive feature. In this visualization,
you can see the spiral plot and
you can see them tweaking basically
the repetition. At 24 hours, you can see a highlight where there's lots of darks in one direction and
lots of lights in the other. Let's say this is the
amount of daylight. Clearly, there's going
to be high daylight every 12 hours corresponding
to the day and dark corresponding
to the other aspect, the dark, the middle
of the night. This is a spiral example that's
interactive to allow you to tweak the seasonality
and you can see the patterns emerging
at 24 hours, 48 hours, and so on. There are many crazy
examples of spiral charts, which I will not
encourage you to do. This is just a couple of
examples which are really nuts. You can basically use three-dimensional spirals
and overlay additional data. I will caution you that as
cool as these things look, there is a high learning curve. Be careful about picking to do visualizations
that look like this. But for some tasks, it might be totally suitable. Takeaways. There are non-standard
representations of time. Just because everyone else uses time on the x-axis and some
other value on the y-axis, doesn't mean it's
most appropriate for whatever task it
is that you have. Think about what it is that you're trying to support
for your end-users. Do they have cycles that
they need to compare? What is it that they are actually trying to get out of the data? There will be learning curves. If you use any of these
non-standard techniques, there will be learning curves. But we need to emphasize
certain things. Certainly, I would
encourage you to use these alternative
techniques and be willing to pay the upfront
learning curve cost basically, because it will make people
better in the long run. With that, thank
you for listening.
