Hi, welcome back. This is the start of a series of two
lectures that are going to be on kind of more esoteric data types and
the visualizations that make them happen. So we're going to talk about
hierarchies and networks this week, and we're going to later next week
change gears and focus on text. So hierarchical data is actually common. You probably experience it every day. This is an example from one of
my older file system snapshots. You can see the folders nested
inside of other folders. You can see files inside of those. So this is an example
of hierarchical data. You can go up and down the folders. You can find things that
are contained in other things. And this is one example of
a representation of a particular kind of hierarchical data. This is another example. This is a royal family tree. Another kind of hierarchical data. People get married, they have kids. Those kids get married,
have their own kids and so on. And that is represented
in this stylized way. This is an older diagram. And this is a much newer representation
of a similar kind of data set, another kind of family tree represented. A much more modern,
minimalist aesthetic relative to this one. This is another example of
a hierarchical data set. This is a phylogenetic tree. Probably one of the earliest
as drawn by Darwin. And the interesting thing is,
even today we are representing phylogenetic
trees, that is, which animals come from which other animals, what are the common
ancestral links using similar approaches. So this is a much more sophisticated
clearly phylogenetic tree, but basically is showing the same kind of thing that
there is an ancestor animal in the middle. And some branching that happens
as animals evolve over time. So hierarchical data basically
has this kind of structure, which is probably the most familiar
to you a tree based representation. So there is a top level node that is
connected to a bunch of lower level nodes, which is connected down at the bottom
to some nodes that we called leaves. This is a data set that
is not hierarchical. We know that it's not hierarchical because
there is a loop back to the original node, so if there are cycles
in the data structure, then we do not call this a network sorry,
we do not call this a hierarchical. We would call this
a network representation. We'll get back to that in a little bit. So this we exclude from our
definition of hierarchies. However, if the arrows were reversed then
this would also be a hierarchical data structure. In this case, we would call
this a direct acyclic graph. But it is impossible, right, to loop
back to any earlier node in the tree. So if we have something at the very top,
we can go down and down and down. But we can never go back up once we've
represented at these different kinds of levels. So both these things,
we will consider hierarchical data. Again, this is not hierarchical data,
but this is okay for network data. So hierarchical data sets are a subset
of broader class of network datasets, so network datasets will
include this definition. So we will get to networks in a moment. But just to give you some taste of
what they look like, here's an example of a flavor network extracted from
mining some some data about recipes. And these are different flavors
that go well together, and they're represented in
this network structure. So I'm using a node link
diagram representation. This is another network visualization. And here's another one. This is human diseases. All these basically are examples
of node link diagrams, and we will see alternative structures, might
already be able to infer from this is that these things can get quite messy and
complex. And so it's on us, like as designers of these things
are users of these algorithms to apply the proper layouts. So we will talk about sort of what makes
for good layouts of hierarchical and network visualizations because they can
get very complex. Very simple ones it doesn't matter. You can use whatever technique you want,
but the more complex ones with
lots of edge crossings and where the things move all over the place
become much more difficult to deal with. So the takeaways these
data sets are common and probably far more common than you think. There are lots of situations where you
can take data that may not seem either hierarchical or network and
transform it into that structure. So recommendation networks, for
example, can be extracted and defined using things like Amazon data so
we can look at people and what they buy, and what they like and
label those edges and so on. So we can build networks from lots and
lots of different data types. And then think about ways of
representing those visually. So the problem that we will encounter and try to tackle in the set of lectures
are, what are the right techniques? To do standard, plain vanilla,
simple visualizations for hierarchies and networks. But also we will try to build slightly
more sophisticated things using interaction, using data
reduction techniques and so on ]that will give us a better image of
the underlying data through visual means. All right, and with that,
thank you for listening.
