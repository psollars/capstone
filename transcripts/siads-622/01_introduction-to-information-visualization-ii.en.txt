Hello and
welcome to Information Visualization 2. In Information Visualization 1, we talked
about a number of different topics that we're going to expand on in this course. So if you remember what we essentially
tried to do in Info Vis 1 was reflect on how data is transformed through
visualizations into something that a human could look at and
ingest and basically understand. And we did that through the perspective
of a number of different tools. We looked at things like perception and
cognition. If you remember things like Weber's Law,
Steven's Law, Gestalt psychology, we talked about various design principles
and the various algorithms that we might use to produce kind of common
visualization structures. We also were very deeply interested in how
the intent of our visualization might be different than what people might perceive. So what is it that we intended to convey? What is it that people would look at and understand from the data that we
represented through visualization? And ultimately, was the data effective and expressive given the constraints
that we had and our intended design. So if you remember what we looked at in
part was how to go from a very simple question like, if I have
two different numbers and I want to support their comparison,
what is the best way to do that? So given two numbers 12 and 7, there's a very simple way of doing
it through just a simple bar chart. But we also talked about
a number of other ways, right? Like there are a zillion other kinds of
encoding techniques that we might utilize. So that was the main thrust of the first
information visualization course. We're going to change gears a little
bit in this particular class. What we're going to look at is a little
bit more specific kinds of data types. So what happens when we
have too much data or the data has some other constraint,
like it's a temporal data set. And some of the visualization
techniques that we've looked at so far really are not going to be great for
that. So in this first week, what we're going
to do is look at multidimensional and temporal data types. We're also going to look in
the second week at interactivity. So remember information visualization
is intended to be this kind of interactive practice where basically
you're manipulating stuff on the screen. So what does it mean to be interactive? What are the different
kinds of interactivity? We didn't really talk about that
in Information Visualization 1, but we're going to need it for some of the
more sophisticated data types that we're going to address in the second half
of this little series of lectures. So we're going to tackle how to visualize
hierarchical data sets and network visualizations, and then we're also going
to look at text in the last lecture. So text is kind of this really weird
thing to think about how to visualize. It has meaning and context and all this
other stuff, and we're trying to transform it into data that we can
represent on the screen somehow. So we're going to think about different
kinds of tasks that address this particular problem. Like, what are the different things that
we might want to do with textual data? How we might transform it, and then how
we might represent it on the screen? So that's largely it. We're going to jump in today and
start tackling multidimensional and temporal datasets. And with that, thank you for listening.
