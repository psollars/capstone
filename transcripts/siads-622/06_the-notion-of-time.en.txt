Welcome back. We're going to switch gears a little bit
now from dealing with multivariant data sets to dealing with one specific kind of
variable that we haven't really tackled. Much like we've kind of thought about it
a little bit when we thought about things like line charts. But we're going to talk about time, which is often a very important aspect of
multi-dimensional and multivariant data. Sets were often trying to
track things over time. This is a very common task. So this is a very early
example from the 10th century. It's a visualization time series of
the movement of certain planets. So it's sort of lost its meaning,
actually, like people don't know what this
visualization totally represents. But this is one of the earliest
example of a time series database. We have much more recent examples
where we do know what they mean. So William Playfair in
the early 1800's, started generating time
series based visualizations that look like this looking at,
kind of economic indicators over time. So, this is a very modern example. And for those of you who do anything with
stocks or look at market performance for anything. This should be very familiar. So this is a time series representation
of stock behavior, so stock price over time as well as trading volume, which
is the bar, charts down at the bottom. There's also additional marks
being displayed on here that correspond to events. So when something interesting
has happened to the stock, there's an additional kind of
thing that's being displayed. And you can see where
there's one visualization. We're actually showing three different
ways of looking at temporal data. There are the events that sort
of happened at a point in time. There are aggregate things that
are represented, in the bar charts. That's the trading volume. And there's also a very dynamic time
varying data like the stock price that is being represented in a line chart. Okay, so all those things are being
represented here using one chart. This is a different representation
of time just or temporal data set. This is,
Walgreens sales represented in a bar chart. In this case, there's some aggregation
because there are quarters, and so it often makes sense to aggregate
data in a certain way, and you'll notice that there
are a comparison being made here between two different sales within
the same organization. So this kind of visualization
temporally supports those comparisons both between the departments and
also across time. This is a more sophisticated
visualization, time series data, you can see like there's a top
visualization and they blow it up and sort of look at smaller and
smaller levels of detail. So it's very sophisticated line chart. That is giving you access to multiple, different sub pieces of the data
set basically blowing it up. And you can do this interactively,
of course, like being able to select and zoom into regions. So this is, hopefully you recognize
this is kind of the standard canonical, that is, the time series view that most
people have when they're looking at time series data. So on the x axis, you have time. Usually in most English language things or
Western language things. Time goes, to the right. So, early comes on the left and
later comes on the right, and then some value of interest,
which is being mapped on the Y axis. So some quantitative value
that's being mapped on the Y. This is really standard
representation of time series data. Tufte, in an early study of this, looked
at magazines and basically found that, of the 4000 graphics in the 15 newspapers
that you looked at in this particular time period, 75% of them had some times
series element, which is crazy, right? Like that is a huge fraction of
the graphics that appeared for communicative purposes were of data
that had a huge temporal element. Okay, so, clearly, understanding good ways
of conveying temporal information is going to be critical. I don't know if the statistics
still holds today. I assume it does. Although we see lots of other
visualizations like maps today because they're easier to produce. But 75% is probably not an unreasonable
way of thinking about this. So coming up with good strategies for doing temporal visualizations
is going to be important for us. Okay, there are different kinds
of tasks that we think about when looking at time series data. So there are things to consider, as
differences between data mining tasks and data visualization tasks,
there are some algorithmic techniques that are going to be applicable
to both our need to model time or project future values of time, but will also equally apply when
coming up with good visualization. So, for example, we might want
to do things like predict, sort of the behavior of some
variable over time. But we might also want to visualize that
and the uncertainty around that value. So we might want to have a time series
with some uncertainty at some point when we don't know the actual value
that this thing will take. And so this is going to be a thing to
consider is kind of the pre-processing that you're going to want to do and the
statistical techniques that you're going to want to apply before
you do the visualization. So it's not always the case that you're
going to have a very simple time series. Oftentimes there's going to be
transformations or predictions or normalizations that need to happen. And so that's the thing to
consider with temporal datasets. Often there's a task of exploratory data
analysis, which I don't like the term, but an analyst might want to detect
patterns within the data, so the visualizations are going
to be great for understanding. If there are common patterns,
all the stocks are going up. All the stocks are going down or there
are some stocks that are going up and some stocks that are going down. And by looking at the visualization, the analyst is able to make the
determination that there are two groups. Okay, so just visually, they're able
to see that there are two groups and then do additional analysis. There are also other kinds of tasks
that are common when looking at time series data. So when is something at
the minimum maximum? Is there a pattern? Are two series like each other? Does one of these series look
like something I expect. So my target time series goes up and then
goes down can I find all the time series that match that and basically being able
to just visually show all these different times series one can just look
at all the different images and they're really great for small multiples,
basically find the target. So if I show you a bunch of small
multiple time series that can be really, really tiny, actually like as
small as one line in the text. You can quickly find the ones that
match a pattern that you care about. So finding all the ones where the stock
is going up, we're all going down. It becomes really easy, even when it's
shrunk down to something very small. So that kind of fast access
is a great feature or a feature that's highly in demand for
time series visualizations. All right, there's a bunch of other
tasks which I won't go through. You can quickly read through them, but
basically there's very specific narrow tasks depending on the analytical
domain that you're in. Did something happen at time T? How long did something happen for,
how fast does something changing? Are there things that are happening
one right after the other? So if we're looking at like,
medical text, medical data, for example, we might want to know that, as soon as I
gave you this drug, you have this symptom. Or as soon as I gave you this drug,
the symptoms went away, or these two symptoms are correlated. So often times, we want to do that kind
of analysis with time series data and visualization techniques
might support that. Okay, takeaways,
temporal datasets are prevalent. So remember that Tufte statistic of 75%? Again, I think that's a kind of reasonable
expectation for what we see today. There are sort of conventions that
are great for representing temporal data. I'm going to talk about what happens
when we break those conventions and some alternative techniques that might
be suitable for other kinds of tasks. Oftentimes, I will point out,
as we go through these examples, there are data sets that
are time plus something else. Okay, so it's going to become
important to think about whether time is the most crucial element
of that data set or a secondary element. And just as we had to make that,
decision when we use the APT Algorithm, the algorithm that allowed
us to, order our variables and pick the right thing. This is going to become a huge
consideration with different kinds of temporal techniques. All right. And what you're going to do over the next
few of these mini lectures is built for yourself a little bit of a collection
of alternative representations. And this is just going to be a small, sample taster of basically
the larger space. If you work with temporal datasets, there are many many different kind of
esoteric and specific examples. But I'm going to try and give you a sense of sort of common
ones that you'll see multiple times. All right. And with that, thank you for listening.
