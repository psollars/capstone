Alright, welcome back. I want to
spend a little bit of time thinking through
some examples that are ways of summarizing either specific documents
or document collections. This is a very common task
that we have in text, where we want to find ways of encoding not just words, but
higher-level structures. You'll see in that many
of these examples, this necessitates finding
alternative marks. We're not actually going to use the words themselves anymore, we're going to find ways of representing documents
through circles, or rectangles or whatever it is. That will allow us a better
sense of what's in the data. When there are lots
and lots of words, lots and lots of text and
it doesn't make sense to show each individual
piece of text anymore. We'll talk about ways
that you could recover individual text-level
things in a second. But at a high level, what we're looking for is summarization through
alternative encoding strategies. The visualization that you see
on the screen right now is one that is looking at State
of the Union addresses. The President in the
United States has to give a speech in front
of Congress every year. That's just a
requirement of the job. They basically are describing everything that they've
done that year, where they think the world
is going, and so on. Each of the columns represents a specific year of a State
of the Union address. The longer the speech,
the taller that bar is. You can see in a second, each of the lines will
be the little gray line, and certain words
will pop up in red depending on the search
that's being executed. You can search within
this collection. It's also on the right pulled out a secondary visualization
that is telling you how often a specific word has appeared in
each of the years. Again, each of the columns
corresponds to a year, each of the circles represents
a word within that year, and the size of that circle, is the number of
times the word has appeared within the
speech within that year. The word Iraq, the
word bankruptcy, or whatever it is, we
can see how many times that word was used
in any given speech. Any given president or the same president
over multiple years, we can see how often they were addressing a specific topic. Here's the interactive
version of this. You can basically click around and look at
what's going on. You can also search for terms, and on the right you'll see
as the search continues, it isolates specific terms so you can contrast
them to each other. You can compare how often people mentioned Iraq over time, versus the word pandemic or
whatever it is over time. This interactive
system allows you to focus your attention
on specific words. Once you've got a sense of the broader
document collection, you can isolate more
interesting subsets. There are other document
metrics that are of interest. In the last one, it
was just word count, the number of times
that word appeared. When you're dealing with
digital humanities, there are other ways of analyzing both writers
and their creations. Things like word length,
things like syllables, things like average
sentence length, percentage of parts of speech, are they using lots
of nouns or verbs, the frequency of specific words, things come up, like this is a
crazy one, Hapax Legomenon, which is the words
that appear only once. How many times does an author use a word only once in their
document collection? People want to know, people
who study literature, want to understand these things. This is one of my
favorite visualizations actually used to analyze
textual collections. On the top, you have books by Jack London, a famous author, on the bottom you have books by Mark Twain, another
famous author. Each of the books
is represented by one of these small
multiple blobs. You can see in the upper left, you have Call of the Wild, then Children of the Frost, Iron Heel, and so on. All these are different books. This mechanism allows you to compare a bunch
of different things. First, the length or the
size of each of these blobs, each of these chunks corresponds to the length of the book. The other thing that you can see is patterns within the data, so you can tell how much different Jack London
is from Mark Twain. Here the colors are
representing sentence length. You can see that Jack London largely liked to use short
sentences in his books, whereas Mark Twain liked to
use long sentences largely. But what you can also see is interesting variations
within those things. Jack London has very different
kind of behavior in the book Jerry of the Islands, relative to the other books. Similarly, Mark Twain, over down here in the book Tom Sawyer, and the lower right, has a very different
sentence structure which is very short relative to
the rest of his writing. Even for Mark Twain
within one specific book, The Gilded Age, you can see that there are differences
within the book itself. At the top, he was using very long sentences
at the start of the book, and at the bottom, he was
using very short sentences. These are interesting patterns, they allow us to isolate
weird things within here, outliers or common trends, remember this is the benefit of having small multiple
visualizations. The way they set up this
system was that you could actually pick other criteria
so not just sentence length, you could pick paragraph length, or number of syllables
or whatever it was that you wanted to visualize, and see similar representations
that would allow you to understand the way
these authors worked. This is a visualization
of the Bible, and this is a Bible verse length being visualized here by color. This is from the Bible, the book of Genesis at the top, down to the New Testament
down at the bottom. What's interesting about this, and this is an area
of research and study about people who
worked with biblical texts, is that you can see these layers, basically different time
periods and different styles, in which different parts
of the Bible were written. The Bible was not written
all at the same time. You can see that very visually here because there are these
stylistic differences. You can see these layers, the top layer is different from the next layer and the next
layer and the next layer. People analyze this like
they analyze sort of the authorship of these
different parts of the Bible, and visually you can see
that and it's interesting. You could switch this to a
different visualization, the number of nouns,
or named entities, or whatever it was
that you wanted to study and you can see
similarly if there were any differences across these different time periods
of Biblical writing. I'll wrap up here with
just some takeaways, there are other visualizations for document summarization, but it is really an interesting and
common task when you have very large collections. As I mentioned earlier, it require this abstraction
going from the text, single words, sentences,
things that you can read, to higher-order
representations, squares, circles, whatever it is, other marks that we
will use in order to act as proxy representations for the text itself,
for the summaries. Often what you will see in the interactive
versions of these, is that details on demand will be available to basically
recover the actual text. Once you've identified areas of the summary that are interesting, you can click and basically get that additional information. With that, thank
you for listening.
