The first thing that we're going to need to
tackle when we think about advanced visualization
is basically the problem that
information visualization is usually not for data that's as simple as this
particular data-set. In this data-set, we have
three columns of interest. We have weight, acceleration, and model year and we have basically two quantitative
and one ordinal variable. If you don't remember
these ideas, I suggest you go back and
look specifically at weeks 1, and 2 in Info Viz 1 to remember
what these things mean. But we have the
quantitative weight, we have the quantitative
acceleration, and we have the ordinal
value for model year. We learned in Info Vis 1, a specific set of
techniques using this structure to take
the data that we have and basically do this greedy
algorithm based on what was the most important
piece of data in that data-set and basically
find the way to represent it. If you remember what
we start with is the APT algorithm
from Jock Mackinlay. We look at the
order of importance. Let's say the most
important thing for us was the first quantitative variables so we're going to use
position for that. Quantitative 2 is going to be the other position so
there's X and the Y, and then ordinal,
once we've done that, we cross off position, we can't use that anymore. We look then at ordinal data and we try
and figure out what's the next best thing that's available to us in
the ordinal list, and we might pick the
next thing in that list. That would be density and we get a visualization that
looks something like this, so basically a scatter-plot with
circles encoding the last ordinal value through density, so that
deepness of color. That is an approach that works well when we have a very
constrainted set of data. When we have three columns
that we care about, we can apply this
algorithm and it generates something
that's kind of reasonable, like within the set of visualization techniques
that we've already seen. Lots of scatter plots and line
charts and bar charts and that's totally cool and great and works well for this data. But if we go from
the simple example and think about what happens when we want to go beyond this and extend it to lots more data. Now we start having a problem. Now we run out of different encoding
variables that we can use. The retinal variables
that were available to us very quickly go away. We just can't use position for all these different things and we run out of things to use. If we want to visualize
all this stuff at once, we have to find other
ways of doing it. This is basically the
problem, too many of these things and too
few options for us. What we're going to
do in this set of lectures is basically cover
some alternative strategies. We're going to talk about
dimensionality reduction. Basically getting rid of some of the data or trying
to find ways of projecting lots and lots of data into two dimensions or
three dimensions at most. We're going to talk
about small multiples, which is a very common technique. Probably you've seen
it quite a lot, but maybe you haven't
recognized it as such. We're going to talk about
some novel glyph types. Basically new marks, instead of just a
circle or a square, we're going to find other ways of representing
multi-dimensional data. We're going to talk about
parallel coordinates, which is a very specific and
powerful way of visualizing multi-dimensional or
multivariate data sets in a way that necessitates
interactivity. We're going to see one of our first examples of where
interactivity becomes a crucial aspect of the information
visualization techniques that we're going to use. That's what we're going
to focus a little bit on the interaction
and how it might apply to some of these
other things and then in the next week we're
going to talk about interaction more
broadly and you'll see some additional connections
to this material. Just as a takeaway for this brief introduction is that multidimensional
data is ubiquitous. If you imagine all the data that you've probably seen in all
your other classes so far, there are lots and lots
and lots of columns. Lots and lots of
different pieces of data that we might
want to visualize potentially all at
the same time to support all the different
comparisons that we might have. The complex
multidimensional data sets will not lend themselves
to simple chart types. We won't simply be able to use one Bar chart and
get away with it. It just won't work very well. There are going to be
strategies that will apply. We're going to talk about
all these different things, reduction, small
multiples, and so on. With that, thank
you for listening. We're going to tackle
some of these one at a time going through the
next lectures. Thanks.
