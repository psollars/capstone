Welcome back. Before I give
you really specific examples, it's going to be
helpful to consider the different ways that
we can think about time. We're going to be a little
bit philosophical in this mini-lecture and consider the different models of
time and what time means. The most general way
of thinking about time is through this
algebra of tuples. We have a bunch of
data that we're going to collect at
different time points. The t here represents the time point at which
we've collected the data. It is the specific
measure like what is the wall clock time that
we measured something? Like the weight or the height or the stock
value, whatever it was. What was the time that we
took that measurement? Then the d, the data is the actual measurement or
multiple measurements. Maybe we measure both
the stocks value and the trading volume at that
particular point in time. That is a particular
representation. It's often driven by the need to understand when
specific events happen. I know when, like, different
elections happened for example. At time November
6th in this year, this election happened
and this many votes came in November 3rd. Like four years before that, there was another election with another set of an
election results. Those events become key things on which we're going to
target or basically structure our
decision-making process when it comes to looking
at the visualizations. We want to know specific
points in which something has happened
and something might be something
interesting like an election or a war or whatever it is. Any kind of thing that is significant semantically to us we might want to target that
and basically say what was the value at that
particular point in time. In most situations we have
an implicit ordering. Time A comes before B; January comes before
February or January 1st 2020 comes before January
2nd 2020 and so on. That becomes this kind of
implicit ordering that exists because time moves in a certain way and that's the
way people think about it. But here's the but, all these things break
based on specific tasks. One thing to consider
is whether we care about discrete
time or interval time. Do we care about something that happened with no duration
like it is just a measure of that particular time
point and it doesn't exist outside of that
specific instance. The time at which I started
this lecture is a time; it is an instant. The duration the length of time over which I'm talking,
that's an interval. There's a start and
an end to that. That's a different way
of looking at time. Is it a point on the time
series or is it an interval? Does it have a start
and an end time? That's one decision
point that you have to make. Another one. Are we working in linear time or are we
working in cyclic time? Linear time is one in which things happen
one after the other. That's the main consideration. Again, January 1st, 2020, January 2nd, 2020, January 3rd, 2020, that's linear time. But there are also cyclic
things when it comes to time. There are repetitions. Months repeat; January, February till next
year and then January, February and so on. We
have days of the week. A workweek is often repeated. First there's Saturday then
the Sunday then there's Monday and so on and the week starts again Saturday, Sunday. There are patterns
in the data or in the US we pay taxes
April 15th every year. Every April 15th there's
another cycle, another cycle, another cycle and so this
becomes an interesting point. Do we want to represent
all our data on one single line when we have these cycles that are
maybe more interesting? An example of cyclic time; ordinal time versus
continuous time. Do we care about the
ordering of things? This is quantitative vs
ordinal kind of discussion. Do we just care that something happened
after something else if you're planning a
wedding for example. Often times there's an
order of things that people have to do in order
to make these happen. I might just ask you did you book the caterer after or
before you booked the DJ? That might be a thing
where I only care about the order of
things but there are also continuous things that I care about
and I want to know how much distant did one
thing happen from the other? How much time elapsed between when the value was
five and when the value was 10 and in that case
I need to know the actual distances in time
between those two things. If the value five appeared at time point 2 and the
value 10 appeared at time point 3 I want to know how much further those
things were and how far those things were
far from each other instead of just A
happened after B. Another decision point;
ordinal versus continuous. The other thing then just to make things
a little bit more crazy and meta, you can have ordered time versus
branching time. Ordered time is like you have things that
happened in the past going to things that
happened in the future and it's just over
one time series. There are examples when we have branching like many possibilities like this might have happened or this other
thing might have happened. If you think about a
crazy simulation about all the possibilities
time might branch. If we represent that
kind of data we're starting at time 1 but they are different
based on our choices. We might have this kind of time 2 versus this other time 2. Just as an example here are some variants of branching time. Everything from the way Git data, for example, this is somebody
checking in code to GitHub. You can see different kinds of crazy branches over time as this, different people
are working on different forks of the
repository all at the same time. This is different; this is
an xkcd visualization of different books basically showing you what is happening to different characters
at the same time. The visualization has
basically allowed us to branch and see how
that's changed; how each character
has moved around or when they've interacted
or whatever it was. This is a chess simulation. Again, the computer is
simulating a bunch of different chess moves if you make this move and I make
this move and so on. You can see again there's
a branching time. It just is simulating all the variants that the
chess game might take. The takeaways and this was a lot, is that there are
many different ways of thinking about time
and some of it is philosophical but it's going
to be important and have a bearing towards the visualization
techniques that you saw. R is your data static
versus dynamic and here you might
have this question of, do I care about the
whole story view or maybe as it happens. Data versus event; is the data of interests do I care
that the value is five at this time or do
I only care that the value was five at
a specific time point? Which is the thing that's
actually of interest? When it happened or what the value was when
it had happened. There are conventional
versus multi-variate, so we didn't focus on that aspect a lot in this but
you do see examples where time is just
a secondary feature of the data or it's primary
feature of the data. Is it part of the
bigger set of data or is it the main thing
that's of interest? All these things are going to be important considerations when picking a specific
visualization technique. Depending on what it is that
people are trying to do, how is it that they're
thinking about time, you're going to pick one
visualization versus the other. With that, thank
you for listening.
