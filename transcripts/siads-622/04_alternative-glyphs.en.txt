Welcome back. We've talked about small multiples
in the last lecture. I want to talk about a
few ways of maybe making small multiples even better
by using novel glyph types. We can use very standard
visualization techniques like scatter plots and bar charts and whatever and that's totally fine. Even pie charts make perfectly
fine small multiples, but people have produced alternative kinds of
glyphs to represent data. Different kinds of marks to
represent data that might be a reasonable approach when it comes to small multiple
visualizations. I want to talk about
these novel glyph types and we're going to start simple. We're going to start with something called Chernoff faces, which are actually not used
that often these days. They have various
negative properties because they look
like human faces, which is both a good
idea and a bad idea. The original conception of
Chernoff faces was that people are good at recognizing differences
between human faces. Why not use that as a
way of encoding data? Herman Chernoff in
1973 had this idea, why not encode data in a face? This is a really simple
example of a Chernoff Face. You have all these
different aspects of the face that
you can manipulate, so you can manipulate
the size of the face, the arch of the eyebrow, the size of the eye, the size of the pupil, the arc of the mouth. All these things can be
manipulated and can be mapped to some underlying data. If you had something
like the car dataset, you might map the miles per gallon to the
size of the nose. Okay? The number of cylinders to the size
of the right eye. Okay. This can rapidly
get quite crazy, but this is an approach
that people have tried. For certain datasets
it's not unreasonable. Right? If you
actually have things that are human, in some cases, it makes sense,
especially emotional things where you're measuring some emotional
variables about people. It's a reasonable starting point, but we're going to have
to be careful a little bit in how we choose to
map different things. Things like skin
color, for example, become problematic or shapes of eyes become culturally
insensitive. We have to be very
careful about how we represent human data through Chernoff faces and
marginalized communities and how that might not work, but Chernoff faces are okay as a very simple starting point of thinking about alternative
glyph techniques. It doesn't need to be a face. Right? You can jump off from here and think
about alternatives, but because of faces, it's natural and easy to understand,
that's our starting point. Okay. Here's a Chernoff
face visualization of our car dataset. I've left off the
specific legend, so I'm not going to tell you
what each of these things are, but the hair, the size of the face, the shape of the face,
the color of the skin, all these things map to different variables in
our original dataset. Clearly without the legend, this is not so useful. Maybe you can see that
there's an outlier and maybe you can go and look and
see why that's interesting. Maybe you can find groups of cars and maybe look up
why they're grouped, but not knowing
anything about how that mapping has happened to because the mapping is not
really natural. Why does it make sense that miles per gallon should
be the size of the hair? That's a ridiculous thing. Learning how to map between the data and
these faces is difficult. Our use of this might be
a little bit limited and strained in particular because of
the high learning curve, but anyway this is just again
a starting point of using an alternative glyph
technique through small multiples to do
data visualization. Let me give you one
alternative that is actually in more common
use; a Star Glyph. A Star Glyph allows us to put dimensions basically
along a circle. In the middle is whatever
the zero value is. Okay? Each of these axes
going out the spokes are going to correspond to a value or variable of interest. We might have something
like the miles per gallon in going basically from
around one or two o'clock. It starts at zero in
the middle and we have the car with the
most miles per gallon, will be projected
out at the end of this spoke on the outer
where the circle is. Let's say we have a car that it's normalized miles per
gallon it's the 80 percent. On a range of 0-1, it's
0.8. It's pretty good. It has decent miles per gallon and so we're going
to project it here. Then what we do is we look at all the other variables
that we care about. This is again for the same car. We look at the displacement, how much it weighs and
how much it moves. This car might be
somewhere in the middle, and so we put a point there. Then we look at all the other variables that we care about for that car and we make a point
on each of these axes. Each of these axes represents a different variable of interest ranging from zero in the middle, the one on the outer ring. Then what we do is, we connect
these things sometimes. Some of them will look like this. You can see that there's
a line basically connecting the points
along the spoke. That polygon is a
representative of that car. A car that has the
best of everything, the highest values of
everything will have a really big polygon
on the outside. Cars that have a weakness of small value in
one of the areas, you'll see it's generally a
circular polygon except for one indentation
that goes inwards. This is a small
multiple representation of all the different cars
being projected here. You might have seen Star
glyphs used in this way, put all the cars on at once. This becomes slightly less readable for certain
kinds of data. If we had lots and lots
of different cars, for example, this
doesn't work well. If we have three cars, it's fine. The nice thing about
this is you can compare the ''general
strengths'' again in quotes and weaknesses of these different cars
based on specific things. You can easily see that the Chevy Impala has this huge displacement relative to some
of the other cars. This makes certain kinds
of comparisons easy. When there's some correlation
between the variables, visualizations like this
become even better. Then the shapes are consistent. They're either all going
to be the large circle, smaller circles and so on. Makes certain kinds of
comparisons easier, but again a reasonable
starting point using an alternative
glyph technique, again to visualize multi-dimensional,
multivariate data. All right. I've only
shown you a couple of examples of Novel Glyphs. People have proposed all kinds of others and you can
invent your own. You could make a robot
face or make a car. That's the glyph
make the wheel sizes different based on some measure. You're not constrained
in any way. You can invent your own little iconography to support this and different parts
of the iconography can map to different
pieces of the data. This is all to say
that you're aren't stuck with a standard
chart types. If you do make this choice of
using an alternative glyph, you're going to have to teach your audience how to read that. Okay? You're going to
have to explain to them how to map between what it is that they think the data
is and what it is that you're showing on the screen through different
aspects of this glyph. That's, kind of, this cost. There's learning how to use them is going to be something
that you're going to have to ask your viewer yourself to pay when you use these
alternative techniques. This notion of broken
semantics again the mapping the miles per
gallon to the size of a nose, that's a weird mapping. It breaks our semantic
understanding of what miles per gallon are
and what a nose is. Okay? That's this weird thing that is problematic for some people when they're looking
at these visualizations. They're constrained in terms
of how they think about human faces and
their inability to map that to a car, for example. You have to be a little
bit careful about choosing mappings using
familiar iconography that's already
loaded with meaning. With that thank
you for listening.
