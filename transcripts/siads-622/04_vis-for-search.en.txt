Welcome back. I'm
going to talk about a very specific and narrow task that involves text right now. This is the task of
thinking about encoding search through visual
and visualization means. Basically, the task of
search is, we have keywords, so search terms that
we're looking for and we would like to
find matching documents. You go to Google as
a very common task. Right now, most systems when
you go and you do a search, all you get back is a bunch of text snippets like just
the little descriptions of where the word appears and then maybe a sentence
or an example or two of where the word appears. Then you're asked to
make a decision about whether you want to go
explore that document or not. There are other examples
that are more sophisticated. People who are professional
librarians or others who have a deep need for understanding their
search results through other mechanisms, visualization is a mechanism by which we can support those
kinds of tasks. Why might we want to consider
visualization for search? There are a number
of things wrong with standard search
engine result pages. They don't give us a lot of information about
what's going on. They don't tell us how strong the match is to our search query. There's no indication other than it's at the top of the list. We don't know how frequently the term appears in the document, we don't know how
terms are distributed. If I search for multiple words, how are they distributed
in the document? Do they appear everywhere
or are they just in one particular small space? What's the overlap
between the terms? Are both terms that I've
searched for co-occurring in the document or is one at the top then
one is at the bottom? Which may be undesirable, or maybe it is desirable. It just depends on the task, but we don't get any
sense of that with standard search engine
results encodings. We might not know anything about the length of the document, whether we're searching for
a 500-page dissertation or a really short Wikipedia article that explains something to us. We can't tell much from the way these things
are represented today. The ranking is opaque. That's a second-order problem. Most visualization
systems or sorry, most search engine result pages have no visualization that indicates how things were ranked. Things that are at the top are
presumably more important, but we don't know how
much more important or anything else about that data. There's an inability
to compare results. A search done on day 1
and then again on day 2, we might not be able to
compare the results. Did we get something new?
Did we get something old? If we search two
different search engines, we go to two different websites, we do a search for one and
a search for the other. It's really hard to compare those sets of results
that come back. There are limits to the term relationship so
we might want to describe. Do I want documents that
mentioned both words? Or do I want to mention one word but not the other
or the other way around? It becomes really difficult
to represent conjunctions and disjunctions in standard search engine
interfaces and result pages. These are reasons
why we might choose to find other ways
of representing, visually, search engine
results and allowing people to manipulate those
through visual encodings. This is a really simple
example, very old one, that demonstrates
a very different take on search
engine result pages. Instead of just getting a long list of things
that you found, it represents each particular
search in this circle. Each circle is a search
that was issued for a particular keyword
and the Venn diagram, and you can move these
things around to look at the intersection
between these, will tell you which
documents mention, for example, sets of words. In the bottom left,
this person has said, "I want to find documents that mention all three of
these words together." The size of the circle is reflective of how
many documents match. That might be an
interesting thing. But being able to basically manipulate these things and move the circles around to
construct these Venn diagrams, is a nice way of basically
being able to identify how many results
are coming back to you and what the overlap is
between those documents. This is a particular
visualization that's narrowly focused on a subset of the
tasks I mentioned before, but is an interesting
way of doing that. This is a very different
representation of data related to search. In this case, it is a
visualization in this cloud of words that are potentially
alternative search terms. If you search for, this is Apple iPhone, you might want to
be able to identify other terms that are related as ways of exploring the space. Maybe you didn't know
the proper way to search, search engine recommendations
that currently exist in a long list at the bottom of your Google search
engine result page, might exist in this
visual format where words that are really related and possibly the next best
thing to click on, will appear next to the words
that you did search on. Apple and iPhone up here at
the center of this display, but other words that might be relevant possibly
appear next to it. That gestalts distance
thing that will kick in. Will allow you to click on
other terms and add them to your search terms basically to find the right
set of documents. If you weren't quite
getting what you wanted, this is a nice mechanism,
visually, to identify other words that you can
use to explore the space. The next one that I
want to talk about is something called TileBars. When we search for some documents or some terms in the
document collection, it's sometimes hard
for us to tell whether there are
interesting results, because the way
snippets come back, they don't really tell us, especially when we have multiple words that we're searching for, how those words
relate to each other within that structure
of that document. If there happens to be a
sentence that mentions, like, we search for three
words, there happens to be a sentence that
mentions all three words. Then maybe the search engine
will do the right thing and pull out that sentence
and show it to us, but there are maybe
other sentences that do similar things that mention
two of the three words or all three of the words and we're not going to get a sense of how rich that document is and whether it's useful to read it or not. The TileBar's task
is basically to minimize the time to decide
which documents to look at. It looks basically like this. This is a search
engine result page for three specific queries
that this person has done. Their query terms are
osteoporosis prevention research, you can see that
in the upper left. Then each row in the search
results set is the document. In this case it's just showing
the title of the document, but you could also
have the snippet, and then the TileBar visualization
that sits next to it. The way TileBar
works is like this. On this axis, the x-axis, we have these different marks. They correspond to different
pieces of the document, so maybe sentences or paragraphs. But the length the
total length of that corresponds to
the document length. If we have a really
long document, we're going to have many of
these little marks in a row. A short document
will have very few. Each of the rows themselves corresponds to a specific term, so the search engine term. Remember we searched for osteoporosis prevention research. In this particular example
that's on the screen, we only searched for two terms. We have a row for each of these
terms, Term 1 and Term 2. Each of the document blobs is represented by its own market, so this might be a paragraph, for example, each of the chunks is represented
as its own block. In this document, I don't
know, there's maybe like 10 different
paragraphs in the document. Now, the interesting
thing is the color. What the color is telling us is, how often that word appears
within that paragraph. You can see that
Term 2 which is dark black in this particular
paragraph that's pointed out, happens a lot in that
particular chunk. Term 2 happens a
lot within there. The interesting thing about
this is that you can look at this visualization
and identify places in the document where both Term 1 and Term 2 appear, or identify places
where only Term 1 appears or only Term 2 appears. That will allow you to
identify whether it's worth considering this document or
not depending on your need. Let's see how this might look. This was our original
search result, or sorry, our original query, osteoporosis
prevention research. The first document is interesting because you can see there are basically, in
the same columns, all three of those words are
being heavily activated. That means that there
are a number of paragraphs in the middle of this document that are mentioning all three
of those terms. All three of those
terms can be found within that same subset
of the document. If we wanted documents
that talked a lot about osteoporosis prevention
research as a concept, this document might be great because we've found paragraphs within there that
are actually about that topic or potentially
about that topic. In contrast, we have these documents that
are highlighted now where only one of the words
is common across all the doc, all the paragraphs
in this document so the word research appears
throughout all the paragraphs. But osteoporosis and prevention don't really happen very often, whether this document and
very rarely together. What this is telling us is if we cared about that
particular concept, osteoporosis prevention
research, that first result is probably the way to go and all the other ones
are not so great. What we can also tell
from this visualization is the length of the document. If we want a document where it's very short and
succinct and maybe like, really targeted and
maybe we wanted the second document in this list. In the second
document, those words are appearing altogether within the same paragraph
but the document itself is shorter and
maybe much more focused. We can go and click on that and explore it a little bit more. This mechanism basically
allows us to make these very quick decisions about what we want to look at next. There are a number of
advantages to this. It's a simultaneous indication of the relative document lengths.
We talked about that. The frequency of term sets in the document and
the distribution of term sets with respect to the specific document
on each other. This is all the benefits
of the TileBars. Now there are a
number of negatives. The mental model like, thinking about representing documents or paragraphs as these little icons on the screen, is sometimes
difficult for people. The other thing is
that this works really well for very linear documents. Documents you read from
one end to the other but there are many other
documents that exist that are more hyperlinked and they might have images and you might bounce around a little bit. Those may not be ideal for
that linear representation where you have all the marks appearing one after
the other in a row. Just to wrap up, visualization of search results is a
very common task. Unfortunately, one that is
not broadly implemented. Despite the fact that we know
that we need these things, most search engine result pages
look like kind of like Google. Google is the big
winner in this space. We do not, unfortunately,
see a lot of visualizations and yet
visualizations can provide in specialized
task contexts a great mechanism for
better understanding whether you got the
right documents, whether they were good documents, which document was good, whether your search is, whether your query was any
good and so on. While we don't see this much
in commercial use today, I guess I would encourage thinking about using
visualizations. If you have very specific
dashboard environments or specific contexts, where you have domain tasks, where people are willing
to basically invest the time to learn how to use
these visualization systems. You could basically be
speeding up a lot of different tasks and processes
and making them more effective by using
visual mechanisms. There are many different subtasks that one could consider. As you saw, many
different alternatives for doing these visualizations
based on whether you're looking at
sets of documents or specific documents
or specific words or some combinations
of these things. Hopefully, you get some taste of that through both this lecture and the readings that
you've been given, of different alternatives
to explore in the space. With that, thank
you for listening.
