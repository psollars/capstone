All right, I have one last point
that I want to make about text in kind of this last little mini lecture.
Text is, because it is the way it is,
we read it, we understand it, we make inferences based on it. We read a book, we read something on
the sign on the side of the road, we make inferences like that
is a tendency that we have. And because of the way text is structured
and the way we believe text should be structured,
we often make narratives from the text, regardless of whether
the narratives exist or don't. So, there are many situations where
people make visualizations of text. In this case,
this is a different kinds of documents, different kinds of papers written
in different scientific domains. And it's visualized using kind of this
dimensionality reduction technique and so you can see different documents
basically sitting near each other. And you see these little
text labels next to them and what you might be inclined to do, if you look at this and look at sort of
where similar things are sitting near each other, you might be inclined
to start telling stories. So, why is clinical therapy related to,
therapy is related to cell growth and so on,
because they're sitting near each other. That is a tendency that you're going
to have and so you're going to start narrating what it is about these
things that make them near each other. Now, the problem with
this is that sometimes it's entirely based on just
the algorithmic way the system works. So remember, with things like multi
dimensional scaling, which we've talked about earlier, there's a little
bit of an optimization problem, okay? So, we're taking many dimensions and
trying to reduce it down to two, okay? We're trying to take many aspects
of similarity or dissimilarity and reduce it down to a simple distance
between two objects in this display. But depending on how you
start this algorithm, depending on the specific kinds of
inputs that you put in the parameters that you set, you get very different
visualizations of the same data. So, these are all different visualizations
using different kinds of dimensionality reduction techniques of what's
the Stanford dissertation database. So, what they did was they looked
at all the dissertations and each of the different
departments at Stanford. So, the chemical engineering,
chemistry, electoral engineering, computer science, literature or whatever. Each of these little circles
represents a particular discipline and all the dissertations within them, the PhD
dissertations are included within them. The distance between them is intended to
reflect sort of how much word overlaps there are. Okay, so how similar is dissertations for
chemical engineering related to others? The color encoding is the higher
level department is in the college of engineering, the college of literature or
whatever it is. So, you can see certain patterns in
the data but depending on how you ran this algorithm, you're going to get three
very different visualizations. And things are going to be - things
that were close to each other in one, might be very far away from
each other in the next. And you put this in front of people and
you say, tell me a story of why these
things are next to each other and they're happy to do it, no matter
which visualization you give them. So, they're happy to tell you why these
two things are like each other, but if they're very far apart in another
visualization they'll tell you why these things are very dissimilar. And so, this is problematic because
they're basically reading tea leaves, basically making inferences off of things
that are not actually in the data, but just aspects of the algorithm. So, in response to this, the visualization
that this group came up with is this one. They said look, dimensionality reduction doesn't really
make sense when we have this kind of data where people are going to be
likely to do the wrong kinds of things. Instead, let's focus on
specific sub departments or specific areas of dissertation and put
that as kind of the central focal thing. And what that allows us to do is pull
into the center the other departments based on the similarity to that central
thing that we're going to focus on. So, if we pick like psychology and
put it in the middle, we can basically pull in all
the other departments and the distance to psychology
will actually mean something. The distance from
department to department, that is not in the central thing
doesn't mean anything anymore. So, here's what it looks
like interactively. So, you can see that they're clicking
on a specific department and it's being drawn to the center. And then all the other departments
are pulled towards that central department based on the similarity, that distance in textual similarity
that we've talked about. All right, so let me end there and
just mention a few takeaways for this and then sort of the broader aspects of text. One, remember that text is interpretable,
we often derive meaning from it and that is unfortunately, going to
cause some people to over-read and create narratives where none exist. And so, this is going to be a cautionary
note that when you're taking textual data and finding ways of encoding it visually, you have to be really cautious about
the way people are going to over-read. And basically make the incorrect
inferences based on your particular visualization encodings. Okay, so you have to be a little
bit careful about that and make decisions that are based on an
understanding of this potential over-read. So, you might have to go and
test your visualization technique and ask about what is that they're seeing and figure out whether you actually had
intended for that to happen or not. As a summary of sort of the broad week on
text, text data's everywhere hopefully, I don't need to convince you of that. But text encoding is complex, you saw lots
of examples of the different ways that we can take textual data like even specific
words or word counts and transform them. And based on that transformation,
we're going to get very, very different visualizations. So, the kind of pre processing that
you do to textual data is going to be highly important to what you
get in the final visualization. There are lots and lots of tasks for
textual data, just as there are many, many different kinds of text,
lots of tasks. Some of them will focus on words,
some of them on sentences, some of them on collections. And as you saw many different options,
we've only managed to cover a few of them. But in the beginning, I showed you
a screenshot of like a survey of all these different visualization techniques. And that is going to be
a useful set of things for you to look at as you consider
how to visualize text. Some of them will be appropriate for
certain tasks and not others. There's always going to be that need
to use the lessons that you've learned about what makes for expressive and
effective visualizations. And apply them to specific context and specific techniques to figure out whether
you're making the right decision. And finally, I want to reemphasize this,
watch for over-reading within textual collections, people naturally read and
understand text in a certain way. You want to make sure that they're reading
your visualizations in the way that you had intended. And with that, thank you for listening.
