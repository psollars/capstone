Hello, and welcome to another Postgres for
everybody walk-through. In this walk-through,
we're going to use, instead of the Python anywhere, or a Jupyter notebook, or even the terminal
on your own computer, and using P-SQL, I'm just
going to show you a way to use a high desktop application to work with your SQL database. I've already installed
this DBeaver. It's free. It's open source. It's quite amazing, and
it works pretty well. Not all of these
desktop applications work well with Postgres
databases like, there's a pgAdmin that doesn't work well because your database doesn't
have enough power, but Dbeaver seems
to work out okay. The way these navigators work, is they have what are
called connections. This can do not just Postgres, but as you'll see a
whole bunch of things. You go you find your way
into your assignment, and we're going to do this
very first assignment. I could use this in the database. Psql is a client. We're not going to
use that. Our client is going to be Dbeaver. What we're going to
do is we're going to go in the Dbeaver, and we're going to say
add another connection. It already knows about Postgres. Now if you first install it, it may have to
install some drivers. Don't worry about it. It
seems like that works just [inaudible] fine,
and what you got. You're going to go
back now to the data that you've got and the
data that you've got, I'll show that to you in a
second, is user pg.pg4e.com. That's the name of the host. The database name,
we're going to have to copy and paste that
back and forth. Database and the
user are the same. We'll do that and that. That came from your assignment. We can copy our password
and come over here, and for the password. That's literally
all you need to do. Again, we're creating a client
through which we can send, SQL commands. Here we go. We've got this, it says this
is a database connection, and within that, you can have
more than one databases, but right now we only
have one database. If you keep opening this up, you see that the
schemas, these two, the pg catalog, this has got
stuff that Postgres needs. Sometimes you'll actually
select from that. But don't had it, in the information schema. That's like its own internal
stuff, leave that alone. The place that you work
here is in this public, and we're going to
be making tables, which currently we have none. We want to run some SQL. If you a bunch of these over
here on the left-hand side, you want to have
this one selected. Then you click on this
thing that basically says, make a new SQL script. This is a script, and
the destination of the SQL commands
is that database. If we go back to
our assignment now, and we look, this Create table is the first thing that
we're supposed to do. I'll say, Create table, and then I am going
to hit the Go button. That's what this little
execute SQL statement is. Look at that. It told
us that it worked. Now if we pop this open, there's supposed to
be a table here. Maybe I need to refresh
it or something. We'll refresh the connection. Oh, somehow I lost my connection. Refresh the connection. I refreshed the connection, and then we see the pg4e debug. Now I'm going to go
and do another script. The script is right here. I'll close middle
public window there. I'll go to the next thing
I'm supposed to do. I'm going to run
another Create table, pg4e result, and I
type that in here, and then I run it. Then I go over here and I do a refresh, and I see that one. It wouldn't hurt if
it auto refreshed, but away we go, we're only
going to do a few of these. Then what we're going to do, is we've created
these two tables, and we're going to
do checking answer, which is going to check to see if our tables are created because, my Autograder is now connecting to that
database connection. At this point, if we
do another refresh, you see that this
meta table showed up just like it said
it was going to do. You've now created this. There's things you
can do and can't do, and import and export are
a little bit different. Most of the assignments
you will be able to do in this class, using either a Dbeaver, or P-SQL. I tend to focus on P-SQL because sometimes you're
working on a server and you logged into that server and you got to type the
commands and command line, and so there's nothing wrong with knowing how
to use command line, but there's also nothing
wrong with knowing how to use a more
advanced client. That was just a really
quick walk-through on how you might use Dbeaver
as your client, sometimes as a substitute for P-SQL or a compliment
P-SQL. Cheers.
