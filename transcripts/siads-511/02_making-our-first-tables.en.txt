Welcome to another walk-through
for SQL and databases. Now we're going to actually
do our first database work. I'm going into week
1 of the class. We assume that
you've already done your initial database setup
so that you have your keys, etc, although it
will remind us this. We'll use this
practice programming assignment for the notebook, and we'll talk a little
bit about connecting your database. If you want to run this
on your local computer, I would suggest you
take a look at that. But we're going to go into this graded external tool
to make our first tables. Again, this is launching
out to the outside world, and here's all of your
information and data. You got the database, it's
created, it has got a host, port, a database, a user, etc. There's a couple of
ways we can do this, but first I'm going
to do it the way we expect most of you will
do in most of the time, and that's to use this
Jupiter notebook. This is like your
terminal for the course. It's hosted in Coursera, it uses a thing
called Coursera labs, and it gives us the
opportunity to get a terminal. This runs in a terminal, this is a Linux terminal, and you can type commands. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to go to this, and this is the command
to make a connection from a Unix command line
to a PostgreSQL database. I'm going to type
that command here, and now it's going to
ask me for a password. This password is available
here, you can show it. I'm just going to
copy it straight into my paste buffer and paste that
in, and now I'm logged in. I can see what tables I've got, and because the setup
has this meta table, you can see this select, star, from pg4e_meta, and you see what it
puts it in there, it's got some information and a little signature to make sure that what we're doing is working. Just leave that alone, it's something the auto-grader
looks at and fiddles with. If we take a look at the
actual assignment that we are supposed to do
somewhere in here. Let's go back to week 1, it should pop that
up in a new tab. Let's go back to the graded external tool
making our first table. This turns out to be an assignment and you have
something that you have to do. I won't reopen this. This is an auto-grader, and if you check your answer, it's going to actually connect to your database and check to see if you've done your homework. We'll check the answer,
and I was like, oh, pg4e_debug doesn't work yet. It tells you, well, you can create this table, you have to create this table. We're going to go back
into here and we're going to run that
create table command. I can do a DT to see which
of the tables are there, so now we have two tables,
that pg4e_debug 1. This is helpful because once
you run the auto-grader, it will show you some results. I'll show you that in a second. Let's go ahead and check
our answer and get our credit for this class. We've got our credit, but
now what's cool about this pg4e_debug is you can take a look at what the auto-grader did and it's telling you the things
the auto-grader. It did it a select, it did this, blah, blah, blah,
and it all worked, and so you get a detailed
extended feedback from the auto-grader when
you are running in this, you can just see it in
auto-trader when it's running, it writes stuff into
this every time you rerun the auto-grader, ie, every time you press
check on what you got. A table, you can
optionally create because it has a little bit
of personal information, mostly your grades. Not that they're
all that sensitive, but if you create this table, which I'm going to, then the auto-grader will
actually store, this is like a funny grade-book. Now I've created that table and I'm going to check
my answer again. Now I can select, star,
from pg4e_result. What should I do? Select score, title, note from pg4e_result. You see that you got a perfect score on the
making our first tables, and that's a comment
from the auto-grader. You can make these two tables and then you get
a grade for this, and that's how it works. Now, you do not have to use this. There's a couple of other
ways that you can do this. I'm going to log out, Control D, and then I'm going to log
out of this, Control D, and then I'm going to close this and I'm going to close this. The next thing I'm going
to show you is if you wanted to run this
on your laptop, you have got to get PostgreSQL
client installed, etc. But I have that all working, so I'm going to go
into my terminal. This is my Macintosh terminal. If you have Linux
box or you could get a PostgreSQL client of one
form, another on Windows, but I type the same P-SQL command that I was typing
in Coursera labs, copy the password,
and now I can say DT. This whole thing is
accessible on the Internet. This is my Mac laptop. I can say select,
star, from pg4e_meta. It just shows that
there's a database out there and we have
multiple clients. One of the clients was
running on Coursera, and one of those clients
was running on my laptop, and they're just talking in a sense through this server right here that's sitting
up there on the Internet. I'd recommend that you use this practice programming
assignment which is really just your
terminal for your course, and what I would do is I would
make a bookmark of this, and then I would just
bookmark this right here. This bookmark here, I'd
drag it right here and have a bookmark and then I
can always come back to this page and then
match to the labs, and then poof, I'll
have my terminal. You can't bookmark disk
because it has security. I have my terminal, and I can
do my work in my terminal. I hope this was helpful. I hope this will help
you be able to run your various PostgreSQL commands
on your system. Cheers.
