Hello and welcome back. We're continuing our field trip. Now we're bringing
you to Corktown. I'm sitting in the Detroit
Institute of Bagels and I'm here with Bella. Bella, can you tell us
what do you do here? My work is the front register, so I'm a cashier person. DO you live in Detroit? I do. Just a couple of blocks
that way towards downtown. Great. Well, one of the
reasons we're here is that this part of Michigan Avenue is a
Green Light Corridor, we're doing a class project
about project Green Light. So just so we're
on the same page, I'll say a couple of things
about Project Green Light. So it's an initiative of the
city and the idea is that business owners can pay into the initiative and in exchange, they get cameras that are directly linked to the
Detroit Police Department. So an unusual thing about it is that the police can look
through the cameras at anytime. Did you know about Project Green Light
before this interview? Yeah. We're pretty familiar
with it as a staff. We have a log book. So police come in and out throughout the day and will come inside
the log book, and then they will ask
us if anything has been going on or anything to note. So I'm familiar with
it through that, but other than that, no outside knowledge of
the program in entirety. Sure. Yeah. So because project Green Light produces
this priority businesses, if you're a part of
it, then I think if you weren't a Project
Green Light Business, you wouldn't have the police coming in to sign that logbook. I'm just saying that
for the students watching the video at home. Yeah. So one of the things that's been controversial
about project Green Light is that the city has admitted that they use
facial recognition system. So the way that would work is that if you ever got an
ID card in Michigan, your photo is in a database. Then as you walk in any area of the city that has
Green Light cameras, it's possible for a computer to identify you and to
identify your movements. Was that something that
you've heard about before? No clue that that
was a thing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, how do you react to it? How
do you feel about it? The first instinctual reaction is you're a little
uncomfortable, like, "Oh my gosh, they know my
face," but you have a state ID. So I think the shock value
of it is what hits me first. I don't want the police
to know who I am or to be able to recognize my
face at any given time. But I can see on
the flip side where the advantages lie,
feeling safer. But the whole idea of buying
into it is unsettling to me, like why did we get to have
it because we have money and another business doesn't
get the same opportunity. Totally had no idea about the
facial recognition system and I'm not sure how
I feel about it. My first instinct though is I'm not very comfortable with. As a Detroit resident, is crime something that
you have concerns about? I was a Wayne State student and that was definitely
talking to my parents, initially, that was
the number one topic of conversation. Are you safe? Are you living in a city? Is
everything going to be okay? I felt when 1,000 percent
safe at Wayne State, we have a great
Police Department. I've never felt safer, honestly, living on
Wayne State campus. Now that I live downtown, I'm definitely a
little more wary, I'm definitely head on a swivel. But I'd say that's how I felt on every city
I've ever been in. I'm also very blessed to be able to live in a neighborhood
that I don't really have to worry about a
lot of the horror stories. So me having that
privilege has definitely made a difference in
how safe I feel in any given environment
within Detroit city limits. But at work here, I've never not felt safe, it's a
great neighborhood. Well, thank you so
much for sharing. The only other question I have is is there any interactions that you've had
with the police or about the cameras
while you work here, that comes to mind as
particularly noteworthy? Not really. We get a
lot of Border Patrol, police officers, a lot of
first responders come in here. From the bridge to
Canada or the tunnel? Right. All the time. I've never had an
uncomfortable situation or I felt like there
was anything to note. We all feel like we're
part of a community. So they're very neighborly, we're very neighborly to each other, so it
doesn't feel like, oh, it's this outside
ominous presence, how a lot of people would feel. But I've never had a
problem, nothing to note. Your use of the word
ominous reminds me, one of the things that
people have said about project Green Light is that they find the indoor
cameras disturbing. But your business opted not
to have any indoor cameras. But it's possible when
you go around Detroit, if you go into a project
Green Light Business, there are about 500 disciplines. When you're inside eating at a restaurant or
something like that, there could be a camera linked to the police that's, I
guess, looking at you. So do you have any thoughts about your business' decision not to have
the indoor cameras? Would you prefer
the indoor cameras or not, or one way or the other? I know we do have a security
system on the inside, so it's not like I
don't feel safe, like we need an indoor
security system, we have one. It does feel a little
comforting that it's our own system
on the inside. So that initial feeling, I'm not sure how I feel
interacting with that. I think that I'd want to be more informed on how much the
facial recognition system, how much can it really divulge about who you are,
and what you're doing, and what the information is being used to actually do in order to inform my initial feeling on whether or not I'd want
the system on the inside. I think it's such a buzz phrase,
like facial recognition. We hear about it all the time
in social media and it can immediately invoke
this feeling of fear, but I think I'd just
be curious about, yes, facial recognition, the
government has our picture, they have our pictures inside our driver's license, right? Right. So how much are they using? What is it being used for? I think that I'd want to
be more informed before deciding whether or not I would feel comfortable
with that inside. Sure. I'd hope that my
managers would inform me as an employee that
this was happening, and I wasn't informed about the outside facial
recognition cameras and I'm curious about whether or
not that would have made an impact on me if
they would have said, "Hey, we'd love to hire you, but just to let you know, this
is something that we do." Just that clarity and transparency would be
something that I'd want, especially if the
cameras were inside. It makes a lot of sense.
Yeah. Just so you know, from my reading as
far as I can tell, when they first
launched the system, there weren't really
guidelines about it. But now they are supposed to only use the facial
recognition system to investigate violent crimes
in active investigations. But another problem is that
the research that I read says that facial recognition
is often inaccurate. So it's certainly possible for it to have false positives
where you would be identified as a felon when
you're not, for example. Got it. But that's all the
questions I have, unless there's anything
else you want to say. I don't think so. Thank you so much for doing this. You really saved the day. Yeah, no problem. All right.
