Hi there, I'm back. So, I have another special treat for you. I'm here with Johnny Cash
the University of Michigan Therapy Dog. Today, we're going to talk about
another trick of the trade or method relating to data science ethics. This week's trick of the trade or
method is to think about harms. Harms, I just mean the dictionary
definition, a harm is an adverse effect on something or someone, so let's let's
warm up with Johnny Cash a little bit. What?
You do Johnny Cash sit. Can you catch this in your mouth? What if I throw it? Can you catch it? Let's try it, ready? Very nice. Very good. I brought along his favorite,
I guess it's a car. Yeah, he likes it quite a bit,
you can see. [LAUGH]
Great job, buddy. That's a good one. So he's been eating a lot of treats. Let's get back to our
key topic which is harm. Normally when you think about
those who are acted upon, the stakeholders or the patient's,
you identify after that, you say, well, where are the harms and then you try to
avoid them and that's of ethical analysis. So that seems pretty straightforward and
it is, but I think the issue is that there's
a pitfall in how you think about harms. Usually people over focus on physical
harms that are really obvious. Like we don't want our system to kill
anyone and we had, and in the course, we have some examples of data science systems
that unfortunately did kill people. However, harm is also
useful to think about even if the harm is not necessarily
obvious, it's not physical. Especially the harms that are missed in
ethical analysis are often the harms that accrete over time. So I'll give you an example. Yeah, you're really into this, an example
would be that sometimes people have talked about littering and they've said,
if you if you went back in time, a hundred or two hundred years, and
you got mad at someone for littering. They wouldn't know what you were talking
about because they just wouldn't see it as necessarily that big a deal. And one issue is that if you litter you
might think that it's a very small impact that is unsightly, but it's just,
in the world is big and people are small so
you don't really have to worry about it. However, if you scale that
up to maybe the present day, so instead of dropping one
piece of plastic, let's say there were millions of people all dropping
plastic into the ocean more recently. People are concerned that that harm
might lead to sort of the extinction of large numbers of fish or the end of
ocean life, which is quite drastic. So the issue is that don't think about
the harm in terms of the one particular tiny little issue that's incremental,
think about it in terms of what if this scaled up or
society versus the individual, not just the obvious ones
like counting costs or counting debts, because that
leads you to miss a lot of harms. So, let's see, I don't have question for
you, Johnny Cash. I guess I could just ask you how
you feel about harms to this car. He's already destroyed this top part. I think he's working on the other. Let's do one last thing
before we end this segment. Do you want to you want to try and
retrieve, sit? I'm going to put this weight,
we put this right here and I see if he was going to retrieve it for
me, ready? Okay. Good boy, good boy. Are you going to retrieve? Thank you. Good job. Thank you. Okay, that's everything for today. Johnny Cash will be
back with us next week.
