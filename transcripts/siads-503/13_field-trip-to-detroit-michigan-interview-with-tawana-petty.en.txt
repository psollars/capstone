So I understand you worked with the Allied
Media, is that right? Yeah, absolutely. So Detroit
Community Technology Project is a sponsored project of
Allied Media Projects. I see. I see. I've
been a big fan of the stuff that they've
been doing years. Wonderful. You have to
come to the conference. I do. Yeah, I've been
to the conference. Nice. Okay. Hello. Welcome. Today,
we're in Detroit. We're in Detroit because we're excited to bring you on
a kind of field trip. I know that normally
you don't think of online classes as
having field trips, but we wanted to be
sure that we explore a case study that was
specific to Michigan. So we're looking at
data science ethics, but we're looking at something
that's happening locally. The reason we're doing
that is in part, we want to benefit from the
expertise of Tawana Petty. I'm here with Tawana Petty, and I think the first thing
we should do is ask you, could you introduce
yourself to our students? Tawana Petty. I direct the Data Justice Program for Detroit Community
Technology Project, and I also co-lead
our Data Bodies, which is a five-participant
research project that has now turned into
much more than that. We analyze the ways that
digital information and data is stored and leverage for the benefit or detriment
of community members. I also convene the Detroit
Digital Justice Coalition. Well, thank you so much
for being here with us, Tawana. I'm delighted. So our topic today is
Project Green Light Detroit. Could you start by just telling us what is Project Green Light? Well, Project Green Light is
a public-private partnership between Detroit
police department, city government, Comcast, Guardian Alarm Company, and local businesses that allows for these businesses and
institutions to pay a fee to be prioritized over
residents essentially. So they pay thousands of dollars to have surveillance cameras attached to their businesses and green lights attached to
those businesses as well. They're flashing
green lights that flashed 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week. So if you live next doors, one of those green lights, you can imagine is
pretty pervasive. But this system allows for
these businesses to be prioritized as priority
one businesses if a crime happens at
their institution. So I think many
people are probably familiar with cities having
surveillance cameras. So for example, I used to live in Illinois and they had flashing blue lights instead of
flashing green lights. So you see surveillance cameras outside and they have the
police logo on them sometimes. Right. What's different about
Project Green Light? Well, Project Green Light
is a particular type of situation because
it's part of what's called a Real-Time
Crime Center project, and so it accompanies, at this point, where
there is close to 600 of them in the
city of Detroit, and they are manned by police
officers, by analysts, by volunteer community members, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Officers are even able
to look at the footage from these cameras
from mobile devices. So at any point during the day, a person could
essentially see what's happening in any of
the institutions. In addition to that, as I preface earlier, these institutions
are prioritized. So if something happens
at the institution, it is a priority 1. So if you're a detriment, and a Project Green Light
institution is at detriment, then they're going to take
priority over your situation. In addition to that, with Project Green Light, there's the capability of using facial
recognition technology. So you have officers who are leveraging the footage from Project Green Light to add to a facial recognition
database that is then compiled and analyzed for
pursuit of criminals, what are considered criminals. This technology is proven
to be very inaccurate, sometimes up to 90
percent inaccurate, especially on
communities of color, predominantly black
communities, women of color, and Detroit being an
80 percent black city, that's a very difficult
situation to understand. So let me be sure I get it. It sounds like if I were in another city that had
police surveillance, these would be more
like traffic cameras, or traffic cameras on street lights or
something like that, but here in Detroit, first of all, you say that
you have to pay for it? Yes. I read that it's at least $4,000 or something like
that to get involved- Forty-six thousand dollars. Forty-six thousand dollars. Okay. You have to pay for it. Then also, it's
real-time monitoring, so the police could be looking
at it or they could not. So it's not the same as a business buying a
camera for themselves. Right. This is a direct connection
to the police department. Yes. But you don't know if
they're watching it or not? They could be watching it or they might not be watching it. Right. I mean, so when Project Green Light
started in 2016, there were about eight of them. Now, there's close to 600. So it's pretty well-known
that law enforcement in the city is overworked
and understaffed. So the narrative that officers would be able to
even watch these cameras at the level that they
are ramping them up is pretty obvious that
that wouldn't be possible. So the business owners
pay this money, but it doesn't pay for more
police to watch the cameras, it just pays for
the camera, right? It basically pays for
the semblance of safety. I mean, one of the things
that I often argue is that the conflation between safety and security is why crime
isn't being reduced. There is a lot of research to indicate that if you
resource communities, if you invest in grocery
stores, recreation centers, affordable water,
educational systems, that you can reduce crime
because young people, older people have things to do, but if you just massively
surveil a community and try to watch
them 24 hours a day, that's not going to reduce crime. Although there is
evidence to confirm that, we still continue in the city of Detroit to ramp up these cameras. In addition to that, cities all across the world are banning facial recognition, and the one difference between Detroit and these other
cities is the demographic. These cities are
predominately white, under 10 percent black
in most instances. So there is research, there's data that
proves that this is not the trajectory that
Detroit should be following. So there's a couple of things that I want to pick up on there. I mean, one of the
things that really struck me about what you said is when you said "in"
one of these businesses, you said the word "in" because I noticed when reading about Project Green Light that the businesses can install
these cameras inside, so we're not just talking about something on a street
light, is that right? Right, absolutely. So they have surveillance
cameras on the inside, they have surveillance
cameras on the outside. In addition to that, there's the stigmatizing
green light, right? Right. It's flashing 24 hours a day. So if you're visiting Detroit
or you live in Detroit, it indicates that this is what's considered a high crime area, whether or not, it is or not. So I'm just stuck on this because it seems so strange to me
that these businesses, I looked at that list of businesses and it
looks like we've got things like laundromats, but also things like schools, there are things
like liquor stores, but there are also
things like restaurants. So if I were sitting
in a restaurant, there might be a camera
looking at me that would be directly connected
to a police officer, who might or might
not be looking at it, and then it could also be connected to an algorithm that's checking my face to see if I match a database of criminals. Absolutely. So we did through my activism and
social justice work, we fought a lot of the
policies in Detroit regarding the opportunity for law
enforcement to real-time surveil. So that would mean using their mobile devices to look
at your face in real time. They're not supposed to be
able to do that because of some of the wins that we
had through our activism. I read that in the beginning, there was virtually no
procedure, is that correct? So that they could do
whatever they wanted? Absolutely. They had a
policy for two years and basically function
under what they considered a standard
operating procedure, and they had the potential to use drones with
facial recognition, traffic lights with
facial recognition, mobile devices with
facial recognition, and any of the
surveillance cameras that were installed
around the city, including green doorbell, and some of the other technology. Wow. So one of the things that strikes me about
your comments is that you mentioned that Detroit is
a particular place and a particular context for
this that might give this technology a
different meaning. So you referenced some cities. I'm from San Francisco,
the Francisco area, and in that city has been a leader in banning
facial recognition. Absolutely. Right. But then can you tell
me more about the history of Detroit that might make it different than
the other cities, like the crime rate or
relations with the police? Yeah. I think it's important to identify a particular
situation in Detroit, and that situation is a
long-standing propaganda assault. So if you think about the last 50 years of media
around the city of Detroit, it's had a particular
dominant negative narrative. So even when crime was
not high in Detroit, since the inception of the first African-American
mayor in Detroit, there has been a set standard
media image of Detroit, and so a global
perspective, I would add. So it lends to a opportunity for policy
to follow that narrative. In addition to that, the crime rate in Detroit has been going down for decades, but even when crime goes down, media coverage of crime goes up, because Detroit is
80 percent black, because this persistent
dominant negative narrative has persisted for so
long, is not questioned. Other cities have understood
that mass surveillance, facial recognition
pervasive civil liberties, pervasive privacy, but it's really
difficult to convince the world to advocate
for Detroit in that way. So even if people don't want to stand up for the civil liberties of Detroit, the technology is flawed. At the very least, you could end up
with people being incarcerated for crimes
they didn't commit, which we already know is
happening in the justice system. So it's something that at the
very least means a pause. So that technology could be at least made accurate and would not increase false positives and mass arrests of folks that
have not committed a crime. So it sounds like there's two big areas that are important. I mean, one area is that the issue of civil
liberties with the system, the concerns about privacy. But then even if you
set those aside, you're saying the evidence for
effectiveness isn't there. So for a city like Detroit to bring in technology,
mass surveillance, facial recognition, they have stingray technology which
intercepts cell phones. They're using drones. We now have the attorney
general in the city as well, to quote unquote fight crime. But no one's fighting the quality of life issues
that lead to crime. So I just think that we
have to take a pause. We have to think about
what leads to crime. We have to think
about the impact of propaganda leveraged as data. We have to think about the
impact on community members and the decisions and
policy that come from that. So if we take that deeper analysis and
we ask deeper questions. I don't think that we will be looking at a
predominantly black city with mass surveillance and
facial recognition technology. It sounds like one of the
stories you're highlighting is disinvestment in Detroit. In public services of all kinds, but maybe even in policing, disinvestment in all
cities services. I know from living nearby, that we have people here with all kinds of problems related to water in addition to
safety related to water, related to light, street
lights, for example, related to housing,
related to whether there's affordable food or commercial
opportunities, jobs. So what you're highlighting,
if I understand it, is that it might not make sense to spend government
money investing in surveillance system at the detriment of these other systems do I have that right? Absolutely, I think there's been enough research
to prove that this hard on crime mentality has not served us as a populous. So to continue in that trajectory when
there's so much evidence to the contrary is detrimental to not just Detroit and
the state of Michigan, but society as a whole. So if you look at
thriving communities, they have invested school, they have schools
that are invested in. They have recreation centers that are vibrant and accessible. They have affordable water. As an example, Detroit
supplies water to a 126 municipalities in
the state of Michigan. Those municipalities
pay wholesale rates. Detroit pays retail rates for water that's essentially
right in their backyard. So those kinds of disparities are things
that can't be ignored. The median income in
Detroit is $26,000 a year. So you're looking at
half the city making less than $26,000 a year and you're talking about mass investment in surveilling
these communities, watching these communities,
but not seeing their needs. So I think that we have
an opportunity to pause, to reflect, to think about
how we actually reduce crime, how we actually minimize the completion between
safety and security, and how we actually look
out for one another. So propaganda leveraged as data, pursuing and surveilling
and predicting crime is not something that requires a mass surveillance technology. Actually looking out
for your neighbor, knowing who lives
next door to you, ensuring people have
affordable water, ensuring children
get to school safe. That's neighborly, that's not mass surveillance,
does not technology. That's not data extraction, that's being a human being. So I'm asking as a
resident, as an activist, as a technologist,
that city government, think about those things. We have big proponents
of Project Green Light, like the current mayor. I've seen them in the press. Since they are big fans and they want to expand the project, and the project has been
going on for a few years now. Do they offer any evidence
about effectiveness? Because you said data. So are there examples of
crimes that have been solved with this
real-time monitoring or with facial recognition or is there a base of evidence or research study or anything
like that that they used to advocate that this
is a good use of money. Well, I regularly attend the board of police
commissioner meetings and I listen to the crime
stats on a regular basis, crime has not gone
down in the city. One thing that they
constantly leverage is carjacking is as an example, I would argue that if a person is functioning in that way, in a dehumanizing way, that adding a surveillance
camera is not going to magically stop them from
behaving in that way. It's just going to
move that crime. So you mean at the board
of police commissioners, they argue that
Project Green Light has reduced carjacking. Absolutely, but not
the other crimes. Okay. So there argument because Project Green Light
is in a lot of gas stations as an
example and that's the site that carjacking
tend to happen. That Project Green Light
has ended carjacking. My argument would be that
it hasn't ended carjacking. It's probably moved it to somewhere where there
isn't a surveillance camera. But that does not reduce crime. That does not address
the systemic issues that cause people to act
in a dehumanizing way. The closing of
mental institutions, the closing of schools, I could go over those
resources and things again. So putting a band-aid on
quality of life issues and hoping that they somehow disappear is not just going
to have an impact on Detroit, but the state of
Michigan as a whole, because there isn't
a magic bubble that's going to protect residents anywhere from folks who are looking for a way
to either make a living, eat a meal, or just haven't had their mental issues addressed. Now I want to be clear, mental illness does not inherently mean you're
going to commit a crime. But a lot of people
who commit crimes are suffering from some
level of mental illness. So I think that we need to
address those issues and not spend more resources on
criminalizing the community. I think your highlighting
gas stations and carjacking is interesting
because while you could say any
cameras system might have this effect of moving crime by deterring
it in one place and moving it to somewhere
where there's not a camera. In this case, the people
with cameras paid for them. Right. So that changes the
dynamic a little bit. What has been the reaction
among the business community,. Absolutely. I will
also add that in other areas where there's
cameras at businesses, there's also schools,
they're also rec centers. So that changes the
dynamic as well. But I'll also say that a lot of businesses
have been complaining. They feel like they're
paying for policing. In some instances, because
of the over-saturation, they don't feel as
though they're getting the benefit of what
they're paying. So there are a lot of, and then you have some businesses who are arguing that they didn't realize that their
community members will be surveilled on that skill, including potential use
of facial recognition. So there have been businesses
speaking up about it. I think that it's only a matter of time before this becomes yet another failed
experiment with a lot of resources tapped into it when we could be investing
in other things. That's a great point. It
reminds me of what you said earlier about
the priority system. So we have some
businesses or churches, or schools or all kinds of institutions that are
paying this premium. They expect that they get prioritization because
that's the way the system has been advertised. But just as someone who's a non-expert in
Project Green Light looking at it from the outside, it seems like the system is
designed that it will work. It is not going to improve
as you add cameras, right? Unless you add someone to watch the cameras. I mean so if. The Mayor is recently
said he wants to add 500 more cameras. Right. It's a Project GREEN LIGHT. There are 1000 traffic lights. What are the chances
that someone's actually looking at
one of these cameras? If we saturated the entire city with cameras in some ways, the chances that any
real-time policing is happening are increasingly
small, Right? They have the addition
of the mobile devices. It's essentially overtaxing
officers that are already taxed and making that a
priority through mobile device. You're looking at Officers
that are having to look at their cell
phones for this footage, in addition to the cameras that are in the
Real-Time Crime Centers. Mass surveillance
creates paranoia. Through my research, speaking to a lot of
community members, they are being
socially controlled. They don't want to participate
in particular things, they don't want to go to
particular institutions anymore. There's a feeling of being
watched everywhere you go. If you've made any
mistakes in your life, there's already a perception that you're being tracked
and monitored anyway. When you add the prevalence of these flashing green lights 24-7, walking into institutions
and knowing that everything you do is being
watched by an officer. Not just the institution, looking at their camera to
see who commits a crime, is literally as Georgetown
technologists will say, a virtual lineup, is a literal
consistent Virtual lineup. Not to mention the
fact that in the state of Michigan, since 1999, every single person who's
taken a state ID has had their ID leverage for the facial
recognition database. Is that the snap? Yes. The snap Databases. You're looking at
every single person in State of Michigan that
has an ID being in a perpetual lineup ready to
be compared to a footage, to a database, to
potential policing. I think that we just have an opportunity to
pause, to reflect, to think about the things
that actually create safety and stop this field experiment
before it gets too far. If I understand, your efforts particularly have been helpful in trying to put some constraints on the system that we have now. Yeah. I think there were concerns among community members I
read about, that, when they go into a business, they could just be going into a convenience
store to buy food, but then their face
would be matched against this snap
database from their ID automatically and they could be falsely arrested
with a false ID, or they could be arrested
for a crime that normally wouldn't produce that kind of police response,
a minor crime. I understand there's
been a push to try and put some policy or some guard rails
around the system. Is it limited to certain kinds. Can the police do
whatever they want or do they have more constraints? Yes. I'm glad you mentioned that. I'll use an example,
first of Baltimore. During the Freddie Gray protests, officers use facial
recognition technology to profile activists for parking
tickets, as an example. So what we want to head
off in Detroit and in the state of Michigan
is that potential, to profile community members for things like parking tickets. Another example is, when
Detroit police pursued a policy because they
ultimately had to pursue a policy for their use
of facial recognition. They asked for real-time
surveillance using drones, using traffic lights, using unlimited mobile devices,
surveillance cameras. They wanted to be able
to track the faces of every community member who walk the streets of Detroit. What we've been able to do is, as I referenced earlier through our advocacy is,
push against that. They're no longer able to use facial recognition on
their mobile devices. They're no longer able to
do real time tracking. Any officer who is
found to violate that policy can be criminally prosecuted and terminated
from their jobs. They are no longer
able to violate first, fourth and 14th amendment, right to privacy, due process, right to practice religion. Because some of
these cameras are in institutions like religious
practices institutions. We wanted it banned, but we wanted to minimize
at the very least, the impact that they would have using this flawed
technology that's already been proven to misidentify black
people, people of color. In addition to that, there are several
bills up for debate. They're banned in the
Senate that started off as a ban on police use
of facial recognition, is now a real-time ban. That's likely to pass. There's a five-year
Moratorium Bill in the house that's up for debate. There's also a bill in Congress that would prevent
federal funds being used for surveillance technologies
and there's also a bill up for no use of facial
recognition on public housing. In addition to that,
there's a city ordinates civilian input over government surveillance or that is up for debate in City Council. There are a lot of
things up the pike, we don't know what's
going to stick, but we're going to
try to do whatever we can to follow the
lead of places like San Francisco and other places who have effectively
banned the use of facial recognition because they recognize that there are way more flaws and negative aspects of it than there could
ever be positive. I know you've been
active nationally in the debate about
facial recognition. Do you think that a ban
is the way forward? Is that the ultimate goal? Yeah, especially in Detroit. The technology is not accurate. I would argue that we shouldn't
have the technology at all because it's
going to be misused, history is a good teacher. But if we don't get a ban, I really would like at least a Moratorium so that we can further have dialogue. I don't think community
members have been able to argue this to
struggle through it, to learn more about it, to ask the questions
that they need to ask or to even understand
the technology. Something that is so pervasive, that will have such an impact on their livelihood should at least be analyzed by community members. I think we have so much
evidence to prove that when we push forward with these things without
that scrutiny, then it causes much
more harm than good. Well, earlier in the conversation you mentioned the distinction between security and safety. Yeah. Can you say more about that? Yes. So one of the things
that I'm consistently thinking about is
how this very long, centuries long conflation
between security and safety, surveillance and safety
has pervaded our psyche. So when we think
about being unsafe, we don't think about, "Maybe I should get
a village of people around me to help
me feel more safe." We ultimately, in
this day and age, think about surveillance cameras. We think about all the
ways that we could cage ourselves in and prevent
the outside from coming in. But when I speak to young
people, ironically, they always know that the side of the street where the
neighbors know each other, that's going to be safer. The side of the
street where there's just surveillance cameras
and footage and gates and bars and windows is not going to be safe because they're
thinking about their humanity. They're thinking
about, "Who's going to know if I don't show up for work, if I don't leave the house
for work for three days? Who's going to know
if I don't come back home after school? The neighbors that are
looking out for me, not the surveillance camera." So they're thinking about
safety in a more holistic way. They're not thinking
about militarizing, policing and protecting
with cameras and gates. Ways that close you off from
knowing who each other is. So when I have the
discussions with children, almost always they go, "Well, why would that side
of the street be safe, they don't know each other. They're going right into
the garage and into their homes and looking
at their video cameras. The street that I will
feel most safe on, is where all my friends are." So I think that it's like
pausing and slowing down. It's like tapping back into our humanity and our nostalgia. Where we could think about
a time when we didn't have all these technologies that we're getting in the middle
of our interactions. I mean, earlier you
mentioned the idea that there's not a good base of evidence as to whether
these are effective or not. Right. But we still have some
business owners that are very strongly in favor
of these programs. They seem happy to
spend the money. Right. What would you say to
them? Because I know we have a polarized debate. In some of the press coverage, it does sound like there are business owners that want
to expand the project. They're excited about it. They want more cameras. There are also residents who
want more cameras and want to expand this program,
without evidence. So propaganda is often
used as data, as evidence. Just the narrative of
not feeling safe is enough to pursue those sorts of technologies and policies. I know residents who've been
in Detroit 50-60 years, who have never
experienced a crime. Not even on their street
that they live on, but they're convinced that surveillance cameras are going
to somehow create safety. The only argument
that they're giving me is that's what they
read in the media. That's what they
see on the media. One of the targets that is consistently pursued in this
debate are senior citizens. These are retired residents
who see all the news reports, who are most vulnerable. Those are the targeted
community members that the police leadership, the mayor, and others have pursue to advocate
for this program. So I'm not going to argue
that they're wrong for feeling like this is going to be something
that create safety. Is a century's long debate, is an argument that has
pervaded our psyche, and something that
we're going to have to dissect and interrogate further. One thing that I was
hoping to ask you about. Our class is about
data and computers. One of the things that
people often write about when they talk about
data and computers is that, computers are in the process of automating a lot of things
that people use to do. I've heard that as a criticism of
surveillance systems like Project Green Light, because people have argued
that Project Green Light is taking money away from
traditional policing. So actually, it degrades
the quality of policing, even though it's portrayed as a police positive
public safety project. I mean, do you think
there's any merit to that? Well, I think there's a
lot of merit to being concerned about algorithms and automation replacing many jobs. I don't think that it would replace policing
unless, of course, you have robots that
are going to respond to the crimes after
they're reported. That's another thing about
Project Green Light. It doesn't prevent the
crime from happening. It records it for
later investigation. I would argue that,
that's not safety. Do some of the residents ever say that they wish they
would rather have a police officer on the beat than a camera on the
street light though? I mean, that seems like at some level there must be
some trade off there. Like you're paying people
to watch the cameras and you're building a high tech center in the
police department, that money has to
come from somewhere. Residents are consistently at the Board of Police Commissioners asking for more officers. I see. That is something that has been an age-old debate for
a very long time. So I would argue that if
they saw more officers, they probably wouldn't
want more cameras. But we are in a
technological age. We're in an age where Detroit
police leadership and the mayor convinced
that these are going to aid them in preventing crime, and aid them in
investigating crime. So, they're willing to take this experiment to the very end, even if the evidence does not advocate
for their argument. Well, the last
question I have is, what did I forget? Are there questions that, you know I should have
asked that I didn't. Is there anything
else that we need to know about Project Green Light? Yeah. I think that Project Green Light,
facial recognition, stingray, ring surveillance, all of these things
are very dangerous. If you look at places like
China, as an example, where residents are suffering under a social credit system. Where if you don't recycle as an example and you throw your
recycling in a trash bin, those cans are monitored
by facial recognition. Your social credit
score goes down, which means that you
can be prevented from flying certain airlines, staying in certain hotels. Going to certain schools, living in certain neighborhoods. I think that Detroit has already suffered that level
of marginalization. If you add this technology
on top of that, then you're already further dehumanizing a demographic
that's suffering poverty. That's suffering
disinvestment, that are responding to
quality of life crimes. I have a comrade who says often, "Children are not violent. They're responding
to being violated." I think that we have not taken a long look at the impact that propaganda leverages
data has been used against Detroiters
for a half century. What it means to grow up in a
city where that's the case, and what impact that
has on young people. On people who are under
50-years-old in the city. You couple that with poverty and all the other things
that come with it, you're not going to
have a safe city. You're going to
have a city that's responding to being violated. Well, that's all I have.
Thank you so much for sharing this time with us
and sharing your expertise. Thank you.
