All right, so informed consent, thought to be the reason why data
scientists hate privacy [LAUGH]. Let's see how there are limits
to informed consent. And actually, as we'll see,
regulation is really moving towards a substantive approach due
to the limits that we'll discuss. So informed consent is based off of the
Fair Information Practice Principles, or FIPPs. As we saw, that was very much
an individualistic paradigm. And so given that informed consent is
an individual's, really, privacy decision, legal scholar Daniel Solove has cited both
cognitive as well as structural issues. So one cognitive is basically
that there's no way that a human could understand how their data is used. Especially as you're consenting for
data to be collected in one context, how that can be aggregated with
other data collected elsewhere. As well as how the consent ask is
framed changes people's answers. And then compared to
the structural issues of, you know, there isn't a consistent set
of options across companies. And so you have to set your different
settings with each company, as well as, again,
these issues of aggregation. And so the literature's
found that we actually have, as a society, come to suffer
from consent desensitization, where we just want to check that box so
that we can use the app. And so thinking about informed
consent in the big data era, is it really even possible to
move it throughout the life cycle of data as different data points
are aggregated with different companies? And this is on an ongoing basis as
data scientists, like yourself, are just trying out new models. So it's been raised, so is it even
possible to properly notify someone so that they can consent due
to the volatility? And privacy scholars Barocas and
Nissenbaum have suggested, especially in a medical setting, comparing
a medical setting to advertising. When you're at your doctor's office and
signing your HIPAA form, it isn't necessarily that you're
reading every line and agreeing to it. It's more that you're consenting to
the professional ethics that doctors are taking, through the Hippocratic
oath and just in general, the professional ethics that
are associated with the medical community. And this is a topic that we'll discuss. Is it appropriate, for example,
for data scientists to consider adopting more strongly
a professional ethics approach? And so if you think about consent
as an individualistic decision, but there is also comes to a dilemma,
as informed consent is based on the fact of respecting
an individual's right to choose. And if you go on the other
side of the spectrum and take a more substantive approach,
it becomes a bit more paternalistic. So having regulations say
that data that is collected in one context cannot
be used with another. There's a trade-off there between
respecting the rights of the individual with the community. In terms of informed consent in
the context of the information type of genetics, thinking about when one
gets their whole genome analyzed, you consider that you might have
expectations about one disease, but you still get your whole genome sequenced, and
then you learn about results from another. And this has unfortunately
been a popular phenomenon with learning about, for example,
there's literature with an example that someone thought that they had
a predisposition to one disease and then actually learned, that disease
wasn't a concern, but actually that they were at a high likelihood to
develop Alzheimer's down the line. And so that is very concerning, and how are you supposed to be able
to communicate that up front, before the test results are returned,
as you're consenting to this process? As well as distrust in minority groups. And so the video that you
watched about the Havasupai tribe from the New York Times
illustrates how minority groups with a history of discrimination
have been taken advantage of. Even when they have signed consent forms
that they didn't necessarily understand, and researchers took advantage of them. That tribe only found
out about the research, not only on the initial disease that was
stated in the informed consent forms, but as well as the research
around susceptibility to mental health issues, etc,
given their genetic profiles. And it's only because one of
the members of the tribe, I believe, was a PhD student and
happened to go to a talk. And so
only because of that did they learn. And it's important to think about how
they eventually got their data and genetic samples back,
as well as were financially compensated. However, it's only due to their
Native American sovereign status that this minority group was
able to get their data back. And so how other minority groups would not be able to be
compensated as such if issues regarding their data collection and
use were to happen to them. And more broadly,
it gets to this issue of there are a variety of different efforts
to collect and analyze genetic data, whether it's in a medical setting,
in a government setting. So the US government has
the All of Us campaign, which is an effort to get a million Americans to participate and submit their
genetic data for analysis and research. As well as you have the direct-to-consumer
genetic testing companies, of which there are more mainstream ones,
but then there are also specific companies
targeted to specific groups. And in each of those different contexts,
you get very different sampling, and how that affects then the research and
analysis that is able to be done. And so informed consent does
limit one's access to data. And understanding how different databases, marketed to different groups,
have implications for the the underlying data that is collected.
