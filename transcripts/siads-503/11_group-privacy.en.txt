So to drive home this concept of privacy in terms
of the collective, let's review group privacy. This is bordering on the
discussion of discrimination that will be discussed down
the line in this course. But it's important to
consider how one's privacy is related to the disclosures or the data collected by others. Barocas and Levy, two privacy
scholars out of Cornell, wrote recently an excellent paper around privacy dependencies and that there are three types. Tie-based is in the sense
of any relationship, whether that be familial or through social media data etc, there's a dependency
on people basically in your network and what they disclose and the
implications for you. So both similarity-based and difference-based are
going to be especially important to you as
data scientists as your analysis is to find the commonality or to spot
the outlier in your data. So similarity-based is to understand what are the
common characteristics, similar behaviors
across the population, and then inferring for example, another set of behaviors
that are correlated, as well as difference-based
as to who is the outlier, or that you would expect to
be in a certain population given one data point but
actually on another is distinct. So to think about these dependencies are
actually not really reliant on a large amount of people disclosing or even having data collected about them, but instead what's been termed Tyranny of the Minority by
Barocas and Nissenbaum of, you only need a small amount of disclosures to actually create issues for the majority regarding data-driven
decision-making, etc. And in another, just
point that I wanted to make is it's interesting that you think of traditionally
stigmatized groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous
that are foundational, that they preserve their
privacy and remain anonymous, and Helm has an excellent piece about how these
groups have tried to navigate moving to and creating resources for online
participants in the group, and has shown how even though
this group does the best that they can to make sure that their online
meetings are secure, etc, that there are ways to identify participants
in this group. That's in great contrast to, there's a lot of literature about the power of the internet to change the patient experience, not necessarily with alcoholism, which has support groups in real life such as
Alcoholics Anonymous that have been established since, I believe, the 1950s, versus the internet really changed the experience
for folks with HIV, with breast cancer, through these online patient
groups where you would just share so much data or other information
about your experience, and how that's been a
different experience because of the lack of foundation rooted in
anonymity and privacy. So connecting these concepts of group privacy to my
favorite information type of genetics yet again, there are implications for crime as well as personalized
medical treatment. If you think about
how genetic data of course is intrinsically you, but also indicates
relationships with others as well as propensity
for disease, the risk of privacy dependencies, especially in terms of crime and personalized
medical treatment, become apparent, but
it is not foolproof. Recent research has found that recipients of bone
marrow transplants actually take on the data of the bone marrow that
they've received. So it isn't
necessarily foolproof, but thinking about, for example, the tie-based
privacy dependencies that Barocas and Levy discussed, they actually do a case study on the second half
of their article, I think it's why I liked it
so much, about genetics. So thinking about tie-based
dependencies is how, for example, crime is solved, for example with the
Golden State Killer, finding a long-lost
relative that had similar genetic data showing
that there was a tie. As well as in the similarity-based
dependencies or ties, you see that, basically, personalized medical treatment, also known as precision medicine, is based off of this
specific fact that there are similarities and the genetic data of people that get certain
types of cancers, for example, and
so how to address those similarities and
how those compare, for example, and how are
those different than those people that do not
develop cancer, for example. So thinking about
how even if you are not submitting your
data to be analyzed, what are the implications, we're way past the
individualized argument of not having anything to hide, but instead, whether it's from tie-based similarity
or difference-based, there are privacy dependencies. One other thing that I
wanted to mention is how genetic data is thought to be the ultimate data type because it really
intrinsically is you, but whether someone changes their hair color and
the genetic data indicates from a crime scene that they're blonde and they've
dyed their hair black, or as I mentioned about the
bone marrow transplant. To understand, just like
as with any other data, it can be socially constructed
and it is not foolproof, so it is not necessarily
the ultimate data type.
