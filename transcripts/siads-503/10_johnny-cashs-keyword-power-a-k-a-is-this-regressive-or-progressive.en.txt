Hi there, I'm back again, and this time I
brought Johnny Cash and his favorite monkey toy, which is half destroyed.
How you doing? Johnny Cash, you want to
say hi to the students? You want your monkey
toy? He does want it, yeah, but he's polite.
Okay. All right. Sit. Get it. Maybe he doesn't
want, I don't know. Well, anyway, I'm here to talk about another
vocabulary word with you. Our word for this week is power. Power in ethical analysis is also sometimes
asked as the question, is a particular
solution regressive, or is it progressive? Those words are used in
the same way that they're used when people
talk about taxes, not necessarily when people talk about regression analysis. Regressive or progressive,
but I prefer the word power. So what I mean by power is that when you're
doing an ethical analysis, it's easy sometimes to think about maybe positive steps that you might take or
negative consequences that might result from a system. But those are always
differential depending on the power of the
people involved. So a key mistake or a pitfall that ethical
analysts makes is that they don't identify the differential of power
in the consequence. So let's say, let's
take some examples for, oh, here we go, Johnny Cash. He wants to play tug of war. So if we do a fine
or a fee of $10, everyone pays the same thing. That seems fair, but remember
that for some people, $10 seems like a lot of money, and for other people it doesn't. That's a very simple example, but there are plenty of
them in data science. I'm going to do one involving Johnny Cash if he can
relax for a second. Okay, buddy, do you want
to do your trick again? Let's do your trick. I'll
hide this monkey here. I can't throw it
because he'll chase it. Front, sit. I'm going
to ask Johnny Cash. So let's say Johnny Cash, we had a data science
system that was going to have some
consequences for someone, is going to produce some harms potentially for some
patients or stakeholders. Let's say in our discussions
at the workplace, we decided we would have a public meeting to ask people
what they thought about it and how they thought we
could address the situation. So have we done a good
job in this case, sit, of thinking about power? If you think, yes, I want you to use my
right hand with your paw, and if it's no, I want you to use my left hand, and I'll put a treat in
each hand, and ready? He's thinking about it.
Oh, he went with no, that's right, Johnny Cash, you're getting better at ethics. So as it happens in this case, we haven't really thought about the power differential at all. So I'm not saying it's not good to have public
meetings and to talk with affected constituencies about what's going
to happen to them, but rather that what
is a public meeting? It's a place where people
go who have resources, and those resources are time, they have time and interests. So if you could think about how power or whether something's regressive
or progressive, interacts with the
system you are building. So what if it was a health
system and people who were sick were more likely to be negatively
affected by the system, but sick people were sick in such a way that they couldn't
come to a public meeting. So that means that
your intervention to try and make the system better is regressive in that it's emphasizing the voices
of some over others. Now, I'm not saying you
shouldn't have public meetings, you should have public meetings, but you have to think about how there's always this
power differential whenever there's a consequence or even an intervention that's positive to make
the system better. It works for some
people and not others, and that's a key part
of the analysis. All right, well, thank you very much for helping
out, Johnny Cash. I see that you're really
into your monkey. I think I'm going
to let him have it, and we'll stop there. Johnny Cash, we'll
be back next week, but I'll be back
sooner. It's yours.
