Hello, I'm Christian Sandvik. I'm showing you a picture of the Civil Registry Office in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I lived for one summer in Amsterdam and I walked
by this building, but I didn't know
the story behind it. It turns out that
during World War II, buildings like these
were records offices, and I think we could reasonably
call them data centers. I mean, that's what we
would call them today. They had cabinets in them, and the cabinets were full of records about the
Dutch population. All that was probably not
of much importance to anyone until the Nazis
invaded in 1940. When the Nazis invaded
the Netherlands, they took over the
civil registries and they started
using these records. Now, the Nazis are famous
for a variety of things, but one of the things
they're well-known for is that they're well-organized
and meticulous. They used these records to identify members of
the Dutch resistance. But perhaps even
more significantly, they used these records to decide who to send to
extermination camps. They identified Jews using
records about their birth, and these registries were
central to that project. A key thing about
this story is that the Civil Registry Office was already in existence
before the Nazis invaded. Although certainly the Nazis
could make new records, they relied on the civil records that were already in existence, that the peacetime Dutch
government had already provided. I think the question that I have about this story
is that I imagine myself in the 1930s and I think what would I have done If
I were involved somehow? In the 1930s, I could be someone who worked in one of these
Registry offices. I like data. I'm
interested in it. Maybe I would be
someone who wrote questionnaires to help tabulate information about the population. I can see that happening. If that happened, and
then the Nazis invaded, and then they started using
the records that I designed, the records in the place where I worked for these terrible things, would I have done
anything about it? I'd like to think that I
would've, I'm not sure. I mean, I'd like to think that when I imagine myself in a
scenario that I'm the hero, or at least that I have something to say about it
that's interesting, but I don't know. It seems like if the records were connected with peaceful purposes, maybe it's a bridge too far
to ask that I should bear some responsibility for
their use in the Holocaust. There were people at the time
who made this connection. The Dutch Resistance bombed this registry office and other registry offices around
the country because they saw that the mere existence
of these records, the mere existence of these
data centers was furthering the Holocaust and it was key
to the Nazi war machine. They actually identified the
targets as military targets. They even passed the location of these data centers to the allies and RAF
bombers like this one, targeted records offices
as military targets. Now, in part, that
was an attempt to disrupt the Nazi administration, but it was also an attempt to slow or have hopefully
stop the Holocaust. I don't think that the bombings actually stopped the Holocaust, but I do like to think
that they did something. There's a plaque that still exists on this
street. I've walked by it. The plaque lists the
names of the people in the Dutch Resistance who
bombed this data center. They're the ones who decided that there was some
link in these records, between these records and what
was happening in the war, and they're the ones
who paid the price. Ultimately, they were
caught and executed. I think this is a good
place to start this class. I know you might not
immediately see the connection. But over the next four weeks, I hope to convince you, if you're not already
convinced that the story of the Amsterdam
Civil Registry is relevant to the kinds
of dilemmas that you will face as a professional
working in data science. Now it's true that not every data
science decision that you might make is a
life-or-death decision. I'm not saying that,
but I am saying that there are life-or-death decisions and the data science doesn't matter to really
important everyday things that affect all of us. Maybe some of the ethical
decisions will be more mundane. But in this class, we are going to discuss instances where it's safe to say that data science has killed people. We'll also discuss the
more everyday work of data scientists and how data scientists reason about ethical dilemmas and the
situations that they face. One of the things that
I wanted to start with, aside from this anecdote is the distinction
between ethics, justice, fairness,
and I could have added other words
here like morality. The reason I wanted to start
with this is to tell you, I'm not that interested
in these distinctions. This isn't a philosophy class, it's a professional ethics class that's designed to help
you, professionals reason about specific problems
that you face. So in this class, if you're curious what
the class is about, it's not necessarily
about a technical or a philosophical or a dictionary
definition of ethics, and if you want to use ethics
and justice and fairness or even other words like morality interchangeably,
that's okay. By the end of this class, I hope that I will have provided material to you that helps you participate in
the ethical debates that you face as a practitioner. The goal is to make you
informed, thoughtful, moral, and that's the kind of data scientists that we all hope that you're going to be. I should say that I think
this is a fascinating area. I think it's fascinating
because along the way, we're going to review
a lot of fiascoes, disasters, or mistakes that data scientists have
made and that makes for, I think, some compelling
storytelling. It's why I'm interested
in the area personally. I think you'll like that as well.
