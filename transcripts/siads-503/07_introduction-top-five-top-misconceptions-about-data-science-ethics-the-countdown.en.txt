In this segment, I'd like to
talk to you about what I'm calling the top misconceptions
about data science ethics. In fact, I gave it an
even punchier name, I'm going to call
it the countdown. So I don't know if
you like countdowns. There's a website that you might have seen called Listverse, which is just a website of a bunch of countdowns
and they're very silly, like 10 bizarre anomalies and conspiracies about the moon. I was trying to get
your attention and to be funny and interesting
by calling this a countdown, but I want to
emphasize it's really the important substantive
material coming for me for the rest of Week 1. So this is the stuff
you've been waiting for. The reason I call it
a countdown is in part a reference to
data science ethics. I personally think that we
are at some magical moment in data science ethics where
we're at peak countdown, because there are so many papers, and frameworks, and reports, and books, and essays that have checklists and
countdowns and lists. You might feel as I do, that by the end of this course, you can't believe
how many lists of recommendations there are
in data science ethics, everyone seems to have a top 10, a must read 5, 15 you have to do before you
go onto the next thing. You know it can be
confusing as hell because everything
little bit overlaps with something else. There isn't a big
agreement about what the top 10 list really is for
everything across domains. So I'm giving you this countdown
because I think these are really important
misconceptions about data science ethics
that we need to get through and I formatted as a countdown to try and
make it more interesting. But at the same time, I do think that this is stuff that you'll get a lot out of. I think the challenge
though is that there's going to be a lot of numbered
lists in this course. I wish there were fewer, but you'll find in the
readings for this week, for example, there'll
be another list, and the list doesn't
match my list. I mean, I want everything
to match and be consistent and be beautiful
and elegant and short, but that's not the place where data science ethics is right now. The place where it is,
it's an exciting field, it's messy, and no one really knows what the final solution
is for a lot of this stuff. So I apologize, although
it's not really my fault. I'm not the one making
all these lists, but I did make this list, so let's talk about that. So the list I made for
you is a countdown of the top 15 misconceptions
about data science ethics. As determined by me
and the teaching team, I divided it into three groups; the top five, the middle five, and the last five. The thing about this is that
I think we need to do this, but it is meaty, important material for the class. I know I keep saying that.
Why do I keep saying it? Well, I think earlier I
was telling you kind of framing material about the
class and it was meta, it was about what we
will do in the future. But this list is
really also a list of positive things that you can do and think
about in some cases. So I might frame something
as a misconception, but you could just reverse the
meaning of a lot of these, instead of thinking of
them as misconceptions, you just reverse them and say, "Well, here's
something I can do". It could be a checklist
of things to think about. So I think that these
will be useful, but it is fun to think of them as top misconceptions as well. If you ever read
philosophy books, one of the things that
the authors often do is that they put a section right in the beginning of the book that lists
their assumptions. This isn't a philosophy book. You're not reading
a philosophy book, it's not a philosophy course, but I think there's a little bit of a similarity in the motive. What I'm saying is, here are things that I'm probably not going to have time in the class to really
justify to you, they are my
assumptions coming in. But I also chose things that are very widely shared assumptions
unless I say otherwise. So I'm sharing things that
people in the community of data science ethics are most
likely going to agree with. So let's get started. How about the top five? The top five I call the basics because they're really the things that we just got to start with. I'm assuming that you have not taken a bunch
of ethics classes. So I'm sorry if you have, although not really,
I'm glad If you have. But these should be
pitched at a level where if you've never
taken a class before, you can still understand them. I'm also assuming you haven't taken that much data
science because this course appears
in our curriculum in a place where you might
be taking it without, it only has one prerequisite, so you might be taking
this course without a lot of experience
in data science. Nonetheless, some
of these examples get a little hairy and hard, but not the basics. So here's number 1. So number 1 is the misconception that
ethics is just an opinion. I just want to flag this for you because this is a misconception, if it were true, we wouldn't have anything
to have a class about. There would be no reason for a class because you'd say, "Well, this is what I think
the ethics are", and I'd say, "This is what
I think the ethics are". Then we'd nod, we'd shake hands and we go
about our business. So we don't think that ethics
is something you get to decide on your own and yours can be different from
everybody else's. I'll give an example of that, and I hope it's a compelling one. It's not about data
science I think, although perhaps everything is about data science a little bit. So maybe there's a way to
link this to data science. Now, it's a dramatic example. So as a teaching team, we are all very confident. We agree that shooting unarmed people is
wrong, all right? We totally agree with that. But there was this event
in the United States, this is a bullet actually
from that event, it's a bullet that hit a
statue on a college campus. That event was called
the Kent State Massacre. I don't know if you've
heard about it, it was in 1970. It basically was a
nonviolent protests against the Vietnam War by students in something like
the quad at Kent State. There was a group of National
Guardsmen that were there because of the protest and
they opened fire on the crowd, they killed four people, including one military officer
in training at the school, and they wounded nine
additional people. The Presidential Commission that investigated the
Kent State massacre said that there was no
justification for this action. There was no way to justify what these National
Guardsmen had done. So you might think, well, this is a pretty clear case where shooting unarmed people is wrong and the National Guard
shot a bunch of students, a position you might feel some connection to as
students yourself. It's interesting
though because at the time of the Kent
State massacre, there was a public opinion
poll that asked people in the United States what they thought of the Kent
State killings. It wasn't called a
massacre then or riots I guess, it could
have been called. The majority of people
in the United States felt like the National Guards should have shot the students. They thought, well, I'm not
sure of their reasoning, not being around then, but I think that
they thought, well, we should just trust
the National Guard, they must have had some good reason for
what they were doing. So the majority of public opinion supported shooting the students. In fact, students who
were at the protests reported that people came
up to them and said things. I'm going to read a
quote because I want to be sure I get it right. But they said that strangers
came to them to say, "More students should
have been killed". Because if more
students were shot, this would really
teach the protesters a lesson and it would
have been more effective. So what explains this? I mean, I don't know how
you're reacting to it, but my reaction to this
story is that this is crazy, this sounds really bizarre. I think the explanation is that people make bad
judgments all the time. I don't think that people are particularly good at
making ethical judgments, and that's another of
our misconceptions, but I'll get to it in a second. So we think of ethics and
we think about reasoning towards some conclusion
based on evidence. So in the example of the
Kent State massacre, there may have been
important information that the people who said, "I'm all for it, I'm all for the killings",
they didn't know. So for example, it wasn't clear that the
protesters were unarmed. So the reason I start
with this example, even though it's not really
a data science example, is that to address the misconceptions that
ethics is just an opinion, I want to highlight
the fact that, yes, people have all kinds
of different ideas about situations and whether
they're right or wrong, but that the assumption
of this class and all ethics really
is that we can reason to an answer together and that reason matters and that
evidence matters. If it didn't matter again, there's not really any
point in having this class. So the people giving
the opinions about the Kent State massacre changed their minds as new
information came out. There was a Presidential
Commission, the commission investigated, they found that the
National Guard was in the wrong and people
changed their mind. So that's the model a little bit about how we're
thinking about ethics, is that it's something that we're doing that's based on reasoning together about something
and not just an opinion. I mean, I guess I can't
emphasize this enough. The assumption implies that
reasoning can be taught. I mean, I'm going to teach you about ethical reasoning and that should lead you to think some people can be better at reasoning about
ethics than other people. So I want to make you one of the better people for
reasoning about ethics. That means that we
are assuming that ethics is about
evidence and reason and that it can be taught and
you're going to learn it, and so that's one reason why ethics is not just an
opinion that you hold. Another way of putting
that is that ethics and public opinion are
the same thing, some people think that. So they think that as
long as public opinion supports what we want
to do, that it's okay. Well, that's not true. There are many instances where public opinion is not
particularly ethical, and that's really
important to keep in mind. So another American example,
I don't know if you know, but during the civil
rights movement, the idea of civil rights
was very unpopular. So it was not a majority opinion that civil rights
were a good idea, that equal treatment for African-Americans in
America was a good idea. So it's something that changed. So ethics and public opinion
are not the same thing. The second misconception
I want to cover is this idea that ethics
doesn't have right answers. Because of what I said earlier, we're generally
going to assume that ethics does have right answers. It's a little tricky because I don't want you to get the feeling that I have to tell you what's right and you just
copy what I say. Again, it's about reasoning. So I'm not just going
to tell you, "Okay, you want to be a data scientist, do this and don't do
that," and you're done. No, it's not like that. But at the same
time, we do assume that we can reason
toward a right answer. Otherwise, why bother reasoning? We should just skip it. We shouldn't really
be reasoning at all. So we assume that ethics
does have right answers. I mean, professional
philosophers sometimes get pretty constipated
about this one. We're not going to go
there because it's not a professional
philosophy course. But generally, we think that you marshal arguments
about consequences, and that this leads
you to be convincing, and then that's the right answer. So we're not just testing
you on a list of answers. Again, it's about reasoning. So we don't want to
assume that you can have your ethics and I can have
mine and it's all subjective, because that's not really consistent with taking
a class about ethics. Another way of putting that,
that you might hear is some people say ethics
is culturally relative. Now, that's tricky because I totally acknowledge that they are different cultures and
they're different. Yet we don't usually agree
that different cultures, although they might
have different values, they might have
different objectives, they might have different norms, they might have
different assumptions, we don't usually think that because someone comes
from a different culture, there's no way to agree about the right answer
to an ethical situation. We want to respect the
differences in culture, but at the same time, we do believe that
we can reason toward a right answer by in part,
sharing information. So that's what we're
doing in this class. This has already been
covered to some degree. It's the misconception that people are naturally
good at ethics. It's an interesting one because there's a phrase that you often hear these days in artificial intelligence
and in data science, and that phrase is
human-in-the-loop. It means that there's a
system in which some part of the system contains a
human that does something. There are a variety
of versions of it. There's human-in-the-loop, system-in-the-loop,
society-in-the-loop. We're not going to go into that at this particular moment. But I think it's interesting that some people working in data
science ethics, a minority, but some people have
thought that if a computer has to come up with the solution to an
ethical problem, any computer is going to
be worse than any human. So I'll put that in a little more formal
language on a slide. People are always better at ethics than a computer
program would be. I emphasize that because
I think this is silly. This is not as widely
held as some of my other ideas that I'm sharing. But why would it be that the average person
is always better, or any person is always
better than any computer? We can program a computer to make decisions and those
decisions can be true, whereas people can be misinformed and make
decisions that are false. So some systems these days, there's some advocates
for the idea that if a computer's
doing something tricky, that might have
ethical implications, you could just show what they're doing to someone on, for example, Mechanical Turk or another
crowd sourcing platform, and any human making a
judgment about ethics would be better than just
having the machine decide. Now, I think that
that's not true. I think generally,
I'm skeptical of the idea that people are
naturally good at ethics. Because otherwise,
why are we here? Why bother to take this class? The fourth misconception is that ethics is a set of
universal rules. Now again, why should
we take this class? If there were a set
of universal rules, I would just assign them. I would give them to
you in this class and I would say, there they are. If you need to do some ethics, just look up the universal
rules and you'll be done. I think you'll find instead, that ethics is a
case-based inquiry. I slowed down because I really wanted to emphasize
and underline that, it's a case-based inquiry. There are some domains of human activity where we
acknowledge from the outset, universal rules don't work. I heard a lawyer once say, there's no algorithm for justice. That's the assumption of our
court system, for example. The assumption of the
court system is that you might have rules called laws, but when it's time to
apply those rules, there are so many
factors involved and the context is so
important that you need some case-based reasoning to disentangle the
relative importance of all the things
that are going on, and come to some conclusion. So we think of that as a
trial in the court system. Ethics works that way. It's a case-based
inquiry in part, because some of the things that we're trying to weigh
against each other or even trade-off don't have a clear way to assign
numeric values to them. In fact, sometimes just
reasoning through the case exposes a variety of dimensions that could be quite a large
number of dimensions, but also that the
dimensions could be quite difficult to identify without working
through the case. Each case might then have different dimensions and
a different context. That's why applied ethics is
different from philosophy. So you say, this is a class about applied ethics or
professional ethics. One of the things that means is we're going to
have a lot of cases. It's not like here's the universal rules,
then we're done. The last misconception
in this group of the first five misconceptions
is that ethics is timeless. I think I've already said
that because of my examples, but let's just throw
in one more example. That example is the
environmental movement. So the environmental movement
in the United States is a great example of why
ethics isn't timeless. Because in the US,
there was a period before the 1970s when dumping toxic waste or littering or things like this
weren't seen as a problem. So you could litter and it wasn't seen as
really a big deal. I think the reason that things changed was in part, again, my message from the
first misconception about ethics being about
reasoning towards some answer. So in the US, there was a famous book by Rachel Carson called
Silent Spring, and it promoted the idea that
if you dump toxic waste, it will have harmful
consequences, and that the lives of your
children will be worse. Hard as it is for me to really see that that wasn't
something that people knew, they didn't, and they read the book and were convinced
and change their mind. So environmentalism
was really born out of this realization of reasoning through
with consequences. That means that not only is ethics not
just a set of rules, it's also not timeless and that different moments can
have different ethics. But the reason that they
are different isn't that ethics just varies
and it's trendy. One day it's okay and
one day it's not okay, and it just goes up and
down like the stock market. The reason it varies, we hope, is that there's some
available base of information or judgment
for decisions, and that that's what's changed. Is that there's new
information that leads you to understand the consequences of something or the
harms of something. That's what makes
ethics not timeless. So this is a really key point for data science ethics
because we're at this moment of data science when in a lot of the cases
we'll cover in the class, we're not sure what
the ethics will be. There is not a consensus. We're not even sure
what the right way of reasoning about some
of this stuff is. It's a mess, as I said, but it's still a mess
worth diving into, and it's reasoning worth doing. So that's the top
five. I'll stop there.
