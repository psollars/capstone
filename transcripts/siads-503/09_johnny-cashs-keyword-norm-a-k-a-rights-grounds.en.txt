Hi there. Welcome back again. I'm here with our special guest, Johnny Cash, The University
of Michigan therapy dog. I wanted to say earlier, you can follow him on
Instagram if you want to. It's Johnny Cash VI, because he's the
sixth Johnny Cash. That's a standard poodle to be registered with the
American Kennel Club, so they require you
to have that number. Johnny Cash is here
with me and a box for our last segment on a
trick of the trade or a method about data
science ethics. The method for this week
is to think about norms, which are also not
really the same thing, but there's sometimes talked
about in the same way as grounds or rights. So when you're doing
unethical analysis, one of the things that you
might do is you might say, here's something
that seems wrong, but what do you base that on? Like how do you decide this is something
that seems wrong? Some people want to know, I mean is there some list or
something like that? The laws is a list, but
we earlier talked about how the law and ethics
are not the same thing. I don't have all the
answers for you, but I just wanted to
share a trick that I use, and that's that I
find it useful to use in my work because it
often deals with government. I use the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights as a way to brainstorm
about rights. If you're not familiar with it, it's a document produced
in the 50s that just lists rights that there is broad
agreement that everyone has. So it can jog my memory to think about things I wasn't
thinking about before. If you're American, you might know that we have
the Bill of Rights, but the Universal Declaration
is bigger and more expansive and has more rights in it so that it can be helpful. It does have drawbacks. It's was written in the 50s and it's sometimes reads like
it was written in the 50s. So I'll give you some examples. In the Universal Declaration, it talks about things that
you might think are obvious, like the right to
safety in your person. But it also talks
about things like everyone must have an equal right to access government services. It also talks about
freedom from censorship. There must be the freedom
to exchange information. It talks about how you
have a right to hold your own opinion and to
decide opinions for yourself, and you should have
the freedom from arbitrary interference in
you holding your opinion, people trying to
convince you of things. So it has a misinformation
right, or something like that. So there's a lot of rights
in there about work, about freedom from discrimination,
about hate-speech, and so it can be helpful
for me to just figure out where are the grounds that I might argue
this is good or bad? We call this, in philosophy,
we call normative, but we also can
use the word norm, which is not the same word, but in this case I'm being
sloppy with a lot of words. So I'm not saying you should
use the UN declaration, the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights at the United Nations, but you might want to think
about finding something like this that relates to
your work because it's an aide to thinking
when you're asked, well, why should we do this
and why should we do that? It's helpful for me to have an answer that's
bigger than just, it's not fair or it's
the right thing to do. So let's ask Johnny Cash. Johnny Cash are you a fan of using the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights to argue about ethics. So you see I have a box here. Johnny Cash is trained
to sit on boxes, but this is not his box, so he is not used to this box, and this box is too small, so he may or may not want
to sit on it or touch it. So I'm not sure if
this is going to work, and that's how we're going
to ask him the question. We're going to say, "Johnny Cash, do you find it useful to use the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights signed by most of the world's countries at the
United Nations in 1950?" If you do, go ahead
and go up on this box. Up, oh, the suspense. I don't think he's going
to do. I don't think he likes this box, I
think is too small. Up. Can you put your
foot up at least? Just a little bit buddy. No, he's not going to do it. So I think Johnny
Cash is not a fan of normative reasoning using the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. However, he is a fan
of these treats. So, but you don't
have to use that one, Johnny Cash can use
other kinds of lists of normative reasoning's
so that you are groundings that you might
apply in data science. I mean you might want to find one that fits your situation. Oh, he's sniffing the box. I mean, that is a
step forward I think, maybe he should get an
extra treat just for that. I think so. Well, this is
Johnny Cash's last visit, so let's thank Johnny Cash for coming from the University of Michigan therapy dog program. I'm sorry that you can't pet him, but I still think there's some value in looking at cute pictures of dogs and
cats on the Internet. So I hope that it provided
a wellness benefit to you in addition to the four terms that we
covered with Johnny Cash. We talked about patients,
also stakeholders. We talked about harms. We talked about power, or sometimes called whether something is regressive
or progressive, and then this time
we talked about rights or norms or grounds
for how we argue things. Those are the four
most important tips that we decided to emphasize using these special
segments in this course. All though there are many other important
things in the course, we wanted those to
stand out to you, so okay, well, to say
goodbye to the students, I thought I would
bring a special treat. I brought a harmonica. So Johnny Cash has actually
been taught to howl, but I didn't want to
teach him to haul at something that would
trigger him to howl a lot. So I taught him to
howl only when he hears bad harmonica playing. So this is definitely going to be bad because I don't
know how to play the harmonica and
it might or might not work because I
think Johnny Cash, I don't know how he
feels about the howling, but I'm going to give it a
try. Hey buddy, you ready? Front, sit. Howl. That is more like groaning. Okay. Well, the
harmonica didn't work, but I do have a video of Johnny
Cash howling on my phone. So it's cheating, but I think I can play the video and
he might howl at that. Okay buddy. Okay wait. Stay in short with
me. Come on over. Good boy. Okay. Here we go. Get Ready? Good boy. You want
to do another one? That was for you. There he was saying
goodbye to all of you. Thank you for learning about data science ethics
with Johnny Cash. You did a great job. Great job, buddy. I got some treats for you.
