Hello again. I wanted to take a moment and
introduce myself to you in a little more detail
before we move on to the material that's really the meat of week 1 of the course. The reason I wanted to do that is it's a little complicated. I feel like on the one hand, why should you listen to me? I feel like I should
say something about my experience
because I have been thinking about these
issues for a long time and I think that
shapes the way that I structured the course and the decision that
the teaching team and I made of what to include
and what not to include, so I think that's important. I also think that when
people talk about ethics, one of the things that they
sometimes talk about is that your perspective coming in often has a lot to do with
shaping where you come out, and so disclosing that might actually be important from
an ethical perspective to help us think about reasoning in terms of justice or ethics
or things like that. So I'll just give you a
little bio about myself. It's a little embarrassing, but I think I can get through it. So I'm a professor here at
the University of Michigan. I'm in the School of Information. I'm also the director of
a new center that's just launching called The Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing. Now you might notice
that that spells escape, and Escape was a key that was added to the computer
keyboard when people realized you
needed a way to stop the computer from doing something the
operator didn't want. Early keyboards didn't have it. Escape actually used
to be called Alt. But then they decided,
"You know what? Sometimes the computer gets off on something we
don't want it to do, we should add a key
called Escape." So that's the name of our center, but it's also a little bit
the mission of our center, to think about how we might stop a computer system from doing something that we
don't want it to do. I'm a computer programmer, so I come to data science
from computer programming. I first learned to program
on the IBM System/34. I found this picture of the
IBM System/34 on Wikipedia. I learned using a totally terrible programming
language that I can't recommend to you at
all called RPG II. I worked in system integration and then I worked in
software engineering. I was excited to work in Silicon Valley startup
company which was very flashy during the dot-com boom, but then it went bankrupt as things did
during the dot-com boom. We actually were trying
to compete with Google, and it turned out
not a good idea. But don't worry, I
landed all right. Being a Michigan
professor is good too. I worked for a variety of
different organizations, and I think that helps
me think through some of the perspectives we'll
cover in this class. So for example, I worked for the city and county
of San Francisco which is a really large
regional government as regional governments
go, it's pretty big. I also worked for a
multinational conglomerate with $14 billion of revenue, so I did that for awhile. Then I also worked as a
consultant, and as I said, as a startup in a company that was focused
on search engines. Over time, I realized that
I was just as interested in people as I was in computers and data
and things like that. I did really love data, databases was actually my favorite class in
computer science. But over time, I
thought, "You know what? I really want more
to do with people." I ended up getting a PhD in
Communication from Stanford. That was because in that time, the program had to do with
people and computers together, so I thought this will be great, I'll combine these
things together. Since then, I focused quite a bit on the
topics of this class, so I write about ethics,
justice, and technology. My first paper, I
looked it up for you, my first paper about
that topic was in 2001 and since then, I think I've had some impact
relevant to the class. The recommendations that I wrote for public policy relating to computer systems have been cited by the European Commission, by agencies of the
Government of India, the Government of Thailand, I got the chance
to testify before the Parliament of Canada, I've done some
consulting work for the United Kingdom and
the United States. So I'm really involved
in these issues and I'm involved in part because I really
care about them. I think that there's something
here that really matters and that by reasoning
about ethics, we can make a difference
in the world. So I'll end this too long maybe introduction with just
one more example for you, and that's a recent picture
of me standing outside the US Federal Courthouse with my lawyer and co-plaintiffs
in Washington DC. So as a private citizen and not as a
university professor, I've been spending some of my extra time suing
the US government because I believe
that some provisions of the federal hacking
law are unconstitutional. So it's a weird
recreational activity, I never thought I would be suing the government as a hobby. But it turns out to be
very fun and rewarding, and I think we're making some good progress and
have made that already. So this concludes the
introduction that I had for you. Thank you for listening to it. I'm a little embarrassed,
but I think it might bring more clarity to why I'm using the examples
that I use later in the class if you know a little bit about
where I'm coming from. One thing you might notice
is that because I am coming from the tech industry
and I've done a lot of work in social media, although I have worked
in other contexts, a lot of the examples do
come from Silicon Valley, the tech industry,
and social media, though I do have some other
experiences and I used to work in wireless
communication as well, so I have some other
material about that. I'll stop there, and then we'll go on to the meaty
part of week 1.
