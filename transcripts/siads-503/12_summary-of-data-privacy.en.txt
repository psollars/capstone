So does Data Science
hate data privacy. If it's thought of in terms of informed
consent and affecting the quantity of Data Science has access to data then
rightfully so. But I think you have
seen throughout these modules that
privacy in terms of selective disclosure can impact the quality as well as
the diversity of data, especially in regards
to genetic data as we were discussing how
different databases and the different positioning of the company's associated
with those databases then impacts the quality and diversity of the data
that's being collected. Is privacy respecting Data
Science even possible? Well, that's where the privacy
regulations are going. They're moving away from this
informed consent paradigm, to more substantive
approach about restricting data
collected in one context, can it be used in another? But in the meantime, I encourage you to be cognizant of where is your data coming from and where
is your data going, which will be
discussing further in the data providence section
of the course. Thank you.
