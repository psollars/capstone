Hi, welcome to Data
Science Ethics. I am really excited to spend the next month
with you in this course. My name is Melissa
Chalmers and I will be the
instructor this term. I wanted to take a minute
in this video to introduce you to myself and to
the instructional team, as well as give you
some information that I hope will be helpful to you for the next couple of weeks as we work together
through the course. I am a lecturer at UMSI, which means that I
teach full-time in both their residential
and MADS programs. I have a Ph.D. in Information
Studies from UMSI. My dissertation research focused on the invisible work and workers that are
required to build and scale and maintain large-scale technical
systems and infrastructure. As a part of that research, I'm an ethnographer and
I studied that changing relationships between
human workers and increasingly
automated systems. I also have a background in science and technology studies which forms something of a foundation for the concepts in this course and our approach to Data Science Ethics
in this course. Science and technology
studies basically is an interdisciplinary
field that focuses on how society and politics
and culture shapes scientific research
and technology innovation and then vice versa. Together, these things inform my knowledge and my interest in data science ethics because they both focus
attention on the ways that human values
are embedded in and sometimes problematically
reproduced in things like algorithms and
workflows, and products. Over the next few weeks, I will be your guide and your
primary source of support as you navigate
this course along with an instructional team. The first thing that
you'll notice when you start going through
the course is that the video content for the course was originally
developed by Christian Sandvig. Christian is a
distinguished professor at the School of Information, and he's also the
Founding Director of the new Center for
Ethics Society and Computing at the
University of Michigan. I will probably be
posting events and speakers to draw
your attention to some of the really exciting
things that that center does. Christian is not currently involved actively with
the course at all, so you're not really going
to see him in person, but we continue to
work all together as an instructional team
to continue to iterate course content and
keep it current. This is my fourth time
being involved with 503. The first time was
in the first session of 503 back in March of 2020, where I was a
co-instructor along with Christian and
then since then, I've been teaching the
class two times a year. One of my goals for this class is to
convince you that ethics is not just something
that we've added on to the Data Science
curriculum here. We don't expect that ethics is or will be the responsibility of just one person in the
organization that you work for, whether currently
or in the future, and then can be ignored
by everyone else. Instead, in this class, we will present Data
Science Ethics as a series of concepts
that we expect that you might reasonably encounter and have to think through
and need to apply regularly as you go forward in your professional
life as data scientists. The way that we'll do
that in this class is through a combination of readings and
assignments and examples. Then we'll have
plenty of time to engage in dialogue about all of those things on Slack
or in-office hours. On that subject,
speaking of engaging, I want to draw your attention
first to the fact that pretty much all
communication for this course will
take place in Slack. We're going to use the
class Slack channel to post important announcements, to answer questions that are of general interest to
a lot of students, to post articles or current events that are relevant and that we
might want to discuss, and so we're hoping
that you'll use Slack to ask questions, to talk to your classmates
and us about course content, or to bring in
your new examples. One of the great things about MADS is the diversity
of backgrounds and experiences and
professional domains and perspectives that all of
you bring to Data Science. This makes a huge
difference when we can leverage all of
that diversity of perspectives to have
interesting conversations about Data Science Ethics. In this class, like I said, you'll have readings and
assignments and quizzes, which will ask you to apply the concepts that we've
taught you through the lectures and the readings
in different contexts. Office hours are another
place that you will go to engage with us. We've designed office hours
so that they're co-hosted by rotating group of the
instructional team. We'll bring in a lot of real-life examples of data
science ethics in context, and then we'll
also have time for you to ask questions
and that kind of thing. Office hours are a really
great place to interact with your classmates as well as the larger
instructional team, so we really hope
that you'll join us for some of
those discussions. One of the main takeaways that you will leave
this class with is that you will
leave the class with more questions than
you will have answers. That's something that a
lot of students who have taken this class
already have said. We just want you
to know right up front that that's a good thing. That the whole point here is that the critical
questioning, the ethical frameworks,
the concepts, the different perspectives that you're going to be exposed to here will be applicable in your personal and
professional lives, particularly as data
collection practices become more prevalent and
ubiquitous in our lives and they aren't any of them things that
have easy answers. The last piece of
advice that I want to give you as
you're starting out on course content is
to make sure that you understand how you're
being assessed in this class. Short writing assignments
are going to take up 90 percent of your
grade in this class, so you will do yourself
a really big favor if you familiarize yourself with all the resources that are
available to help you. That includes checking out the section on Coursera
labeled resources. It's got the syllabus, which tells you how you can
get help if you need it, it's got a table of
all the examples that we use in the course, it has a document with
writing requirements, it has a document
with the grading rubrics that we will use
to assess your work, and then it has some
exemplary assignments for the first three
writing assignments. We've set that up as a
set of tools for you to use to succeed in the writing assignments
for this course, because as data scientists, not everybody has a background with where they've been
doing a lot of writing. Finally, in this video, I just wanted to introduce you to the rest of the
instructional team as well. One of the things I really like about this
course is that we always have a really
dynamic instructional team. This semester is no
exception to that. These ones we have Merve
Hickok and Dr. Nick Sheltrown, who are both lecturers at SI. Nick in his day job is a
practicing data scientist, whereas Merve is the
founder of AIethicist.org, which is a great website. They both know a lot from their professional
experience that they bring into the teaching
of this course. Then we have four GSIs. Three of them are actually senior math students
who have taken data science ethics and have
graded for it from before, they're Ali, Jamie, and Ruth. Then our fourth GSI is a UMSI
PhD student named Jonathan. You will hear from and interact with all of the
instructional team on Slack, and when you ask
questions or ask for additional feedback and
support, that kind of thing. They'll be part of our office
hours rotating line up. Then they will be
doing a lot of work in the background to grade your assignments and provide constructive feedback
quickly and efficiently. They all have a breadth of data science knowledge
that I learn from every semester
that I work with them, I'm very excited that
you will also have that opportunity
this course session. With that, I will say I can't
wait to engage with some of you on Slack and in office hours in the
next couple weeks, and I look forward
to meeting you.
