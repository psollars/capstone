Now that I've covered the
top five misconceptions about data science ethics, let's get into the next five. I've grouped these together around the heading
"Professional Ethics" because these are misconceptions
that I believe you may encounter when working as a
professional data scientist. I'll start counting from
my last five with number 6 and that's that ethics
is public relations. So in industry, I have some experience in
industry and you'll hear more about industry experiences from some of our guest speakers
later on in the class. In industry, there's sometimes this very porous distinction between ethics and
public relations. If we just do what people want, then we're being ethical
and ethics is satisfied. Now you can see that this
isn't true if you believed my earlier slides about how ethics isn't just public opinion, it's not public relations either. Of course, there
is some relation, like there are many
unethical things that are deeply unpopular. If we started doing
some unethical things, it's quite true that
people wouldn't like it, but there are also
many situations where doing the right
thing is unpopular. So brace yourself for that. Doing the right thing
may also be unpopular and good public relations
might be unethical. So just make it
clear in your mind, public relations is
some different class, it's called data science
public relations, but that's not this class, this class is about ethics. This is a tough moment for the tech industry and
social media particularly. This is an image of protests
against Facebook in the UK. I chose this image
because I really I'm unnerved by the uncanny
weirdness of this. I guess it's a papier-mache,
Mark Zuckerberg head. It's interesting that
the public relations in many cases is advising tech companies where there are ethical concerns
to do a variety of things, but public relations doesn't
really match and over time, any kind of reasoning
about the situation. So for example, there hasn't
been a big public outcry earlier about some of the
things that Facebook was doing. There was this Cambridge
Analytica scandal that we'll reference later in the class that brought a lot
of public attention. But before that,
Facebook was still doing those things and there
just wasn't a lot of outcry. So you can't really
track what people want you to do with
the right thing to do. In this case, there are many instances where in
privacy, for example, there hasn't been
much public outcry about things that I think everyone agrees are pretty awful. Then maybe the outcry really
depends on the new cycle or a particular telegenic case or a particular incident that
sticks in people's minds. So ethics is not
public relations. I'm belaboring the point. You get it? Let's
move on. Number 7. The next one is ethics is
compliance with the law. Now it seems somewhat like I shouldn't have
to say that because it maybe seems obvious but there's a thing when you're
working in industry or a government or a non-profit or wherever and it's
sometimes called compliance or legal affairs or the general counsel's
office or something like that but that is not the
same thing as ethics and we know this maybe from my example earlier about
the Civil Rights Movement, I think we all can say that
there are laws that are unjust in the world
and if we say that, I admit there are
laws that are unjust, it's showing you that ethics is not the same as
compliance with the law. This is a big problem
in data science because people who are unfamiliar with the consequences
of what can go wrong in data science situations
sometimes equate the law and compliance with the law with ethics and so they think if I check the checkbox for compliance as long as we're
not breaking the law, it will all turn out okay
and that is not true. Ask any lawyer, you can do horrible things that are
completely legal and some data science
analysts have done them and we'll see them as
examples later in the class. So yes, I think you should probably be in
compliance with the law. There are very few instances
where you shouldn't be, but that doesn't mean
that you're done. So don't give ethics to the company lawyer or the university general counsel because that's not
where it belongs. I hope that lawyers are ethical, but it's just again, really not the focus
of this course or of Data Science ethics. Number 8. Number 8 is one of my favorites. It's ethics is doing
the right thing at a specific pivotal moment. What do I mean by that? Well, I think before I got interested in data science and ethics and justice and fairness, I think there was a
kind of fantasy that I had that many people
have that there's going to be this moment and you're working
on something and there's just going
to be this crisis of ethics where everyone says, "Oh no, there are two
paths in front of us, what are we going to
do, this or that?" You have to think about like, what's the right thing to do? If I'm a good person, I'm going to take this
path versus that path. That's not really what ethics
looks like in practice. You'll hear that from
our guest speakers, I predict but I also
know it from experience. It's quite common that there is no pivotal moment that
makes you stop and consider the ethics of a situation and you make a lot of incremental
decisions in your life as you go about living it and
working and being a human and they add up to
something but at the time it can be hard to
isolate them and to say, well, this really is where
it took a wrong turn or this is the thing that really made it go the way that was wrong. It's quite likely that your ethical task might
be to make time for reflection where no
time exists or to insert ethics into a conversation where it does not exist. It's also quite likely that we could have things
go terribly wrong ethically and it's really common that an organization
that produces something horrible is composed of individual people who
are all trying the best they can and making
the best decisions that they could with the information they have available to them. So it's all of these individuals doing the right thing as
far as they can tell, will add up to an organization
doing the wrong thing. So don't think about
data science ethics or any ethics as waiting for that moment where
you suddenly think, oh, I'm going to reach
for the ethics book. This is where the ethics applies. It kind of worked
into everything. I'm not saying that there
aren't pivotal moments. There might be, but I
think they're more rare. We may hear about some from our guest speakers but
there are also these just general living your life
where we have to figure out how what we're doing
adds up to something. Number 9, number 9. So number 9 is again
about what it's like to be a data science professional
and think about ethics. Number 9, the misconception is ethics means determining which situations have ethical
implications and by implication, which situations don't
have ethical implications. So it's like, well, this one we're fine, this one
we might have some trouble. This one we're fine, this one
we might have some trouble. It's like you're a
router and you're directing certain problems
into different pathways. That's not really
what ethics is like. One of the reasons is that
I think you'll find if you think about any
situation long enough, there's some ethics there. So there again,
like the last item, they are all mixed
in with everything, ethics is everywhere and woven together with
everyday experience. But in addition, your job as an ethical person is
not really identifying situations that have
ethical implications, although we might want
to think about what's their magnitude or
what are the harms? We'll get into that a little
later but nonetheless, I wouldn't think of it as a yes/no kind of
question like this has ethical implications this
don't because this partly is a way of passing the buck or of intentionally not looking at something where
there are these situations. Number 10 is ethics is someone else's problem
and this really comes up quite a bit in data
science ethics practice. One scenario that you might imagine is that your job is to do a particular thing
in a pipeline or a workflow and you do that thing, you have to trust the other
people in the workflow or in the pipeline or in
the organization that they did what they
were supposed to do. So for example, maybe your job is to perform
a data analysis on some data and it's not your business where
the data came from, it was handed to you and your job was to perform
the data analysis. Similarly, it might be that your job is to collect some data, but it's not really within your purview as to why or
what's going to happen to it? Now, that's a logical way
of thinking and I'm very sympathetic as someone who has
worked and has done tasks. It makes sense to divide things up and to have
a division of labor. But over and over again, we see the situation where
everyone kind of thinks that someone else is going to look
into this and no one does. So there's partly an
organizational role here to be sure that someone's
looking into ethics, but also there needs to be some responsibility
that we have to think a little bit out of our concrete specific
assignments because otherwise, no one's ever going to
think about this stuff. So ethics is not something that you
should just say, "Well, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not in compliance, I'm not in public relations, I'm a math guy, I don't
really deal with people, I don't know what you would say, but I wouldn't say
any of those things because I think ethics
is your problem." I'll give you an example there. This is one of my
favorite misconceptions. So there's an oath that
doctors have to take, they don't actually take
it, I think but anyway, Hippocrates came up with
it a long time ago. This is a butchered version
of it to make it more up to date with the first
lines excerpted for you. But the Hippocratic Oath, it's familiar to most
people and it starts out first, do no harm. The actual oath, it's funny, it doesn't really
start out that way, it starts out with
this statement about how you shouldn't
train anyone to be a doctor because we have to
keep the knowledge of being a doctor in a closed
group just for doctors, presumably so you can
make a lot of money. But that's not the press
of the Hippocratic Oath. The press is that do no harm is the first part of the
Hippocratic Oath. People have proposed
that there should be a data science Oath. The reason I'm making a comparison and that
others make this comparison between medicine
and data science is that they think that
there are a number of situations where it's
really impossible to imagine someone who is
not a data scientist, a lay person, an outsider, making a good ethical judgment about a data science problem. The reason for that
just like in medicine, is that these problems
are technical. So if I said to you, I'm afraid this patient has
somnambulistic rabies and we have to do an appendectomy
with reverse polarization, maybe that's nonsense, it is, but maybe it's also a
technical procedure that only you understand as
a surgeon or a doctor. Data science is like that. A lot of the techniques that
you learn in the classes in this degree are fairly obscure
to the outside person. They don't know about
what you're talking about with all of your eigenvectors and kurtosis and various things and we're not really going to be able to explain
those things to them. So there are a variety of ethical situations that
will come up in which you are the only person that is going to be able to
identify the problem. That's why you can't assume
that data science ethics is someone else's job and
that's what distinguishes this class Data Science Ethics, as Professional Ethics because we need to consider the
problems that might arise with specific techniques in data science because as a
professional community, we are the only ones who are able to make judgments
about these. Yeah, maybe you could
ask the statisticians or the mathematicians or the computer programmers
or someone else, but really, if you're going
to have a profession, the reason it has to make these ethical judgments is
that the buck stops with you. That brings us back to number 10, ethics is someone else's
problem is a misconception because there's really no
one else you can turn to, it's your expertise that
makes you the person who has to consider the ethical
implications of data science. I'll stop this group there.
