Hello, welcome back. I'm here with a special guest. I'm here with Johnny Cash, the therapy dog. Hey Cash, come. Johnny Cash is
visiting us as part of the University of Michigan's
therapy dog program. He is a black standard poodle and he comes to classes in part because it's been found that there are wellness benefits
for students to pet dogs. For Johnny Cash, some
therapy dogs are more into, I guess, being loving. He's pretty loving right now because I have a
treat in my hand, but Johnny Cash is more
interested in tricks, so let me show you
a couple of tricks. Hey Cash, can you do tricks? Sit, his most popular
trick is the fist bump. Good fist bump, very good, but he can do the
standard ones like down, down, lie, lie on
your side, good. Stand, that's good, can
you twirl around for me? Very nice. Can you come front? Sit, can you touch my hand? Good. You touch it
over here, my gosh, what a good dog? Very nice. So I thought that for our
class we might do this, have Johnny Cash
visit once per week, to emphasize a particularly important lesson in the material. So I've got a different studio, a special guest to help you remember that this is a
particularly important lesson. Come on over here, Johnny Cash, so I can pet you.
All right, good boy. Now this week, our
special lesson, which you could think of as a method or a trick of the trade or a concept or a keyword or a tool, this week
it's patients . What I mean by patient, is the dictionary definition, someone who is acted upon. It's the job of ethical
analysis to identify patients, who is acted upon and you sometimes hear
this in your textbook, you hear it referred
to as stakeholders. The reason it's an important
idea is it's not obvious. The pitfall is that
you often forget to identify some patients or
people who are acted upon. I'll give you a data
science example. A few years ago, if
you searched Google or Bing or a search engine
for the search term, ''black girls'' or in fact, any phrase with, ''girls''
as the second word, and the first word as
an identity category, like Asian girls, Latina girls, the results would be porn. The reason for that,
you could say, if you are operating
the search engine is a sound analysis. You could say, ''Well, most of the web pages out there
containing this term are porn, so we're correctly
serving the majority.'' Or you could use the
example of the user, you could say, ''The users, most of the users in this
case are looking for porn, so we're correctly serving
the majority of the users. The search engine has learned, that's what people want.'' However, you could also say, and this is a discussion
that started in the search engine
community a few years ago, you could also say,
''Another reason people use that term is that
they might be girls, so they might be young people interested in their own identity, so that's why they're
searching for black girls, and maybe porn isn't what
we want to show them, even if they're not the
majority in this case.'' Now, I just did an ethical
analysis of a case study, and identified two groups of patients or people
who are acted upon. The first group, was the users of the search
engine that wanted porn, the second group
were the girls who are interested in finding out
about their own identity. I think you might say
I did a good job, but I think there's more to it. Let's ask Johnny Cash. Okay, buddy, sit. I'm going to ask Johnny Cash if I finished my analysis
of the patients. So Johnny Cash,
did I identify all of the patients or
stakeholders or not? I want you to shake
my right-hand, if I identified them all, and my left hand, if I didn't identify them all, and there's a treat in each
hand so this isn't rigged. Ready? Shake. He's
thinking about it, he's not sure, shake. Okay, all right, he went
from my right hand so he thinks that I identified all of the patients in this case. Unfortunately, I did not. So one of the pitfalls is
that you actually are a little too narrow in thinking
about who is acted upon. So you restrict your analysis to the customer or the user, and you don't think that your
system might affect people who aren't using it or directly involved
are paying for it. Safiya Noble, a few years ago, made this great argument
about this case and said, ''Really the issue
of patients here, is that everyone in
society or all girls are affected by this
particular situation because if a search
engine becomes popular, if it scales up as Google has, it ends up teaching
the population that the primary way that
you should think about girls is via pornography.'' So the third group
of patients that I overlooked in this case
would be all girls. You could even
expand that further, you could say, boys, men, women, because the consequences that the search engine is
teaching people that the way that you think
about this group is via pornography and
that could be negative. So there's an example of
an overlooked patient, this was the first segment, of one segment each week, where we're going to talk about a trick of the trade
and this case we did stakeholders or how to identify patients
or stakeholders. Johnny Cash is going to be back when we have
to do our next one. Come on over here, buddy, so you don't show them your butt. Come on over here. Yeah, he's going to be back
for the next one. So I'll see you soon, and Johnny Cash will see you
for this segment next week.
