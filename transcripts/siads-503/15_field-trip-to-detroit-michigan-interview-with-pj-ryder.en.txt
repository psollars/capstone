Hi, welcome back. So we're
continuing our field trip in Detroit and I'm here with PJ, who is a business owner
in the Corktown area. PJ, do you live here in Detroit? I live in Detroit, I
live on the east side. Can you tell us about this
business that we're in? This is PJ's Lager House. It has been open as a bar, even during Prohibition ,from about 1915, it's never closed. I've owned it for about 12 years. There's three previous owners. We are open seven days a week. We do live music, live original music
and food and drink. We're a neighborhood institution. We've been here, it
is never closed. There were times when it
wasn't open that often, but it's never closed. So you're the proprietor of this historic
Detroit institution, the owner, and we're doing a project on
Project Green Light. I understand you're familiar with Project Green Light
so I don't have to introduce it to you. No. Is that right? No. So I know that there's a business
association here in Corktown. Yes. That you guys were made an offer about whether you wanted to
be a Green Light corridor. Can you tell me a
little about that? Well, I think someone
from the city I believe approached us and said, "Look, we'd like to make Michigan Avenue a
Green Light corridor. We need to get four or
five businesses within a smaller area to
do the first pod." It has not extended out
Michigan Avenue yet, but we were the first pod, which was us. Detroit Institute
of Bagels, Brooklyn Local, McShaneâ€™s, and I'm not sure
who the fifth person is, but there's five
different groups. So we agreed to, number one, get the higher up speed Internet which we pretty much all use, Rocket Fiber, and to allow
them to put cameras up, and to record and all
that sort of thing. So can you tell me, what was
the deal with Rocket Fiber? I heard that's from another
business owner as well. Yes, for details and I'm not quite sure I remember them all. I know that they were
involved and they offered us their Fiber Optic
Internet Service, faster internet service. So now, today, we have our
Internet service is Rocket Fiber, our TV is Comcast, and Green Light is a
separate entity from that. I see. It was bundled together, I
believe, that was the deal. Yes, it was originally bundled together, now it is
kind of separated out. I see. But so we are happy with Rocket Fiber as having a higher speed Internet
that works really well, it doesn't go down that often, and it works very very well with the
Green Light's integrated. Well, as a business
owner, can you comment on your experience
with Project Green Light? Yeah. How it has been? For the most part pretty good. I mean, there's the
initial, getting to know each other
stage of dating. They originally
wanted to put cameras inside the bar and I said, "No, that's not going to happen." But in general, they
have been very good. They're responsive.
If people call from here and say
"Something has happened, I'm in a Green Light location", they can look at it much
more quickly and ascertain. My brother was here one time, had never driven a push
button car before, and left his key fob in the
car and got his car stolen. Oh, no. So it took a couple trips
to the police station - this is when it first all just came on - it took a couple days
just to get them to understand, "No, this is a Green
Light location you'll be able to see it." Sure enough, when they finally located it
and saw the film, a local police officer, Officer Dwight said, "I
know who those guys are. We get a warrant for this."
They got a warrant for them. So the thieves know that
we have Green Light. Know that we pay attention to it, and know that if they're familiar to the territory and
they're on film, they're much more likely
to at least get arrested. Maybe they don't go to jail, maybe they don't spend
any time in jail, but at least they know someone's watching and they may
go someplace else. It seems to have helped. That's great. So have you
heard about the controversy? I mean, there's been, since
last summer particularly, complaints about Project Green
Light because I understand initially the city made
a statement that they weren't using automatic
face-recognition. But in the summer, it was revealed that they were using automatic face-recognition. I don't know what they're
using facial recognition wise, but I hate - and I'm old - and
I'm very not fan of it. But the privacy that was once considered
normal no longer is, and you expose yourself everyday. We all got a
phone in our pocket, and that phone is
feeding back a lot of data every single day
that were giving out. Now, if we all want to give up our iPhones and want to give
up our inter-connectivity, well, maybe we'll go
back to more privacy. But I do understand
people's problem whether if it is inaccurate, it causes false arrest
and all that thing. But that never was part of what we were doing
here with Green Light. It was never mentioned,
it was never brought up. Maybe it was done behind the scenes, I couldn't
tell you that. But as far as talking about
what we're doing, no, there is no facial
recognition technology involved in the Green Light here. The main thing that was used to do here was to let people. See, we've had our own
cameras here for years, and the police have come and
used our cameras many times. But now that they've got
their Green Light and even though they don't have
as many as we do, but between the
different locations, now they can actually see a car, figure out what kind of car it is because unless at night you can't even sometimes tell
what kind of car it is, and in which direction it headed. By knowing all of that stuff, they can piece things together, and now with enough of these Green Light cameras they're going to actually trace it, track that someone takes off, and they may find
them as a result. So it has definitely
made a difference. I don't own any of the
parking lots around here, but at night, when we have music, we have a full house, people
do come and occupy the lots. In all honesty, I think the thieves have gone away more so
than the opportunity. The opportunity is still there, but they know that if
they take a shot at this, it's very likely they're
going to be recognized. And if they have any
chance of being recognized by local
police officer, the hassle of getting arrested
is the hassle of getting arrested. Well, so one thing
that I heard from other people when
I was looking into Project Green Light is
that some business owners, even though they support
the project, were frustrated that they felt it was an additional
public safety tax. They wanted the city to provide the service as a part of taxation and not as an extra fee
for $4,000 or $5000. Well, if we really get
into a discussion of taxation in the city of Detroit, yeah, we get into a long
discussion about that. It's one of these things. I lived in Indian Village for 24 years. Indian Village is a very, very nice neighborhoods
But Indian Village does a lot of
that for themselves and always have because
they can because they can create a scene. Like the Indian Village Home and Garden Tour that brings money into
the neighborhood, that money gets spent
to the neighborhood. You have people who
can afford to spend disposable income on something like historic street lights like we did last two years ago. We had our street lights that are getting replaced with
new streetlights. We restored the historic ones
and we still have those up there. We also have to deal with the pain in the neck of being an historic district of having to follow
the rules there. But I've always been used to it as long as I've
been back in Detroit, which is, I'm on my 25th year. If you really want something
done, go ahead and do it. You want to tear down that,
go ahead and tear it down. You want to build something? So I really feel like in
the Green Light situation, yeah, everybody didn't sign on. Those of us here on this little group of
blocks did and I'm glad they did because
I've always been an advocate. But to me, when I first bought this place and I've
got car broken into. I just thought they were crimes of opportunity. I didn't realize these
guys are professionals. They're out regularly,
got the regular patrols, know where they're going go,
know how they're breaking in, know what they're looking for. When I realized that they
weren't just crimes of opportunity, now I go, "Okay. These guys are just going
to prey on all of us until we do something
to try to stop it." I think that the Green Light has made them aware
that they can be seen, and that's the biggest
single thing that a thief wants, to not be seen. Yeah. I'd loved to make it so no
one knows where I was or watch anything I did even away and
putting my computer. Never touched a
smart TV, anything. But that's another era, another day and we're
not going back there. We're just not going back there. Thanks so much. I got it. So the only other
thing I'd ask is, is there anything that
I should ask you or that you want to share about
that I didn't ask you about? No, I think for what
it is used for here, Green Light has been
a really a big plus, and I appreciate it. I appreciate that we have a patrol officer who could really patrol this neighborhood
pretty regularly, and I appreciate that too. Now, of course, I'm speaking of two of the safest
places in Detroit; Corktown is very safe, Indian Village is very safe. The rest, when you get
out behind these areas, you look at the
statistics and you say, "Oh my goodness, there's
all kinds of things going on here." What's going out of
these two areas is less and I think part of
it is lighting in general, vigilance, and then things
like especially using technology to get a step ahead. Car thieves not super
technologically proficient, they're just doing a gig. But if you had a little
more technology you can step out ahead of them maybe, and maybe stop them, or at least it gets them
to refocus on other areas. I hope someday that the
population returns, so this area of town. So Corktown got all this new
development stuff going on. But right now, these are the first new housing
that we've had in this neighborhood in 40 years. So it's been a very stagnant, but now if we fill up
all those apartments, we fill up all
those condominiums, they build some more, well, suddenly we have
more people here, and more people seem to
push out, it's spreading. People move to new neighborhoods, pick-up that house that's dilapidated,
just a little outside of the cool area, and they make it a new cool area. I just think that's going to
continue. I'm a big advocate. In case anybody's interested on Field Street over
on the east side, there's some great houses
on Field Street. You are going to sell some
houses to our students. Okay, I hope so. Thanks again, PJ. You're welcome. Thank you. Very nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in, nice
to meet all of you guys. Thanks for visiting Corktown. Come back anytime.
