Hi, I'm back with an introduction for you for the guest speaker
we're going to hear from next. We're going to talk to JM Porup, a journalist who's covered issues
related to data science since 2002. He's a decorated journalist and
has an impressive resume that we're happy he's able to bring to us and
share his perspectives with you. Now, he's freelance cyber security
reporter covering national security issues but also issues related
to technology in general. His work has appeared in many
venues that you've read, I'm sure. He's published in motherboard,
ARS Technica, Vice, The Economist. He's also the author of
award-winning novels and plays. So he's all around,
a very interesting individual. My understanding is that he started
his work as a journalist and then became more, and
was also interested in and trained in technology and
he worked in software development. He then moved a little bit
toward the technical side, receiving his master's degree from
UC Berkeley and Cybersecurity. He then kind of moved from being
a computer security expert and a computer expert to a journalist,
and then to kind of an important voice in helping the world understand
the impact of technology. We're going to talk
specifically about one article. We're going to start by talking about one
article that he wrote, that's relevant to this class, about the Skynet algorithm and
that you've had in your assigned reading. So without further ado,
let's hear from JM.
