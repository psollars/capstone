Hello there. We're just about at the end of this week, and I wanted to talk a little bit
with you about the assignment. This week's assignment, I hope, is going to be
particularly useful and relevant. Obviously the teaching staff think that
everything in the class is useful and relevant and I didn't put in
anything that I thought was useless. So we tried to put in things that
were only good but at the same time, I recognize that everyone's
coming from a different place and you have a variety of really
interesting backgrounds and experiences that lead you to focus
on a particular topical domain. I do too. There's certainly biases in the things
that I focused on in this class because I wanted you to benefit
from my experience. This week, the assignment asks you to really tie
the things we've covered in this class to your experiences and your needs. So other than - a little different than
the previous week's - the previous week's had a more specific assignment
related to that week whereas this week, what we'd like you to do is reflect
on the course as a whole and to think about the material
that was useful to you. Like, I hope everything was useful and interesting but even within that maybe
there were some hits and some misses, so think about what is particularly
useful to you for this assignment. The way we'd like to structure this
assignment is to think through the genre of the professional oath or
pledge or checklist. We've covered some checklists in the past. You remember, perhaps, our other assignment
about the Canadian checklist for algorithmic impact assessment. What we're going to do in this is a little
different. Instead of asking you to review or comment on for example a software
system like the what if tool or a case study or the Canadian
algorithmic impact assessment, what we'd like you to do is
to come up with your own professional oath pledge or checklist and we'd
like that to be specific to the domain that you're most interested in working
in or that you're likely to work in. So if you're particularly interested in
the auto industry than maybe think about a professional oath, pledge, or checklist
that relates to the auto industry. You don't have to reinvent
the wheel, as I said way back in the introduction
of this class. There's a huge number of checklists and
guidelines and ethical statements out there, way too many I think personally
because we're not really sure which is the right one. But what I think you can do is try to
identify things that we've covered in this class that are particularly relevant
to your situation and think about how you might implement that in a real workplace
as either an oath, pledge, or checklist. This is not an abstract idea. So I'm showing you now a recent magazine
article headline: Should Data Scientists Adhere to a Hippocratic Oath? We talked about Hippocrates and
his oath a little earlier in the class. But generally there is a widespread public
idea that because there are certain dangers specific to data science, and
data scientists are really the only people that are well placed in identifying the
dangers at the time or preventing them by may be doing or not doing certain things
during a data science analysis or during data collection or
during the presentation of data. Maybe there should be some sort of oath
that would give us some guidance and there have been some proposals for that. You can you can also search for
that online. But I just want to emphasize this is
also a fairly normal idea, the oath of Hippocrates and it's the idea
that it starts with do no harm, which isn't actually what it starts with
but most people falsely think that, for doctors is pretty well-known.
But there are oaths for a variety of professions for some time
the Association of Computing Machinery, which I am a member of, which is
a professional association for software developers and
computer scientists. It had a little a little
list of Ethics rules on the back of its membership card so
that you do see a variety of professional organizations that have oaths and
pledges and things like that. I'll highlight one. It's interesting one it kind of fell
out of fashion, but it was proposed by I believe a Nobel Prize
winner in science. And this was a pledge that
was designed for science. It's called the Pugwash Pledge, which I
believe is a reference to a particular conference called the Pugwash Conference,
which I think is a reference to a place. Anyway, the pledge is "I promise to work
for a better world where science and technology are used in
socially responsible ways. I will not use my education for any
purpose intended to harm human beings or the environment. Throughout my career, I'll consider the ethical implications
of my work before I take action." Now, I'm not going to read the rest but the idea behind the pledge
was that science, at the time this was proposed, was
starting to move into areas that people thought were, were
in some ways quite threatening. The particular concerns were about
nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction, some kinds of chemical
agents like nerve gas, weapons of war. And so the idea was maybe we should
have a conversation, as a part of our education process, about what kinds of
things people are expected to do with this education that they're given and
that maybe scientists or technologists could get together and
all agree on what they were about. So this, this pledge fell out of fashion. It's a more of a historical example and
you don't see it as much anymore. But at one time if you
got natural science, or in some cases engineering degree. There would be an organization that
would ask you to sign this pledge. But there's many other pledges.
Checklists are okay too. We, earlier spoke about
the Canadian checklist. But there are a variety of checklists
that are online that you might also, that you might also want to consider.
My message for you is that checklists, pledges, and oaths are actually a pretty
normal part of your professional life. Although we don't tend to think about
the oaths and the pledges so much except right when we're taking them and if we
get into trouble, they're still around. And so what I'd like you to do here is not
reinvent the wheel but try to identify some parts of the course that are relevant
to your particular practice and then it's okay to use existing checklists
or to adapt them to your purposes. So what I'm thinking that you're
doing here is not, maybe, drafting a whole new statement or checklist, but rather stealing, in a productive way,
what's most useful for the career? You'd like to go into and
doing so in a thoughtful way while also keeping in mind that I
think all of these things are partial. So for example, we've talked
earlier in the class about how some of the, some of the things that
you might do as a data scientist that are problematic aren't really done because
you thought you were doing a bad thing. So if we make everyone take an oath that
says, "I promise to be a good person", that's not going to solve
a bunch of ethical problems that really don't relate to whether
you think you're a good person or not. Because we can have bad consequences
even with the best intentions. So, so they're definitely limitations
to all of these mechanisms as ethical mechanisms for for
change or accountability or responsibility in because you know,
I'm not sure if, I mean, I don't think I've taken
the pugwash pledge. But even if I had, I mean I'm going
to still keep doing the best I can to lead an ethical life and
to make science and technology for good but it might turn out that, that
because of the way that the company that I work operates or
something that's out of my control, I've contributed to some ethical problem. And so the pledge might not stop it. So let's think a little bit carefully
about what we're leaving out when we make one of these systems for
applying ethics concretely to a domain or a workplace where you have an interest. All right, and I wanted to stop there. But before I stop I just want to
conclude my remarks by saying. I've been really delighted
to teach this course and I'm really happy to have
had the chance to organize the teaching team's thoughts about data
science ethics and and convey them to you. I tried to go out of my way to make it
a little more interesting than a talking head in a box with Johnny Cash, the dog, and
my buttons and my weird scarves and things and
I'm, I hope you got something out of it. I want you to know that definitely
the teaching team enjoyed producing this for you. So thank you very much and
good luck on this week's assignment.
