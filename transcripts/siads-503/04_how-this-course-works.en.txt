I'd now like to talk to you
about how this course works. I'm going to go through
what we do every week. The first thing I need to say is that, every week we're going
to do the same thing. And that's we're going to talk about what
principles should govern the behavior of data scientists. And we're going to ask the question of how
do we determine whether some action in data science is right or wrong. So that happens every week,
that's the bread and butter of the class. However, I wanted to pause
at the beginning and describe the structure of the course
to you, because I think it might be structured a little differently
than other courses you've taken. Yes, there are lectures, I'm giving you a
lecture right now, we're doing a lecture, it's a lecture, that is probably
something you're more used to. However, in this class because we're so
concerned with practitioners and how practitioners are addressing
the problems that we'll be discussing. We've actually arranged to have
a series of guest speakers. Now these speakers are going to come
in every week, there is at least one, they're going to talk to you
about their own experiences and I'm delighted to have them as
you'll see later in the class. Their bios are extremely
extremely well-suited to give them expertise in this area. There are people who have have long
experience at companies that you'd be familiar with and
in government and in education. So I'm delighted that
they're able to help us, we're really lucky in that they're
coming in just to talk to us. They're either going to have
a conversation in a more informal setting. Or we're going to listen to
a presentation that they crafted just for us just for this class. I also convinced the people here at
Michigan behind the camera to go with me on a field trip. So at one point in the semester, we're going to take a field trip to
a place in Detroit nearby where there is a system deployed that raises a bunch
of data science ethics questions. And we're going to talk to the people
involved in that system and the people affected by it,
so that's a head. As in many classes, we're also
going to have outside readings and some of them will be videos or audio. The thing I wanted to
emphasize about this, is that I didn't design the class so
that the lectures review the readings. So that means that the lectures could
provide material that only exists in the lecture, and
that's why the lectures are important. The readings also could provide material
that only exists in the reading and not in the lecture. I will try to connect to the lectures to
the readings I'll make reference to them, and I'll emphasize particular
points that might be challenging or difficult of interest. However, both the readings and
the lectures are important and sometimes they operate independently. We'll also have a short quiz every week,
I debated about whether we should have a quiz but
I thought personally I lead a busy life. And I need some sort of assessment if
I'm going to be sure that I'm up to date on everything I have to do. The idea of the short quiz is,
to be short and not to be something you worry too
much about, but just to provide some mechanism by which we can be sure everyone
in the class has done the readings. They're on the same page
at the same time and they're ready to complete the assignments,
which I think are the meat of the class. That's item 5 on this slide the writing
assignment, the writing assignments are a little different than other
assignments in some classes. We're going to write using genres
of writing that are things that you might encounter in your
professional life as a data scientist. That means that we're going to write
things that look like memoranda or emails, I guess or reports or assessments. And these are assessments that you would
normally encounter as your practice in data science, it would be something
that would just be a part of your job. We don't have any programming
assignments in this course, we are going to look at one
particular software tool. But in general the focus is really
on writing and reasoning and not about any other kind of assessments. So the short quizzes as I said earlier
are really meant to be not something you worry about too much. We want you to think most carefully
about the writing because, that's really where the reasoning about
ethics that we're doing in this class. Has the chance to affect the world
by affecting perhaps your future co-workers your future supervisors
even your future self. The teaching team of I have organized
the class around framing questions, and the framing questions are set per week,
so I have four sets of framing questions. Now I admit, I made these framing
questions a little provocative and controversial. I'm not telling you what
I think about them, but they're meant to get people
excited about the topic. So the first week we're
considering privacy, and a framing question that you might think
about is, does data science hate privacy? In other words is data science
opposed to privacy in some way? Because you know data scientists, we like
data we want data we want more data. Whereas you might imagine a privacy
advocate wanting the opposite. So our question for that week is, is it possible to have a privacy
respecting data science? Week two we're considering data science
and bias and classification, and the framing questions are,
is data science backward-looking or is it inherently discriminatory. Now that's a big word, but I think I
mean not a big word but it's a word that is loaded to say something is inherently,
inherently, inherently. But because data science is produced from
data and data usually describes the past. Some people have argued that data science
is fundamentally backward-looking or conservative not in
the political sense in the US. But rather in sort of the approach
to making conclusions or predictions or decisions. The third week we'll talk about
governance, accountability and the framing question for that week is. Can large automated systems even
be effectively controlled, and if they're not controlled,
when are you responsible? So we'll delve into issues
of work practice, workflow, how is it that we ensure that
there is accountability for systems when things go wrong, and
then we'll talk about responsibility. So when is it that you
particularly should feel or be responsible for some sort of failure. The fourth week we'll conclude by talking
about data, so we'll particularly focus on data science ethics, and
think about the ethics of data. That week we'll talk about where data
comes from managing data and just really a whole bunch of things that we didn't get
a chance to cover in the earlier weeks. And the framing questions we've chosen
are, is there such a thing as raw data or as some people have argued,
is raw data and oxymoron. We'll also talk about the issue of data
portability, is it really ever a good idea to consider your data as portable, because
that raises a host of ethical challenges.
