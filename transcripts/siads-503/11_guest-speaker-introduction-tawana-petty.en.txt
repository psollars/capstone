I'm so happy that in this part of
the class I'm going to get to take you on a field trip. It's a little unusual for an online class. But I think that we've got some really
amazing things going on in Detroit and I mean amazing both in a good way and
in a bad way. Each of the guest speakers who visited
the class are really perfect fits for their expertise and
I feel lucky we were able to get them. And there's a person like that in Detroit
that we're going to go on location to see. That person is Tawana Petty. I'll just tell you a little about her. She's the Director of
Data Justice Programming for something called
the Detroit Community Technology Project. Now, she's a board member of a number of
organizations including the James and Grace Lee Boggs Center To
Nurture Community Leadership. She's a fellow of
the Detroit Equality Action Lab. Basically for our purposes, she's the leading voice in
opposition to Project Greenlight. She's a social justice organizer. She's a youth advocate. She's a mother. She's an author. She wrote among other books, Towards Humanity Shifting the Culture
of Social Justice Organizing. I think her list of accomplishments
is extremely lengthy. I'll just say a few
more because there's so many I feel like I want
to give you the flavor. She received the Spirit of Detroit Award,
The Woman of Substance Award, The Woman Creating Caring Communities
Award, The University of Michigan. That's us. Black Law Student Association
Justice Honorary Award. She's in Who's Who in Black Detroit? She received the Pacemaker Award
from Wayne State University. She received a certificate of
special congressional recognition from the US Congress. All right,
I know I'm listing too many things but she's an expert on Detroit's Project
Greenlight and a very engaging speaker. So we're going to travel out to Detroit to
talk to her and that's our next segment. After that, we're also going to get
the chance to speak to two other people. We're going to talk to an owner
of a bar in Corktown and a cashier at the Detroit Institute
of bagels and they're going to react a little bit
to the things that Tawana's saying. So that's the structure. We're going to start with
the expert on Project Greenlight. And then we're going to pull back to
more brief reactions about people who from people who experienced the system
in their everyday working lives.
