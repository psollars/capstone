Hi, my name is Amanda and I will be teaching you the data privacy
part of the data science ethics module. And I'm hoping to convince you of
two questions, does data science hate privacy and is privacy-respecting
data science even possible? So if you think about data privacy
in terms of informed consent, checking the box for
your terms and conditions, absolutely, data privacy limits data
scientists access to the quantity of data. However, if you think about data privacy
in terms of selective disclosure, and if someone doesn't want to share
something due to the sensitive nature, for example of that data exchange, then it actually does impact the quality
of data that a data scientist has access to and we'll come back to these
questions throughout this module. But hopefully I can convince
you that actually data privacy is important to data scientists
in the sense of quality. And then, is privacy-respecting
data science even possible? So right now, as we'll learn, privacy protections are really
based off of informed consent. However, there are a lot of limits to
the success of that paradigm in the era of big data that you are working in and so
how do we prepare for privacy regulation. That is going to take a more
substantive approach and thinking about if data is
collected in one context, is it appropriate to be used in another? And as those regulations
are coming down the pipeline, tt's important to think as you yourselves are
data scientists practitioners thinking about where your data is coming
from and where your data is going. And so, over this part of the course we'll
be reviewing conceptions of privacy. Thinking of privacy in terms
of not only the individual but also the social and collective. We'll consider privacy principles and
the regulations that they inform. Also discuss informed consent and
the limits to privacy decision-making. As well as the limits to the
de-identification and the implications for group privacy. And then the summary will
return to those two questions. And hopefully convince you that
data privacy isn't the archenemy of data scientists.
