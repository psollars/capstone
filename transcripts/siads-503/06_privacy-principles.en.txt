All right, so in my
effort to convince you of data privacyâ€™s importance
to data scientists, let's review data
privacy principles that inform the regulations that you will need
to comply with. So in the 1970's, produced the fair information
practice principles also known as FIPS, an acronym to keep in mind, and the main characteristics
were transparency, use limitation, access
and correction, data quality and security. These are the characteristics that have informed our current individualistic as well as reliance on informed
consent that we see. So transparency for example, motivates those long notices
that then you consent to, use limitation so in
those notices can outline where and how
this data will be used. Unfortunately it's usually
pretty open-ended so we'll get back to
use limitation. Going forward, access and
ability to "correct" the data which is seen in efforts to be able to correct for example your credit report, data quality and data security, which are of course
still relevant today. The 1970's also saw the publication of
the Belmont Report, which has much more broader
application outside of data privacy and was
actually motivated by basically ethical issues
in human subject research. So the Belmont
Report was published to basically lay ground rules of what is appropriate in
human subjects research. So one, respect: focusing
on that humans, each individual human,
is an autonomous agent and should be respected
to be able to make their own decision. Beneficence: doing more good and minimizing the
harm as well as justice: is so being
able to, for example, in research share the findings
of research communities. So out of the Belmont Report, if you do any human
subjects research, especially in academia
or medical setting, you will interact or
hear about the IRB, the Institutional Review
Board, that reviews research projects to make sure
that they are appropriate. As well as the common rule, which again sets
privacy protections for the human subjects research. So understanding these
various principles informed the laws that you
will need to be aware of. So in the US, we take a very sector-specific
approach to data privacy, including HIPAA covers data privacy in a medical setting, specifically covered entities is the term where there's
protection as long as data is collected
in what you would consider a traditional
healthcare setting. So with your primary
care provider, or an error in an
emergency room, etc. and how that data is then given to insurance
companies, for example. However HIPAA does
not, for example, cover data from, I'm not wearing one because I study data privacy but, if you had a Fitbit or
a wearable or are tracking what you're eating in an app, a health app, then that data's not
protected by HIPAA. FERPA is another US, sector specific privacy
law focused on education. So for example, once
you've turned 18, the student has to
give permission. So for example, their parents
can see their grades. So this is in contrast
to Europe and you've most likely heard of GDPR, the General Data Protection
Regulation that has a lot of broad-based, and it's not sector-specific,
privacy regulations. The most notable
is the Right to be Forgotten, and since this
GDPR was implemented, similar very
broad-based regulations have been implemented in Brazil, Japan and most
most notably California. So while a state in the US, it's been really important in the development of
privacy regulations. Specifically I believe
it was back in the 90's, a privacy regulation from California state basically
as the reason why they are privacy policies on every website on the internet and that's because since the internet
is such a global phenomenon, companies don't necessarily,
can't control where a visitor to their website is visiting from based
off of their state. So the company is just basically, the California law becomes a floor that they
adhere to as well. This is true in GDPR, even if you're not European and just to
conform, many companies have adopted GDPR as
their baseline of privacy protections
for other users. So even Americans have benefited from GDPR even
though it's a European law. So given these privacy principles
that we have discussed, stemming from the 1970's, thinking about principals
for the big data era. These are from Fred Cate, another
legal privacy scholar. So thinking about
collection limitation, which is different from use limitation previously
seen in the FIPS that we discussed a few
minutes ago. Data quality, that's same. Purpose
specification: so in the era of big data, data is the new oil and
basically companies are just trying to collect as much data as possible - and it'll be useful
sometime down the line- So one of the
important steps is to have companies especially state, what is the purpose of
their data collection. Use limitation,
security safeguards, openness, participation,
as well as accountability. I think accountability is really important because in contrast to the FIPS principals that
were created in the 1970's, those very individualistic
and really informs our consent paradigm. But thinking about how these data collectors and users of our data can
be held accountable. So given these various privacy principles
stemming from the 1970's as well as suggestions
for the big data era, it becomes very apparent that there are inconsistencies
across time and space and so given the - my favorite information
type of genetics - thinking about how FIPS really motivates our reliance
on informed consent. The Belmont Report
only really protects against privacy harms in terms of human subjects research. So mainly thinking about genetic data that is collected
in a research context, for example, verses a 23 and me
direct to consumer example. Then you have HIPAA. So protecting genetic
data that is collected in a medical setting
with your doctor or with a genetic counselor, but not, again, in a
direct-to-consumer setting. Then you also have GINA, which was only created in 2008, which protects against
the use of genetic data in employment and health
insurance decisions. However, the main protection it left out is with
life insurance. So people are seeing their life
insurance policies being voided because of new findings regarding their genetic profiles, which changes the amount of life insurance
that they are due, as well as GDPR which is that broad-based European
privacy law that, because of the global span of the Internet, it
impacts Americans, as well as the CCPA, which is California's GDPR, which you've probably seen gotten flurries of updated privacy policy
notices in your email. So as these privacy principles
and regulations evolve, it's important to keep in mind the latest, and understanding also the roots of
these regulations.
