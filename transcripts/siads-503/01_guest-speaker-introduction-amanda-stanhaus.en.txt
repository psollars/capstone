Hello again. Now
it's time for me to introduce a guest speaker
to you, Amanda Stanhaus. In this class, we've tried to
choose guest speakers that have really unimpeachable
credentials. They really have a perspective
that compliments mine, so they've done things
that I haven't done, but also I think we've got a
really great group that has their fingers on the
pulse of the debates that are going on right now
in data science ethics. So I'm really delighted to
introduce Amanda to you. She's quite distinguished. So her focus on data
science and privacy, is the culmination of 10 years of experience in the
domain of health. Her specialization
in health policy started out when she was an undergraduate student
at McGill University. She then went on to
study bioethics, and she investigated the
ethical consequences of blockchain based
health record systems, which is a very trendy area,
blockchain-based, anything. She then worked in
the financial sector. She's been at the forefront of the industrial
adoption of what are called privacy
preserving technologies. She worked at JP Morgan as a strategist on
the blockchain team, and when she was doing that, she was a part of the company's open source
release of Quorum, which was a privacy preserving
version of Ethereum, if you're familiar
with that software. She's currently a fellow
in the ethical, legal, and societal implications of genetics funded by the US
National Institute of Health, and she's also a
PhD student here at the University of Michigan in the School of Public Health. Her focus right now is researching the
appropriate secondary uses of genetic data, and given her industrial
and research experience, I can really think of no
better person to talk to us about data
science and privacy.
