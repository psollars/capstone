Hi there. I'm here to give you a brief introduction
to our guest speaker. We're going to hear shortly from Kathy Pham and I can't tell you how delighted I am that Kathy
agreed to visit our course. Kathy is a data scientist and software engineer
with such a breadth of experience that I think that she really
is going to bring some interesting
observations that span very different domains. So for example, Kathy
has worked at Google, Kathy has worked at IBM, but Kathy was also one of the pioneering members
of something called the US digital service in the US government under
the Obama administration. So she has an industry background and a government background, and I think that might give
her some interesting sort of basis from which to make observations about data
science and ethics. I have her CV here and
it's really impressive. So I don't think I'm going to
be able to read everything, but you can look her up
online if you want to. But she currently
heads something called the Ethical Tech
Collective at Harvard, she also has an
appointment there at the Shorenstein Center and at the Berkman Center for
Internet and Society. She's a fellow of the
Omidyar Network were she lead something called "the Responsible Computer
Science Challenge". Her work has been
in Wired magazine, Fast Company, TechCrunch,
VentureBeat, NPR. She has a master's degree in computer science
from Georgia Tech. She's really just
an amazing person I noticed in her [inaudible] , I don't know if she
wants me to share this, but she was a finalist in the StarCraft II After
Hours Gaming League. Anyway, very, very interesting
and distinguished person with a long record of industry
and government experience. I'm hoping that will give
us some insight into the profession in a
way that I couldn't provide if it was just me
talking to you on my own. So here's our
conversation with Kathy.
