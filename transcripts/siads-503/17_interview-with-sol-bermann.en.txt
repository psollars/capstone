Hello and welcome back. I'm here with Saul Berman a very
distinguished guest that I'm very excited to have join our class. The reason I asked Saul to join our
class is that he's an expert in higher education and big data and data science. Today, we're going to talk about I
believe learning analytics, although the conversation may stray a little bit to
other topics relevant to higher education. Saul, thank you so much for joining me. >> My pleasure. So to say I'm an expert
in learning analytics, I'm an expert in a piece of it or perhaps
an expert, it's still an emerging field. But at the University of Michigan were
one of the world's leaders in learning analytics, which is really nothing but
big data and data science around students, around learners. >> Could you tell us your title? >> Sure, so I'm
the Chief Information Security Officer for the University of Michigan, but
I also do a lot of work in privacy and ethical spaces, and
in particular around learning analytics. So learning analytics at the University
of Michigan is a big deal. We do a lot of the research that is
leading the way the world does it but learning analytics as
with other big data and data science is more than just about
the algorithms and the outcomes. So as learning analytics work started
at the University of Michigan early on privacy and ethical considerations
were identified as something that we need to figure out how to do, how do we build it into a place
where we do a lot of research. >> Could I ask you then for the students
watching, what would be an example of learning analytics in case
they're unfamiliar with the term? Like what kind of analytics
are they experiencing right now? >> Well, gee, so
if our online learners are using Canvas or any other sort of learning management
system that learning management system is tracking them and
in their engagement in the class. And that's no different if you're online
or if you're a residential student. So honing in on just the the learning
management system, you obviously you log into it, you get your
assignments in it, you get grades in it. You may have message boards where
you're providing feedback or doing online engagement almost like a
bulletin board or social media experience. Behind the scenes all that stuff
is being collected and tracked. So we can tell in certain
learning management systems, when did you go into that assignment? Was it at five in the afternoon? Was it at midnight? How long were you in the assignment? It might end and faculty members
often have access to this data. So you may know if a learner has been
in a 300 page reading assignment for 10 minutes or for 10 hours. >> In fact at my previous institution,
although not here in Michigan. They had it set up so that the system
would give you an estimate about how much of any particular reading
student had accomplished. And I'm here at Michigan,
correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure at some point I logged
into Canvas as an instructor and it showed me a star rating for each
student, which was called the Engagement. So it said that this student
was a three star student and the student was a two-star student
that there was no other explanation. So I actually shared that with
the students of the class and they were very unhappy, they didn't like the idea that they were
a one star student and they didn't know. But I should say,
I haven't looked into that on Coursera. >> Yeah, but that is the sort of
some of the student experience, sort of on the flip side of this big data,
data science world where the subjects. Speaking more broadly in learning
analytics almost any data point about a student can be become part of
a learning analytics experience. So if you're a residential
learner you swipe in and out of buildings with an ID card,
that gets recorded somewhere, that maybe be good fodder for
learning analytics. Your engagement in student organizations, when you log into your to various
accounts, if you're using the WiFi and there's authentication data that actually
provides your physical location. All those can be used in the learning
analytics context, which is why ethical considerations are so important
in how we actually form these systems. >> But I understand that right now
universities are making decisions about how much they want to
Invest in these systems. I mean, can you tell us more about this
location tracking that is being offered to universities right now? >> So
this is less an offering of a system, and just a byproduct of actually how
our WiFi works at any institutions. >> I see.
>> So as you authenticate into WiFi, I'm looking around a studio of course,
but there's access points, access points collect information to allow
you to use your whether it's your phone or your laptop to get on WiFi. That provide that access point also has
a physical location and because we have such dense WiFi at the University of
Michigan that gets fairly granular. So there have been researchers here at
the University and certainly elsewhere but I know at the University that have
wanted access to this information. Because they want to understand learners,
they want to understand for instance if I know that you are accessing
a WiFi and you are with five other people. What can we tell about these people
that might say when this group of people congregate, they get
synergistic learning opportunities. When these people congregate,
maybe they drive each other down somehow. But that's feels awful big brother-ish. >> So we can get a location as granular as a room-
>> Yeah >> Just using WiFi? >> Yeah, so when this came up and
again, and I feel researcher here, Michigan brought this to us
wanting to use the data and we said no that we'd only do
it under certain conditions. And condition number one is that it goes
through the appropriate institutional review board process. So like any other social science
experiment using human subjects and our students. I can go on a tangent about how they
fall through the cracks in from a legal perspective often in this space. But you have to go through this
process where that your research study is reviewed and
approved by a group of peer reviewers. And then even after that we said no, we're not going to give it to you
unless you actually consent to it. And so that was part of the IRB and we weren't just going to turn over
access to this data to the researcher. We actually created an app, so the student
can download the data about themselves. If they agreed to be part
of the research study, they can turn it into the researcher. So it's example as this is sort of my pet
phrase that I've built in the spaces. We are trying to build privacy and
ethical considerations into the fabric and framework of how we do learning analytics,
so that the algorithm is not the only outcome we're looking at, it's not
just the end justifying the means. >> I mean, it seems like you put a lot of
careful consideration into the rights of students when you made that decision. But I understand that there may be other
institutions that pursued a different strategies, is that true? >> Mileage varies depending
on the institutions. So it varies as widely as some
institutions don't really engage in much learning analytics at all because they are
very concerned about student perceptions, about student privacy. Some institutions it is
part of what they do, and if you're out in their campus,
then that's their thing. And they may or may not be transparent
about it, they may or may not give you agency but your only choice if you don't
want to participate is to not go there. >> And that's really significant just to
be sure the people, Listen and understand, if I understand, if you're a residential
student, it means that the university has the ability to track you as you move
from room to room in your own house, potentially, as well as in pretty much
every possible part of your life. Because you'll be eating on campus,
maybe at the dorms, or at the restaurants. You'll be going to school,
using the sports facilities, the gym, so they could have almost universal coverage
of your life at a very granular level. >> Yeah, and you can layer on top of that,
when you think about a residential university,
we are your school, your library, your healthcare facility,
your gym, your social media center. We're about every facet of your life,
and for legitimate reasons, we collect data to provide goods and services that
are an important part of that experience. But in the world of big data and
data science, in this case, learning analytics, all those data points
can become of value to a researcher, and I am a believer in the potential
of learning analytics. It is not just about Big Brother,
it is about better outcomes, better interventions,
better student learning and teaching experiences, but
we have to be cognizant of the flip side. How are we not being Big Brother? How are we not training our students and
future leaders of tomorrow to just accept a surveillance society,
or that algorithms and artificial intelligence will
make decisions for you? >> Well, let's think about the good side,
since you say you're an optimist, that would be good. So if I understand how many of
these systems are deployed in places where they're using learning
analytics, a common strategy would be to take your data about students,
and try to classify them into groups. For example, commuting students, or
residential students, something like that. And then, you would look at deviations
from the norms within the group, and flag that for some purpose, and
some of the purposes can be quite noble. Do you have examples? >> On the optimistic side, and I try
to be optimistic, it's hard sometimes. But on the optimistic side, in particular,
I'll think about the Michigan experience. If there are groups that are perhaps
underrepresented in certain ways, that maybe they come from lower incomes, where we want to better track progress,
and see what differentiates a successful lower income student from
a successful lower income student. And looking for those deviations, and
from those, perhaps taking action. Maybe it's mentoring, or
it could be, It could be nudges, or other interventions that can help
spur a student on to better successes. >> So you could see a pattern that might
include something like not logging into any online system, or not leaving
their room, or something like that. >> Never visiting their advisor. >> Okay, yeah. >> On the other hand,
I guess this will be the pessimistic side speaking, I worry in a few ways. So one, whether we believe it or
not, at 18, you're an adult, and
you get to make decisions. And in a world of big data and
data science, the information we get may lead us to want to nudge
students in a certain way. So I'll pick on myself. When I was a college student,
I was an atrocious math and science student, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, and I didn't challenge
myself very hard in those spaces. But what if I had wanted to? What if I, you know what, I'm going to
take that advanced chemistry course, even if I'm just going to scrape by. Back in the prelearning analytics days,
maybe I'd have an advisor that'd say, Saul, it's not a good idea, or
Saul, you sure you want to do that? In a learning analytics world,
where we have, again, algorithms and machine learning parsing
through what's successful and what's not,
with automated ways to send nudges. Saul, are you sure you want to do that? Saul are you sure you want to do that? Or Saul, maybe the positive, Saul,
go this way, Saul, go this way. Are we actually, potentially,
stripping students of choice? Are we stripping students of learning
opportunities, even through failure, or through challenges? Isn't that part of the whole point
of going to college or university? To be challenged, to challenge yourself. >> Well, it sounds to me like
the story you're telling is one where people are pushed toward normalcy,
or averages. >> That is one of my worried outcomes. Are we creating a happy medium of success? Or are we creating conformity? And again, that's that's not what
higher ed's supposed to be about, at least in my opinion. >> You also mentioned that you had some
concerns about whether the systems would work, so that's interesting. In some of the news
coverage of these systems, there was one particular story I remember,
where the professors had decided to use a Bluetooth tracking system to do even
more granular perhaps location tracking. And that professor had decided
to use that to track attendance. And students are,
maybe the students watching now, are very interested in points,
and tracking their points. And so, this actually produced
an incentive to use the system. But also, sometimes the system wouldn't
work, and so the students spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to be
tracked by the attendance tracking system, which didn't seem to detect
them in the right place. >> Yeah, so I think we're going to see,
maybe not a rebellion against some of these systems, but some of the tools
perhaps, where students will, they're smart,
they will learn to game the system. So I'll give you a different story. There is a university
in the United States, where actually physical exercise is
a mandatory part of the curriculum. And they decided that, you know what, it's not good enough to have an honor code
to say, I took my 10,000 steps today. All students had to get a Fitbit or
some sort of pedometer like device, that was going to send information back
to a central repository to say, yes, Saul got his 10,000 steps. >> Wow, really? >> And so,
students pretty quickly figured out, well, I can just put it on my dog,
or I could put it on a friend. And now, maybe that would violate
some sense of honor code, but there's always a sort of way the mouse
is going to beat the mousetrap. But again, the cynical part of me says,
to what end? While I appreciate the positive aspects,
and that this can help students be more successful, help universities
learn how to better serve students, I also worry about how
engaged students even are, in understanding that
the activity's taking place. And I can say in most places, they're not. And this, too,
brings greater ethical concerns about, are we basically building
students that take it for granted that these things will
take place behind the scenes, and that there is a beneficent wizard
behind the curtain all the time. When we see how some of big data and
data science issues play out, whether it's in the government or in
the business sector, that's not the case. >> Sometimes students complain
about these systems by saying that they're the customer. So they use a metaphor business,
although higher education, I'd like to think, isn't a business,
it's an important part of society. But they say, well, we're the customer, we're
the ones who should be deciding things. But there's a famous quote by Mario Savio
from the 60s, and he said something like, you think that you're the customer, but In the system of higher
education you're the products. And the factory is the higher
education system producing you. And so what I hear reminded me of that
quote because it sounds like you're saying in some ways we're conditioning the next
generation to expect a certain level of nudging and prediction and surveillance
and a certain sort of kind of life. >> Well, and
I think going back to that quote, outside these ivory walls that
are higher education, as a citizen, as a consumer,
you are the product. When we think about what Google or Amazon
does with data, they commoditize you. And I don't necessarily want to
train our students that that's okay. At minimum, one of the things higher ed is supposed to be good at is
training students to question. And if we are actually complicit in
making them the product, we may also be taking away that sort of questioning
nature because it's all taken for granted. They did it to me when I was in college. Why should I care? I'm getting this great personalized
products from Amazon just like I got my great personalized education. >> Well, one of the things that I think
we could really benefit from is your years of experience as a professional
working on these topics. So when you encounter some sort of
question about, perhaps a new technology or in this case, you described a request
from a faculty member about Big Data. Can you tell us anything
about your process or what that looks like
inside your organization? >> So we'll pick on, again,
my experience is learning analytics here. When these requests started to come in,
I go through a fairly typical process, which is I reach out to
the appropriate stakeholders. In this case I reach out to folks in
our office of academic innovation, in our registrar's office. And he thought this feels odd,
this feels a little uncomfortable. What can we do to create a framework where
faculty can go about the research and learning analytics that
they feel is important, and that we can put
appropriate safeguards or guardrails so
that faculty aren't going willy-nilly. And I hate this, I guess I will backpedal
to say I have not met a faculty member at the University of Michigan and other
places in learning analytics that has anything but
the best intentions at their heart. But part of my job is to not just assume
everybody is the best of intentions and know that accidents happen. So our first step in how we address
things we came together and we actually created a set of
guiding principles around ethical use of learning analytics data,
and we made it a two-way street. There's a component that we had our
expectation of researchers, but also expectations of students. That they would be participants, but they would learn to question
along the way, for example. It's not enough to have words on paper. So we've done a number of
other things than Michigan. We have actually tried to build some of
these guiding principles into some of the teaching tools that
we use at the University. More importantly to me though, is we've
actually tried to engage students. So in a lot of the learning analytics
space you hear about the wonders of the algorithms,
the wonders of the research, but you don't hear about how does
students actually feel about it? So there are faculty members at
the School of Information at the University of Michigan that
are looking into attitudes and perceptions around students and
learning analytics. And to my knowledge, that's one of the first research
studies being done in this space. So if we have an understanding of their
perceptions, their value propositions, where they feel it's going into
creepy land, it can help us better build tools and again, better make
them not complicit as products. >> I have to say I'm not one of those
faculty members that's studying this. But I mean, are there any results,
even anecdotal results that tell us what kind of reaction the students have
had to these kinds of technologies? >> The early results I've
heard from the research, and then I'll talk about some my
own anecdotal experience. From the research, my understanding and
shameless part for the School of Information for you and
job Chris Brooks, early results from the research says the students
appreciate what the tools do for them. They didn't understand how much data is
being collected by some of the tools and they want to know more. So some of the anecdotal conversations
I've had with other students, and I'll pick on our learning
management system, as they didn't have a thorough understanding of just how
much data is collected in that system. That it wasn't just, professor knows
I turned my assignment and check. But professor knows that I was a one,
two or three star, right? And jeez, how what is one two or
three star even mean? >> Yes. >> And that was a little more
concerning because there they felt they were being judged or even graded on things they didn't have
an understanding of how it got there. It's one thing to say, yep, I turned in my
paper and obviously here's a work product. And it's another thing to say,
well, I participated in class. I raised my hand, or
maybe it was in a bulletin board or some sort of chat conversation. Yep, there's a visible artifact. It's a different thing to say, a faculty member sees I'm a one star because maybe I didn't spend time reading that assignment
to insert level that a three-star did. >> Maybe because I already read it. And so I didn't need to click
on it this time, right? Right, or maybe I checked
the book out of the library. >> Right. >> And didn't read it online. >> Moving beyond learning analytics
slightly, I mean, I'm very impressed by the degree to which the University
has a lot of data science going on. And its operations, and
not just its research, but in, sort of, making the University work. I mean, one of the things I find
interesting about this context that I bet you know a lot about,
is that, in some situations, students actually have more rights than
people in other contexts because of, for example, in the US the federal
laws protecting student privacy. So there have been a number of cases
where universities have stumbled it. Well, they've run across that law in their
efforts to provide services to students using new technology. And I'm thinking particularly
Michigan is a Google campus. So Google is one of our vendors, and when
I use my University of Michigan email, it's a Google Gmail system, right? So an early, on even though Gmail is
an advertising supported service, the product they offered to
universities didn't show ads, but they were collecting data from email. And so over time this came out. It wasn't widely known at first, but
after it came out, there was an outcry and then they backed off of that. But it seems like there are many
instances in the operation of the University where there is
actually some data science going on. That has the potential for you know,
either privacy risk a security risk or some sort of ethical risk,
is that the right sense? >> We are all big data
science driven organizations. No matter universities,
corporations, governments. So yeah, they do exist. We wanted to use better data science to
understand how our public transportation, the University bus services used. We want to use Big Data and
data science to understand wayfaring. How do people make their way around
buildings across the University? We want to use it to make sure our
faculty and staff stay healthy. So we have health and
wellness programs that rely, not just a little bit, but probably
a lot on Big Data and data science. And from those couldn't how can we
incentivize better health behaviors For our faculty and staff. >> It's sort of like, I guess what I imagine a company town
would be in the old days of coal mining. Sort of you buy things
at the company store. You've got the company doctor. You live in the company
house in many circumstances. Yeah. >> Yeah, hopefully we won't
start issuing M script but yes, especially for our students. I mean, I would say that especially
applies to students because they do live in the company town and they're M script. It can be on their M card where we know
what they're spending and not spending. I mean so far one of the pictures that
comes out of the conversation for me is that the University of Michigan
actually sounds pretty great. Like if I were a student I would think
like well this guy seems pretty thoughtful and you know, he seems to be
looking out for me and I liked it. I wonder to what degree though, following up on your suggestion that
we question, to what degree should we feel secure in the University's
motives to protect the students? Because I asked that just because I was
reading about University use of data science and some of the uses seemed
like they would be great examples for this class. Because they do pose ethical
challenges for the data scientist. So admissions was an area that that I've
read about that definitely seems like one of those. So for example, I don't know
University of Michigan what they do. And I know you're not in
the admissions office. But I know that other universities,
they're really watching their rankings like their US News and
World Report and other rankings. And they know that it's a huge benefit
to them if their ranking goes up even by a little. And so they do things like commission
data science consultants to go through data of prospective college students and
find those college students that they can entice to apply that haven't currently
applied so that they can be rejected. And the idea is that if they can get
enough people they won't admit to apply it will make them their selectivity
rate go up which is a big component of that US News. And I don't know if Michigan's doing this, but I do know that American
universities do things like this. I mean they also do a variety of data
science projects in admissions that balance student load where they try to
be sure they admit enough people that are wealthy so that they can cross
subsidize the students without money. And this often leads to sometimes perverse
individual decisions where you might say, I look at this person who got in this
person who didn't get in doesn't make any sense based on their merit,
based on their ability. But it had to do with this balancing. So I mean, how do you feel about
the university as an organization. I mean what's your level of skepticism? So I am always skeptical. I think I'm a little less skeptical
about Michigan for a few reasons one. We have the luxury of being
a premier institution where most of our most of our schools and
programs are already top rated and it's about maintaining if not,
excellent or great, awfully awfully good,
I think because we are also such a decentralized body
that at we often we aren't even an Amazon or
Google in the way we operate. I think the other part is that I can
say with fairly straight face that our administration actually cares about things
like privacy and ethical use of data. I don't know about the admission
practices in our offices. But the skeptical part of me says
at some point there's always a risk of somebody else is doing it. So should we do it? And part of my role is to try to be a part
of the be well ingratiated enough at the University that be able to
identify if that's going to happen, to be a part of the conversation. And it's also to do things that
what I would say is go above and beyond expectations particularly for
students. So, you know, I mentioned in the learning
analytics space how we're trying to do research into students' perceptions and
attitudes around learning analytics. Another thing we are slowly working on is
trying to be create some sort of portal or dashboard function that gives more
transparency into the data we collect about students and how much use. Mm-hm and it's pretty nascent
early sign of a debate. I would say an alpha stage but we're one
of the only universities in the country that has spent any time or effort in
putting something like that together. So if you think about
the Google dashboard, it's actually a pretty cool tool. We are trying to create I can't say it
will be as robust and powerful, but a very vaguely analogous Michigan
dashboard for my students. I mean, I do notice that in some
of the projects you're describing, there's a really interesting role for
design. I mean earlier you mentioned the way
that you got consent from students to participate in the research project
involving location data was that you showed them the data they
would be releasing first. And then you asked if
they wanted to share it. I mean that's a step that is beyond I
think what most people would expect from a consent process. because usually you just
say do you consent and there's maybe a lot of small print right? >> Yeah.
>> So I mean what prompted in your organization this focus on design or
making as a sort of strategy? >> Some of it was probably accidental. Some of it was was forced by the IRB,
the Institutional Review Board process. So they said this data
clearly has to be consent. It was up to us to figure out what
the mechanism is and how it would work. So consent is you say yes in whatever form you provided the faculty member. And then we just provide the information
directly to the faculty member themselves. Right, we thought that wasn't good enough. It was such powerful data that we wanted
students to have an opportunity to understand it at least a little
bit before just turning it over. And frankly when most students, when they've looked at this they like,
this is kind of eye-opening. You can see where I've been at and
what time of day it was. And I don't know whether
any students backed off of consenting to be a part of
the study after seeing it. But at least it gave them more
upfront information than just saying, okay location data, check, yes,
here, faculty member can have it. So another question that I wanted to
ask you is I was curious is there some other example that I should
be asking you about that? I doubt because you know much
more about your job than I do. So are there any personal experiences
are instances where you've had to make decisions that implicate
ethical principles or dilemmas or? >> My office frequently will get requests
or has received requests asking for things about did such and such a person
look at such-and-such a content? And for me that there isn't
much ethical dilemma in it. >> Really?
>> So the request from staff or professors or? >> There have been requests from
faculty and from staff managerial. I see people and
seeking to do what I always call managing by review of activity. >> Right.
>> And we don't do it. We simply don't and in fact even in my
previous job in the private sector. I didn't know this when I joined but
I had a couple of employees and my first week their eyes. I don't know where I got
an email saying okay, here's all the websites that your
employee went to this week on. They're on their computer that they use
for work whether the websites on the bad list or were they just all
the website was all the website. Trust me this this particular
organization filtered all the bad stuff. I see and I was part of the And I was part of the privacy
office at this organization. And I raised this with my boss, and we
actually ended up killing this as a thing. And we got a lot of complaints,
because people would become used to. Well, if Saul is looking at CNN, and think of any legitimate website,
then he must be wasting his time. And so we have occasionally received
those requests at Michigan, and the answer is no. The only time we provide that sort of
information to anyone is if it comes under subpoena or warrant or some other legal
order that's going to compel us to. And even then, we work with our general
counsel's office and try to fight it. >> Yeah, I mean, one dimension of
the university that we haven't talked that much about that probably must come
up sometimes is health and medicine. Because universities are these
weird combinations of things in the United States, where they often
have hospitals built into them. And that's a big part of Michigan,
so is that something that comes up? Because there's a whole different
regulatory apparatus there. >> So it does,
I have peer on our health system side. And they have a different approach
to some of these issues because they are both from a regulatory perspective and
just a business perspective. Our health system is far
more like a business, especially if you strip
out the medical school. And so they in some areas take a more,
I will call a more businesslike approach. Whether it's asking their employees,
it includes their faculty and their staff, to have certain software
on their personal devices if they want to attach their personal
devices to their network. So you know, at the University of
Michigan, you can jack your computer, [LAUGH] your personal computer. You could be running Windows XP,
for all I know, into our network. And students could put their
personal devices on our network. That's just how we operate,
that's how higher ed operates. Because of the nature of the business
they do in the health system, you have to run special software
on your personal device if you want it to attach
to the network at all. And they are tough to get them. >> And this software secures the device? >> Yes, but there's also privacy and
ethical ramifications. What reports does that device provide
back to your personal device, back to the central security group? >> Right, I know one reason you might use
these apps if you were an organization. Is they would detect if your operating
system of the device had been patched for security vulnerabilities,
or something like that. And it would either help you install them,
install them itself, or just report that you didn't have them,
that it was vulnerable. But it's true that I also have read
that some of the apps used for this purpose, they are installed
with the permission that you grant control of
the device to the app. So the app can take control of the device
or send any information on the device to, I guess, your employer. And if you have an employer that mandates
this as a part of your job if you want to use your phone,
I think most people are consenting. >> Mm-hm, well, [LAUGH] consenting
in that if they want to use their personal device on that network,
they have to abide. >> I see. >> So maybe they're abiding,
and not consenting. >> Uh-huh, yeah, no, that's true,
and that's a key idea about consent. That it has to be meaningful,
yeah, and a real decision. Well, I mean, I think the last question
I had was the one where I asked you if you had any more questions for me. So unless you have any other examples you
like to share, this has been so useful. >> Gosh, I'm just trying to think
about other ethical dilemmas. So here, this would be both an ethical. I don't know if it's a dilemma or
not, but a question for you. So we're doing learning analytics
at the University of Michigan. Our students are, in some way,
shape, or form, data subjects. >> Right. >> So we collect that same
information about you. Okay, maybe you don't live in a res hall. Maybe you don't use your M
card in a dining hall a lot. >> Faculty analytics. >> Yeah, so faculty, we could just as easily be doing
faculty analytics as student analytics. And one of the things I often posed to
the researchers working in this space is, how do you feel about that? What if analytics data was
being provided to your chair or your dean that would say, well. If Christian was only better in
these ways, based on the data, that he would be a better researcher or
a better teacher. >> Well, I mean, just to fit it to
the flip side of learning analytics. I feel like it would have
to be teaching analytics. Where you would get little
nudges that would say like, did you remember to grade this paper? You really have to grade it, or I noticed
that you missed a couple of the lectures that you were supposed to give,
what's going on? We're going to have to flag a professor
advisor, or something like that. That would be, I think, the equivalent
of that, yeah, and how would I feel? I mean,
I'm not super excited [LAUGH] about that. >> [LAUGH]
>> Yeah, I'm not super excited about that. I mean, I think, yeah, an interesting
thing about being a professor is that one of the things that professors
are valorized for is being eccentric. It's one of the jobs where you're
expected to be different and to be weird. And it's a little bit of
a caricature of itself, but a lot of professors play to it. So the idea of of normalizing everything
is the fear that you raised earlier. And it seems like a particularly
difficult fit with this job. Because we know that in teaching, we teach our professors that
there's no one right way to teach. And there's actually many positive and successful ways to teach that depend
on the style of the faculty member. And sometimes even just the composition of
the student group they're trying to teach. Or even the weather or
time of day, or something. It's a process that involves a lot
of randomness and variation. And so it's interesting to think of
normalizing the professor experience. I mean, it seems like, in some way, what we're selling to the students
is that professors are weird. And we want them to be sort
of eccentric and strange and have purple hair occasionally. >> [LAUGH]
>> But not all of them, because that would be too normal. But yeah, I don't know, I haven't
actually thought about it that way. So I'm going to have to think
about it some more, but yeah. >> Yeah, so some universities have dipped
their tail, let's just put it that way. And I think you're nailing [LAUGH] what
I think the appropriate response is. And I would hope that applies to students. In the same way we don't
want our faculty to conform, that there is no one right way to teach
a course or to provide information. There's no one right way to
consume information or to learn. And the challenge or risk in some of these analytic spaces is
if you're relying on the data, the data, the data and machines that
the more we machine learn it and algorithm it,
where there's less human touch. I think we move towards
a more conforming blah. Maybe everybody has some level
of mediocre success world. But that's not what makes
the world great or interesting. >> And your last point, which I'm
still mulling over, is a great one. Because we often think of data subjects or people about whom data is gathered, and
there's always a power differential. Sometimes we acknowledge it,
sometimes we don't. There's a famous quote by Sandra Harding
that I'm going to butcher. But it says something like, employers
have all the opportunities in the world to perform studies to figure out how to
make their workers get by with less and be more productive. But workers rarely have the opportunity
to commission studies to figure out how to get capitalists to get by with less
profit and to give more money to them. But surely,
studies like that could be performed. >> Yeah. >> Well, I think we can end it there,
but thank you so much, Saul. I really appreciate you
coming in [CROSSTALK]. >> My pleasure, this is a blast.
