Hi there, welcome back. This is another case study in our week when we're talking about provenance and asking
questions about who's left out of data
science analysis. This week, I have another
interesting case study for you. This is a brief one, but it's a very important one we wanted to be sure to mention. It has to do with
the relationship between where the
technologies of data science are going versus the populations that are able to be measured
and studied by data science. So I'll say a little bit more clearly what I mean by
talking through an example. This is a little older example. I don't know if you
would have seen it. But in 2010, Mayor Cory
Booker got a lot of attention because
during a big blizzard in the East Coast of
the United States, he started using Twitter
to direct the resources of his city to people that
were trapped by snow. So he directed the snowplows using conversations on Twitter. At the time, that
was an amazing thing and people were quite
excited about it. So in this news clip
I'm showing you, the headline is The Mayor of Twitter and
Blizzard Superhero. So pretty straightforward story, is simple case study. I think you may have already experienced some of
the aftermath of this story. So here in Ann Arbor, I have an app on my
phone that allows me to do the same thing that
this story is describing, but with an app,
not with Twitter. Although I think I
can also tweet at a variety of municipal
and governmental people, if I wanted to use Twitter. I think the app is called
SeeClickFix and it helps you request government
service by taking a picture with your phone and
submitting it to the city, so I can report a pothole or some garbage or
something like that, a block lane of traffic even, and the city will try to fix it. Now the reason this is an interesting case study for us this week is that the problem of, does data science always
leave something out? It's actually a different
problem when you think about the provision
of government services. Because government services, unlike services in
the private sector, usually there's a
bedrock assumption that you must serve everyone. You really need to provide
services to everyone, perhaps everyone who's
a citizen in some case, but usually just everyone. It's really important that we recognize the
incompatibilities between everyone and what we're getting in a
data science analysis. So one of the
reasons data science is exciting and that
you may have gotten into this degree program or
decided to change your career to call yourself a data scientist is that there are now more data. So we have data about
all kinds of things. Some of the key drivers
of the explosion of data are the proliferation of computers throughout
society measuring things. But specifically, one
big driver of interest in data science has been the
cell phone and social media. Because social media
has proven to be a gigantic collector for data that's used in
a variety of ways. Some obviously have turned out to be negative and
we're unhappy about them. But also the cell phone with
its built-in sensors and accelerometer and camera
and Internet connection. So the cell phone is also an amazing data collection tool. So if you think about
being a data scientist, if such a term existed in the 1980s or something
when I was a child, where would you get the
data for a lot of things that we do now routinely? The thing I'm pointing out with this case study is that when we use data science in the
provision of government service, it's absolutely crucial
that we think about the sampling bias in the
technologies of data collection. So in this case, the time story celebrates Cory Booker for using Twitter to help people trapped in snow get rescued by snowplows. But there's a huge
mismatch in this story between the people that need help and the technologies
that he's using. So at that time, Twitter is still not
a majority platform, the majority of the population
does not use Twitter. But in 2010, it was really
a tool of elite and generally technophilics
or people who like technology and like new
things and younger people. So it's interesting that
this particular problem of public service provision where digging people out of the
snow who are trapped, the people who are
most likely to need this service might
be the elderly, the people who can't dig
snow for themselves, for example, the disabled
and at least the elderly is the exact opposite to the population on Twitter. So it's interesting that
this was so celebrated, even though it's, I think the exact opposite
of what we should be doing in government
service provision. So here's a quote that I
like from Eszter Hargittai. It's just a very simple
quote from a recent study. "Big data derived from social media tend to oversample
more privileged people." It's a good maxim to keep
in mind because a lot of the excitement in Data Science is the availability of
data from social media, but also from the phone. So let's just try to put
this in perspective. Remember that if you
were to do, for example, a web survey requiring people
to use a desktop computer. In the United States, in 2019, only three-quarters of
the population have a desktop computer
connected to the Internet, according to the Pew. You can look up the
right statistics for your own country or for more recent date
in the United States. But think of that through, that 75 percent is not a random
sample of the population, it's not a random 75 percent. There are reasons in there as to why those people
have a computer, it has to do with
cost, for example. It might have also to
do with education, that would be another example. So the idea that class is
built into this means that if you're doing a study that requires people to fill out
a survey on a computer, you're already going to
miss maybe some trend that is only visible in
a subpopulation. Same thing is true of the phone, although phones are very, very common in the United States, 2019, 96 percent
of the population. Even there, four percent of the US population is a
significant number of people. They might be the people most in need of a
government service. So it might be
challenging to roll out services for example, the elderly or the disabled who might be those
less likely to have a phone, even in those four percent. But I think people like, maybe people like
me tend to assume phone these days is a smartphone. But the smartphone is again
only 75 percent in 2019. So that's three-quarters
of the population, leaving out a quarter
of the population is a lot, especially because again, we don't think that that's a
random sample of 75 percent, there are reasons why people
might pay for a smartphone. These reasons often have
to do with privilege. So this was just watch out example to emphasize
how sampling and bias are related to privilege
and that can lead you to make some errors in your
data science analysis. So that's the second
segment that's about case studies for this week, and I'll see you again next time.
