Welcome back. Now I'd like to talk to you
a little bit about some distinctions
between things in our course that are going to turn out to be important later. This is a segment where we're
going to talk about how to do Data Science Ethics in
the context of this course. The first distinction
I want to highlight, the course is about concepts. So we're going to
talk about concepts, and you can think about these as ideas or tools that are used by practicing data
scientists as they're thinking through some
decision they have to make. So that means a couple
of things for you. One thing that it means is that we're also going to talk about what you could call cases or you could think of them as examples, but the cases and examples are really meant to
illustrate the concepts. So for the most part, we're not going to test you
on the cases and examples. Now, there are some cases and examples that are so famous among Data Science practitioners
that you might want to remember them anyway
because you could say, "Well, whoa, everyone's
going to remember this in data science". So you might want
to know about it. I'll try to flag those as we proceed
through the material, but I just want to emphasize that for the course as a whole, you could think of
it as in two bins, and one bin is concepts and one bin as
cases and examples. Really what we want
are your ability to use the concepts to
get things done and we work through the
cases and examples to apply the concepts
or to illustrate them, but we're not going to ask
questions about, for example, "What year did the Nazis invade the Netherlands
in World War II?" It was 1940, but that's
not what we're after. We're really after concepts. The other thing I wanted
to highlight that's an important thing that people sometimes mix up is that
as you take this course, I would really encourage
you to think of it as substantive material that could be useful to you in your career. I say that because
in some disciplines, there's an ethics class
and it's a little bit like a checkbox that's on
top of the degree. So let's say you're a
business school student and I believe we have some
business school students in the class probably. If you went to business school, there's often a requirement
for a business ethics class, but after you graduate, you can't usually find a
job titled Business Ethics. It's just something that is
a part of a degree program, but it's not something that
exists on its own as a job. Legal Ethics is the same way. You get a law degree, but then you don't get a job
as a legal ethicist usually. It's just a part of the law. This class does not
work like that. Ethics is absolutely booming. It is not something that's a add on to your ethics degree. It's a full-featured
specialization in Data Science. Let me give you an
example of that. I don't know if you're familiar, but there have been a series of really substantial
ethical controversies hitting the tech industry
in just the last few years. A lot of excitement is
about developments in artificial intelligence
and the companies involved, for example, Google, have been struggling to assuage fears among
their customers that artificial intelligence
will lead to terrible consequences for them as individuals or for society. Google even went
so far as to make a new ethics board to try and convey the idea that ethics are really important
in their roll-out of artificial intelligence. Then the ethics board failed because it itself was
so controversial. So ethics isn't really a side car in Data
Ethics right now. It's a booming area where people are really interested in
expertise about ethics. So for you, what does that mean? I think one thing that it
means is that you might consider the ideas here as a potential
specialization yourself. We know from my
conversations with former students and from people working in
industry and government, that there is demand for
specialization in ethics. So it's not really something
that's just an add-on, it could be a
specialization in itself. One other thing I
wanted to highlight, on Coursera, I've asked you to look at the syllabus
carefully and to read it, but there's one section of the syllabus I want
to particularly emphasize because it might not be the same as other courses, and this is how we do ethics in the context
of this class. It's called the
Guidelines for Dialogue. Now, the Guidelines
for Dialogue was a project that a group of
University of Michigan students embarked upon
to try and improve classroom discussion
about topics that were perhaps uncomfortable
or difficult, or where passions are high and this class has
some topics like that. The Guidelines for Dialogue
were their answer. It's a series of steps and the steps in
the guidelines are suggestions for how to
talk about things with other students in a
class like this one, to be sure that
everyone feels like the conversation is productive
and we have learning, but we also have a sense of respect for our
fellow students, and we don't come out of it with a feeling that there's been
a giant fight and we lost. That's not what we're after. So I ask you to look at
those guidelines, again, developed by
University of Michigan students for talking
about difficult topics. That would be most relevant
if you were posting in, for example, the discussion
board for this class. So we want to be sure to
adhere to those guidelines. I'll let you look at them, but they have things in there like, "Be sure to challenge the
idea and not the person". They have suggestions
about being sure that you don't look
down on someone for not having an experience
that you've had or perhaps for having an
experience that you didn't have. I'll let you look
at them, but I just wanted to flag that that
is an important part of this course and I
think it'll help you get the most out of it. One other thing that
I think is very important in this class is that the University of
Michigan participates in a therapy dog program. It's operated by a
charity called TheraPaws. The way that this works is
that instructors like me can request a therapy dog to
benefit student wellness. So let me give you an example. If you were here on campus, your instructor could ask for a therapy dog to visit class, and I've done that in the past, or sometimes the library requests a therapy dog during
midterms or during finals. The idea behind it is
that just being around a friendly dog is good
for student wellness. It's supposed to
lower blood pressure. It's supposed to
just be enjoyable. The last time I
requested a therapy dog, a rumor got started that the reason there was a
therapy dog in my class was actually that
the university was afraid because my
class was so hard, they thought that there
might be liability from students having
mental breakdowns, so they assigned a therapy
dog to calm people down. I want to let you know that's not true and it's a really
interesting rumor, but the reason that
I'm interested in the therapy dog program is I do think that it has benefits
for student wellness. So when I was asked to
teach an online class, I thought to myself, "Gosh, it just doesn't seem fair
that the online students have no access to this
therapy dog program". So I've worked with
the people who produce our online courses
and I'm very happy to say that we're
going to have a visit from Johnny Cash the Sixth, who is a standard poodle and a therapy dog that works at
the University of Michigan. Now I realize that this is somewhat corny and
it's somewhat cheesy, but I still think
it's worthwhile. I also realize you can't pet the therapy dog if the
dog is on the screen, but we all know there's
a long tradition of people looking at cute
animals on the internet. So I think that you can still get some benefit from Johnny Cash. I'm going to talk to
Johnny Cash about Data Science Ethics in segments that occur
once every week, and I'll ask him his opinions
about Data Science Ethics. All right. I know it's cheesy,
I know it's a gimmick, but I still think that
you should have access to all the cheesiness and all the gimmicks that an
offline student would.
