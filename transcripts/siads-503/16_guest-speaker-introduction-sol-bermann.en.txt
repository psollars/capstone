Hi there. I'm here in this segment to give you an
introduction to a guest speaker that we're bringing in named Sol Berman. Sol Berman is really an asset
to this class and I'm so glad that I was able to land him and
convince him to come. The reason he's an asset in part is that
we're lucky to have him here in Ann Arbor. So we'll get to have a conversation with
him in person and not by teleconference, but also because of his resume
which really bears on our course. So Sol Berman was the international
privacy officer for the Walmart Corporation. So he has experience in a very
large corporate organization thinking about issues of privacy. But he also has experience in government. He was the Chief Privacy Officer for
the state of Ohio. So he also has experience there. He's currently the Executive Director
of Information Assurance and the Chief Information Security Officer
of the University of Michigan system as a whole including all
campuses including Ann Arbor. His background is a legal one. So he holds a JD from
the Ohio State University and he's also been quite active
in technology policy. And so that's a nice overlap with the
issues that were raised in this course. So he was active in a particular caucus,
in an organization called Educause which is an important organization of
higher education educators that try to think about in part how
educators should use advanced computing technology for
learning in higher education and that's a topic I bet we'll talk something
about in the interview with him. He also has a master's degree from
the University of Virginia and a bachelor's degree from Beloit College,
which I believe is in Wisconsin and just a sort of nice detail about him is that
in his spare time he is a photographer. So he's an artist and
photographer in his spare time. So not sure if he thought I would
mention that or not but there it is and you can also read more about him
online because his resume is so long. I didn't actually list all of his
accomplishments which are which are varied and impressive. So let's hear from Sol Berman.
