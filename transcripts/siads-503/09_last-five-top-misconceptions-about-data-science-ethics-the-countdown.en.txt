We're here at the last five
of the top 15 misconceptions about Data Science Ethics. I grouped the last five together because they're all about data, which is our wheelhouse here
in Data Science Ethics. So what are the top
misconceptions about ethics and data science, or
data specifically. Number 11 is that
being technical and working with data and being
ethical are opposites. I put this here
because I think it follows pretty logically from the last one that I talked about. You need to be technical in order to be ethical
because you have to understand the implications of the analyses that you're doing and if you don't understand them, you're not going to
be able to reason about their consequences. So that means that you're
being more technical is likely to make you more
ethical like that's related. So I think it's clear why technical and ethical or not opposite directions
that you might move in. I understand why sometimes
people think about ethics or morality or something like that
as a soft skill, but I don't think that's an
accurate way to describe it. It's not that there's a different group of people that are out there thinking
their ethical thoughts. It's really, it's our job, as I said in the last segment. So these aren't exclusive and they aren't competing goals. They're really one and the
same. They're linked together. Number 12 might seem a little controversial to
you because we were told quite often as data scientists that you have
to respect the evidence, you have to respect the data, you have to present the data, you have a duty to the truth, you have a duty to reality. I think these things are
true but at the same time, I think there's
widespread agreement that the data do not speak
for themselves. There's a variety of
ways to put this one. Famous one is that there's
no such thing as raw data, raw data is an oxymoron. But I mean, we can think of other ways to say the same thing. This is the book cover
for a book called How to Lie with Statistics with one
example diagram from it. It's a book from the 1950s,
it's a really old book. The reason I brought it
up is that it's actually by far overwhelmingly
the most commonly used book about statistics. So it's the most
commonly assigned one in statistics courses
across decades. It's fallen somewhat
out of favor now, but I think there
is a new edition. I think it still is
widely used but over the course in which there has been a thing called statistics, the most common book to teach statistics has been about
How to Lie with Statistics. Now I know that
obviously the author wanted a catchy title
but really the book is about how to lie with statistics and built into
the assumptions of the book are that it's not just that you present the evidence
and you're finished. There's a whole
class about how to present evidence from
data science analyses. But the ethical concern here
that we want to highlight, is that we can't just take it for granted that once you
say what the numbers are or the conclusion
of the analysis is or something like that,
that you're done. Your responsibility is to
think about that presentation. Number 13 is a little hairy but I think that
we can get there. Number 13 is the idea that ethical decisions are
not about individuals. It's a misconception
that they are. Ethical decisions might
involve reasoning about individuals but it's usually
about more than that. So if you're a big
fan of statistics, one of the things that
you might learn in a statistics class is that
when you're doing an analysis, if you change the
level of the analysis, the unit of analysis, you can change the outcome. Another way to put
that if you don't like that particular comparison
is you could say, if I do a study of what
individual people do by adding up what they do and I do a study of what an
organization does, even though an organization is a group of people added up, it might actually
behave differently. There might be different things. So ethical decisions aren't usually about individuals
and I think it's often a fallacy or an error when
we start our reasoning about ethics by adding up
individual things. Like there is this many
people that want to do that, and there's this many people
that want to do that. Therefore, we have to decide
for the bigger group. There's some justification in doing that but there's usually some other dimensions that are left out when you're doing
that kind of analysis. This also relates
to my earlier point when I spoke about how it's possible for
a group of people, for each person to make a good decision that they
believe is the right one, and yet for the group as a whole to then do
something wrong. So that's another instance where thinking solely in
terms of individuals probably isn't going to be the best strategy for coming up with a good analysis of what's happening or what should happen. Another way to put that, I guess, might be if we talk
about ethical decisions in terms of individuals. I think another way of
putting that fallacy is that some people mistakenly think that ethical decisions are really when they go wrong, that's because there's Dr. Evil or some like
really bad person who made the wrong decision. They think that ethics is about villains and it's
about assigning blame. One of the challenges I had when I was working in this area, in partnership with
people from industry, is that people in Silicon
Valley or in the tech industry, when public opinion
started to turn against them because of
a number of scandals, they became very defensive and it became very difficult
to talk to them about problems relating
to what they should do, or ethics or justice
or things like that. I hope you're not defensive right now by anything that we
covered so far in the class. I don't mean to
make you defensive and I generally think
you shouldn't be because we're going to talk
about things like racism. But when we talk about racism, it's not that we're looking
for the evil racist. I'm not saying that there
aren't any evil racists. Indeed, there may be evil racist. It's just that as an
overall strategy, we often find that there isn't just one bad
actor in the basement. We usually find that there are some systemic or
structural problems that produce an
outcome that nobody likes and that's what
we need to address. So yes, in fact, there are people who are bad. I'm not saying that there aren't. One of my earlier
misconceptions was about how some people
are bad at ethics. So I definitely believe that. But at the same time,
we don't want to stop with some analysis
of individuals. So my job as someone
interested in Data Science Ethics is
not to go on some hunt inside a data science
group and find the person who it turns out is in the
movies as the bad guy. That is not usually
what it looks like. In many famous examples
of disasters that have occurred because of
ethical failures related to data science, the conclusion at the
end was that there quite often wasn't a bad guy, was a series of decisions and each of them incrementally
did something, but their full implications weren't clear at the time until you saw them all together. So even though there were lapses, it often wasn't evil. So your job, if you
want to be ethical, is not to seek out evil
individuals and admonish them. So all right, I said
enough about that. I think you get the
idea. Number 14. Now, this one I think
might strike you as controversial as
well, but I hope not. People often think that data
science is about numbers. Another way you could put
this is that it's about data. Really, I don't think that's
what data science is about. There's a famous essay
about this that says that the way to think
about data science is that it's actually about people. Because even when
you look at data that seem like they don't
have to do with people. If you look hard enough, there's some people
in there and that's really where you should
be putting your focus. I'll give you an example. Earlier in my career, I did some work related to wireless communication
and I was particularly interested in some questions
about whether radios were using the
electromagnetic spectrum in a certain way or not. So I did some research about that and on the one hand,
you might say, this sounds like it doesn't have to do with people
because you're doing data analyses with data about radios and the
question that you're answering is about physics. It's about wave propagation
and electromagnetic energy. It's not about people, right? I mean, you just do
the analysis and does the radio receive the signal or does it not receive the signal
and it seems like you could say it's
very objective and it just doesn't really have
that much to do with people. I'm not saying that
maybe you couldn't find some natural science example that was really hard
to link with people. But I am saying that
even things that don't seem like they're about people
often are and in my case, that was extremely true. So for example, my
students went on to work in a non-governmental
organization to do policy work about
wireless communication. He told me this great story. He said that he came out with a report and I looked
at it and I was really impressed because
the report really went through and critically
attacked a bunch of technical findings
that had been produced by a wireless company and I
just really took it apart. It was very incisive and
detailed and nuanced. I said that to him and
he said funny story, the people who wrote this report, more or less, that
you're praising are the same people that wrote the report
they're criticizing. What? I said I don't understand. What it was is that in
wireless communication, the allocation of
frequencies can result in implications for a business that are valued at over
a billion dollars. That would not be that uncommon. The amount of money at stake
in these things is so high. So the engineering group at one of the wireless
companies that produced the industry analysis, they were told by
their bosses that the analysis had to
come out a certain way. So they did it, the
analysis came out that way. They needed, I suppose, support their family and they
wanted to keep their job. Then at night, they went to
see my former student at the advocacy organization and
they said, you know what? That analysis that we just
wrote is full of shit and let's go through and figure
out what's wrong with it. The fact that it seems like data science is about numbers was working to the advantage of a company that was
essentially lying. So they wanted you to think that data science was
about science and numbers and it had
nothing to do with politics or money or business and that was
their cover story. So that's why it's so
important to recognize that data science is about people and all the messy stuff
that comes with people, including the politics
and the money, does work its way into your work practice
as a data scientist. Working data scientists,
I think agree completely with this in the majority
of cases anyway. So data science is not
just about numbers. So my 15th and final one, I hope, is not too controversial. I think it might be, but I'm not super sure where everyone's
coming from because I know we have a diverse group of students enrolled in the
program and in this class. So my last misconception is the idea that
numbers are neutral, or you could say
numbers are objective. That's another way to put it. The reason that's a
misconception is that, as we'll see later in the class. So this one, I think is not quite as much of a
assumption I'm making, but I will try to demonstrate it to you a little bit more, is that how you assign numbers to things is hugely influential
in their meaning. Maybe this is obvious to you, but just in case it's not, I mean, we'll get to
it a little later, but for now I think just
try to keep in mind that quantification is not in itself a process that frees us
from ethical judgments. So if I turn something
that's qualitative into a quantitative value, that doesn't mean that
I have somehow cast it free of any ethical
debate or in fact, any other kind of debate as well like a political debate or an economic debate or
ideological debate. So just turning something
into a number doesn't by itself make things
somehow more fair, more neutral, more
objective, more ethical. There's nothing inherently
more ethical about numbers. In fact, we could go back
to that earlier slide, how to lie with statistics
and there's a whole bunch of really unethical
numbers in there. So that's the way I'd love
for you to think about it, is that turning something
into a number is actually a point at which
we start to have problems. Like we say, wait did we turn this into the
number the right way? Unlike the other
14 misconceptions, this one is a little different
because we are going to have some material in the
class about it directly. So if you don't believe me with this one and you believed
me with all other 14, I hope then just hang on to it and we are
going to get back to this one a little later in the class when we talk
about classification. This the top 10 lists
except it was 15 and the top misconceptions about data science ethics.
I'll end it there.
