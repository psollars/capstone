As you've probably gathered by following
the variety of topics in this course, the world of machine learning encompasses
a broad set of ideas and methods, and the field itself continues
to advance rapidly. So the goal of a survey course like this
one is to cover the most important basic concepts and visit a few of the more
important and interesting areas. And hopefully, inspire you enough to continue
exploring after you finish the course. I've put together this course so it's not
only a source of lectures and assignments, but also collection of useful
readings you can draw on. Based on my experience in this area that
I've chosen for you as a good starting points to continue your learning and
different aspects of machine learning. By now, we've covered quite a bit of
ground, starting with an understanding of the general concepts and
workflow of applied machine learning. And then getting some exposure to
a variety of learning algorithms for important tasks like classification and
regression. Along with an understanding of the
important parameters that control model complexity for these algorithms. You should now have a better understanding
of critical problems like overfitting and data leakage. Along with an idea for some strategies
you can use for detecting and avoiding these problems. We've covered how machine learning
algorithms are evaluated on how to tune their out parameters to optimize
different evaluation criteria that may be appropriate for different tasks. Finally, we've applied these ideas
with the help of notebook examples and assignments to gain more experience with a
very powerful machine learning library in Python Scikit learn. I want to say something briefly about
important family of machine learning tasks that we've touched on in this course,
but didn't focus on specifically, and that is machine learning
that involves text. This concludes problems such as email,
spam detection and classifying web pages by topic. The course following this one in our data
science series focuses specifically on text mining and
machine learning with text. So if you have a particular interest in
diving into the use of natural language processing with machine learning,
I encourage you to check it out. Thanks for your interest in this course. I've really enjoyed putting together this
tour through the fascinating field of machine learning. I hope this course helped you in some way
along whatever path of exploration you might have. And as always, we welcome your
feedback on any aspect of this course. Thank you and
all the best in your own future learning.
