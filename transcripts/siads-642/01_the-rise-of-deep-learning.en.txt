Hi, this is Paramveer Dhillon. I'm an Assistant Professor
in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I would like to welcome you all
to this course on deep learning. Today's lecture,
we'll introduce you to this new and exciting field of deep learning. I am sure that all of you have
heard of the term deep learning. We are currently living in the midst of a
deep learning revolution, sparked by deep learnings unprecedented success in
several real world applications. For example, deep learning models have shown mastery
of board games such as Go and chess. In 2016, a computer Go program
called AlphaGo beat Lee Se-dol, a top ranking professional Go player. Of late, there has also been development
of certain deep learning models that allow us to generate realistic but
fake images of people and pieces of art. This has important implications for the
functioning of our society and democracy. Deep Learning has also enjoy immense
success in numerous other applications. For example in healthcare,
deep learning models have aided clinicians in reading radiology reports and
in screening of breast cancer. As far as economic and
financial applications are concerned, deep learning algorithms have predicted
the stock market with high accuracy. As well as have aided in creating
an automated index for cryptocurrency. That said, perhaps the greatest
success of deep learning and one that has touched most of our
lives is in machine translation. Deep learning models have
significantly improved the quality of machine
translation over the last decade. We will study the models
behind some of these commercial successes later in this course. All of these advances have helped
us move towards the broader goal of building artificially
intelligent systems. Next, let's look at the field of
deep learning from 30,000 feet. The broader societal and
scientific aim has always been to build intelligent systems that mimic
human behavior or intelligence. This is what we call
artificial intelligence. The field of AI contains within it
a sub-field known as machine learning. Whose focus is to build statistical
techniques that enable computers to improve at tasks with experience. Deep learning is a further sub-field of
machine learning, which mostly deals with pattern extraction from large amounts
of data via artificial neural networks. Now a question arises
as to how specifically is deep learning different than
traditional machine learning? In order to answer that, let's consider
the standard machine learning pipeline for the task of predicting whether
an image contains a cat or not. The standard ML pipeline in this case
consists of first of all, collecting labeled images containing positive,
as well as negative examples of cats. Next, we manually extract features
from the images that we think based on our domain knowledge are predictive
of an image containing a cat or not. Finally, we train some classifier such as
a logistic regression, or a support vector machine, and SVM to predict whether
that image contains cat or not. And we get some corresponding accuracy for
our classifier. Next, let's look at how deep
learning solve this problems. Deep learning models automatically
extract relevant discriminative features from the images that will be helpful for
the classification task at hand. Further, since we do not know what's
the correct level of abstraction for the predictive features,
the neural networks extract these features hierarchically
at different levels of abstraction. For example, for
the face recognition task, these hierarchical features might
contain information ranging from the individual pixel values,
to corners, to edges, and whole parts. All of which combine to give us improved
accuracy on the face recognition tasks. The ideas at the heart of neural networks
have been around since at least the 1950s. But they have seen a big resurgence in
the last decade due to three main reasons. First, we now have access to large
amounts of data on which we can train deep learning models,
which typically have a lot of parameters. Second, advances in hardware such
as graphical processing units, GPUs, allow us to train these
models at a really fast speed. Finally, the development of improved
optimization techniques, and the ease of availability via high quality
free software frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or MxNet, has significantly
accelerated the progress in deep learning.
