Welcome back to our
discussion around design. I want to talk about one of Tufte's other
ideas specifically around chartjunk as it concerns communicative visualization
that is visualization that you're creating to communicate some idea to somebody else. His notion is that chartjunk is always bad
and we'll talk about that for a second. So just as a reminder Tufte comes from
what's known as the cognitive efficiency school that is thinking
about the best ways for people to be able to decode information. That is he doesn't care about other
properties like learnability, memory and so on,
just the ability to decode information. So it should be the most efficient
cognitive way to decode a visualization into its underlying data or
insights or whatever it is. The other one is that
Tufte is a minimalist and so lots of superfluous stuff in
the visualization is considered bad, which is why he's pushed for
this rule of thou shalt not use chartjunk. Okay, so Tufte does not like
visualizations that look like this. On the left you have, it's just a standard
kind of marketing visualization around text phones, around cell phones. Sorry and one electronic messages
come in put out by this company. On the right is a visualization
created by Nigel Holmes who's a very famous graphic illustrator
visualization illustrator. And if nothing else from
this visualization, you will probably never forget
this after this discussion. There's not a lot of data
being encoded here, but there's a lot of other
stuff on the visualization. Tufte's ideas that all the superfluous
stuff is a waste, right? Like you should not be using this, it violates the data ink concerns
that violates graphical integrity. There's a lot of stuff here
that he does not like. And so these are things that
should be avoided and so we're going to question this
hypothesis for a second. Okay, just as a reminder when we have
this puzzle piece view of the world. We are thinking about the tasks
that we want to support or think about in terms of abstract
tasks what we want to support and then ideally we want to come up with
the simplest cleanest representation again with the caveat that it should be
reasonable from a perceptual perspective. So we actually want to test our ideas and
when we throw away lines or add lines or whatever it is, but all comparisons should be supported in one
display if we can do it and that's great. Okay. And so this leads to this notion that
we should not have visualizations like this not just because of
their use of the wrong encoding so the life factor piece but because there's
map like this visual that's a road, is actually distracting
from the main point. So having this nice kind of clever
use of a metaphor of the road is not appropriate here because it's actually
distracting from the main point. So all the stuff underlying the data
would be considered chartjunk and should be removed. So let's look really quickly at how
Tufte chose to encode this data. So here's his clean take of the data set. Over here we have the time
series on a bottom. So you have 1978 through 1985. You have the time point for 27.5. This is how many miles per gallon you
got 1985 versus only 18 and 1978 and that's great. This visualization is very clean, right? Like you can make the kinds of comparisons
you want to make between 26 and 24 this change or the smaller change between
85 and 84 of only 0.5 miles per gallon. You can also see the trend over time,
which is relatively increasing. So we're getting better
fuel economy from our cars. So this is a great clean
version of the data set. No chartjunk, accurately labeled,
very readable, so on. So Tufte says you should stop here. You should certainly not
be doing things like this. Like you should not be adding this
extra stuff around it to make it more interesting, or whatever it is
because that's not actually useful. It's actually distracting from the data,
and so this is what he would consider to be
chartjunk and should be eliminated. So visualizations like this one on
the right where there's like this weird 3D nest to it or this one or
even this is worse. These are all chartjunk laden
visualizations that have lots of extra superfluous things that don't
add anything according to Tufte. So this should all be eliminated
from your visualization. Now, here's the thing when you're
looking at these visualizations, these are two from Nigel Holmes. If you think about what's actually
being encoded here the story that's underlying this and this one,
it's monstrous cost, right? So this is the title of the visualization. You see the teeth and coding the values
and you see this increase and it's this notion of monstrous
pervades this visual example. So the idea of using this extra stuff, this monster sitting underneath the data
is actually perhaps reasonable here given the point that the author of
the visualization is trying to make. They are trying to convince you
that there's a growth in price or whatever it is is really high and
scary and that should be something that should
be conveyed through the visualization. So just having a simple bar chart that
looks like this right, maybe doesn't really indicate to you how interesting
this kind of change over time is. And this diagram on the right
with this woman, and her legs suggestively showing this
data okay of the the diamonds price over over time going up and
then going down. This is something that is
perhaps again unnecessary, like maybe you don't need this
figure to have this information. But the position of the leg is actually
going to be something that's very memorable to you. I pretty much guarantee that of this
lecture these two visualizations will probably be the two that stick
with you over time, okay. So when I asked about monstrous costs and
the diamond visualization, you will probably be able
to sketch out the data for me even long after you've seen this video,
okay. The data itself is quite simple. There's not a lot of data
being encoded here, but you will remember it because of
these choices that have been made this chartjunk that has been added
that actually makes it more memorable. So people have tested this in a number of
different ways some of them a little more questionable than others. But we've seen a number of research
articles in the space where people have compared
visualizations of different types. So the type on the left are the Nigel
Holmes style visualization where there's lots of extra chartjunk but sort of attractive things that make it
in theory more memorable or engaging. And the visualizations on the right
which are the cleaned up versions of the same data. So a lot of the stuff is either being
represented at the basic line plot, like the legs on the top or
the visualizations on the bottom, right which are these
just basic bar charts. It turns out I'm not going to
go through all this data. They tested a bunch of different
memory tasks for people. So they would show them the different
visualizations and have them come back and basically describe what it is
that they remembered seeing. Turns out that the performance with
the visualizations on the left tend to be better. Okay, things were more memorable and
much less inaccurate than was expected. So in terms of accuracy,
like how people were reading them. They were equally as accurate but
in terms of recall, that's the set of bar charts over here. The Holmes ones that is these
visualizations tend to do better than the plain ones, okay? So performance in terms of accuracy
was basically the same but recall so these two plots basically people
remembered both the message and the actual values much better with
the chartjunk laden visualizations than the plane versions over here. Okay, so the takeaways. Chartjunk has pros and cons. In terms of pros it's memorable,
it's engaging, it's persuasive. And so if that's the point of
our message and when we're doing communicative visualization that
is often going to be the point. This is not often in one ear and
out the other. We want to have the reader learn
something from our visualization. Learning involves memory,
involves getting people engaged and so on and so using chartjunk is actually
going to be important in these cases. There is cons, okay. So in our particular choices of
chartjunk we can be biasing we can increase interpretability issues. We can make things not
really space efficient. So the same data is using much more space
on when we use chartjunk than when we're using a very simple visualization. And so sometimes those are going to be
important and we'll talk about things like bias when we talk about ethics later on
but these are things to consider and so chartjunk is not just immediately
something we should dismiss. That's the main point that I would
like for you to carry away from this. There are caveats for use but chartjunk is not something
that's just bad all the time.
