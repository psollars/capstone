Welcome back to
Perception and Cognition. I want to spend a little bit of time talking about colors, because this is actually
something that's very important, unfortunately it's
something that's actually really hard to think about, and there's many, many
choices that we have. But I'll give you some rules
of thumb to think about color when it
comes to visualization. People have thought about color for ever and ever and ever, people have tried to analyze, create taxonomies, understand it in
many different ways for ever. Like there's lots of
different historical examples of people building
weird kinds of color wheels, basically trying
to understand what color looks like and
what color means. There's lots of
modern examples of people trying to
capture color spaces, so there's different kinds of RGB for example,
red, green, blue, that little horseshoe shape, we'll talk about in a second, and something called lab color. These are things that people have thought about as
ways of describing color spaces perception in
relationship to color spaces, how to encode things given
different kinds of devices, so what works on the screen versus works on paper and so on. This again is
a really difficult topic to cover in great detail, but I want to give you
just a few basics. In the eye we have
rod cells and cone cells, and these are
the things that we will use in order to distinguish
different colors. The combination of these
will be the thing that will allow us to combine
the input signal into the eye, into some understanding
of the color that it is that
we're experiencing. This going to constrain
us in some ways because the human body is
constrained in some ways. So what are the ways that
people have talked about, and what they've thought
about color spaces and treatment of color? The first one that I want you
to think about is one that you've probably experienced if you've ever printed a newspaper, or seen a printed newspaper,
or anything printed, a glossy magazine, usually uses something called
CMYK color spaces. CMYK represents cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black, and the way we would encode a particular picture like
this one is a nice scenery. We would separate that out
and print first in cyan, then in magenta, then in
yellow, then in black, and just shift
the different prints just a slight bit so that when you're looking at the total image, you're able to see all these
different shades of color, and the combination of them and basically internalize them. That works well for printing, but not so well when we're thinking about
other kinds of devices. What people have done classically when thinking about things like the screen is encoded color
using RGB color spaces. So this cube represents the red, green, blue combination
of color spaces. So we basically encode each color as a combination
of these things, like a red value, a green value and a blue value, which tells us where we
should sit in that space. So if you've ever played with
software that supports RGB, you will probably have seen
these sliders where you can basically move around
the red amount, the green amount, and
the blue about to create new kinds of
colors together. The issue with RGB is
that if we think about all the colors that
we can actually present and that people
can actually understand, that as this gray area
in the back, RGB is only a small
fraction of the space. So we're actually limited
in the number of colors that we can encode using RGB. So this is constraining to us because we're not able to
represent the full spectrum, or the full perceptual ability
of human beings using RGB. It works well for some devices, it's easy to calculate, it turns out not to be
great for modeling color. An alternative colors phases HSL. HSL stands for hue, the H, which has color how
pure the color is, and that goes from 0-360. So you have red's over here, red's over here, and
it goes back to red. It's a big circle
basically in the space. You have saturation which is
how much gray we're adding. So it goes from zero
which is neutral gray, all the way to
the most vivid color. Then we have lightness
which goes from how much a black over here to how
much white we're adding. That usually goes from 0-100, or 0-1 or something like that. You can see if we
apply the slider, you can change the hue, you can change the saturation, and you can change the lightness. So that is a way of representing color that is different from RGB. Instead of this color cube, we have the cylinder
which is hue, saturation, and lightness, represented in
this particular image. This is actually much closer
to the way we perceive, and it turns out that this is
a reasonable way for us to think about color when we
think about visualizations. I just want to give
you one last thing, which is the lab color space. We have in lab color space an intent to better model
the way humans perceive color, and so this is a nonlinear way
of mapping color. We have the lightness which
ranges from zero to one, we have this red to green channel that's a which goes from
negative to positive, and we have this blue channel
which is yellow to blue. I'm just going to
rotate this cube. So you can see this kind of
interesting color space, but you can probably tell
that it's non-linear, it has to be represented
in this 3D space. Perceptual distances in
this space are actually linear, which is an interesting
phenomenon, so any distance between two points in
this color space are perceived to be equal if the Euclidean distance
between them is equal. So you draw two points and you measure
the distance between them, and then you move
those two points anywhere else in the space so
that distance is maintained, that is the
straight-line distance between them as maintained, perceptually people
are able to tell that those are the same
distance apart. Because of that is an interesting
phenomenon about this, but a very hard thing
for people to model and think about when they're building
visualizations. So you have lots and lots of different choices when
thinking about color spaces. RGB and CMYK are
easy to think about, but some of them are
device dependent, or printer dependent. Lab is hard to reason about, but it's very accurate
human perception, and HSL is probably
a nice balance in between. It's designed to be
aligned to perception, distances are
a little bit inaccurate, but it's easier to work with in terms of
computational things. So we will often use HSL when picking colors in visualizations. So in terms of picking colors, I want give you some resources, so some rules of thumb, and some actual software that will help you decide
which colors to use. Rules of thumb are
basically this: for ordered data or
quantitative data, luminance in the HSL space
is probably good, but you probably
don't want to use gray scale or too many shades
of gray scale to do this. Saturation can work, but it's
not as easily discernible, and it interacts with
other things like size. For nominal data
that is categories, you probably want to
use things like hue. So varying the hue in
these big steps will probably be something that a person can determine and
distinguish between. What you do have to
think about when making color choices is whether you have segmented
or continuous data. So at the top here
we have a bunch of continuous versions of
the color encoding. So you have blues
going from white over here to dark
saturated blue over here, and so you can see
this very continuous line, and that's sometimes
good when you have quantitative data and you need to show all these
different shades. Sometimes you'll find that a segmented version
is actually better. So binning different
pieces of data into different color categories makes certain kinds of
comparisons easier. So it's easier to tell the
difference between these two, for example, than if it
was a point like this. So if we're trying to look at the difference between
these two points, it becomes difficult
if we're not binning them in these very
obvious bin sizes. So continuous and segmented
is something to think about. The other thing to think about is sequential versus diverging. So some cases what
we're going to have are variables that go from a very low value to
a very high value, and we can use just two colors
to represent that. So in this particular case, the color on the left
that we're choosing maybe to represent low values is white, and the color on the right
that we're using to represent high values is kind of
these darker shades, almost black or
saturated versions. We can also use something
called diverging color scheme, where instead of going from
one color to the next, we're going to use
three different colors. So in this case, we're going to use one color over
here on the left, white in the middle, and then a color on
the right that's different. So again we can use colors over here to mean low
values like minus one, colors over here to mean
high values like one, and colors over here to
mean something like zero. So if we have this range
of values and we want people to be able
to discern between them, we can think about using
a diverging color scheme. So start color versus
n color or sequential just one and start color
going to neutral color, going to end color for diverging. This is a quick rule of
thumb diagram made by Cynthia Brewer that
basically reflects the different kinds of
data that we might have, whether we have binary data, qualitative data,
or sequential data, or diverging data and thinking about when we have
combinations of these things like maybe we have
variables that are both qualitative and sequential, or both diverging and binary. So what color choices should we use in order to encode this data. So we'll make this available
to you guys to look at, and when you're
thinking about using colors for two different
actual variables, you might want to think about this diagram and then
color choices using this. So what are the tools
that we have available? So Cynthia Brewer who created this diagram
over here actually has created this
really nice web tool that's mostly used for maps, but we will actually find it useful for constructing
visualization. When you look at it
you're going to be able to decide a bunch
of different things. Like you're going to be able in the interface to specify
the number of classes, so the number of
different things, you're going to say whether
it's sequential, diverging, or qualitative, and then it
will pick for you a bunch of different color schemes
that you might use and you can cut and paste those into whatever software
you're using. So this is a powerful
tool for getting really good color suggestions that work well perceptually. You'll also find
that you can specify that these things
should be colorblind, so it shouldn't be
printable and so on. So you can test a bunch
of different things, and see that they work. Slightly more sophisticated are these things like color picker, or chromaticity which
is a really nice tool that you're able to pick out
a bunch of different colors. You can see how those will look like in visualization examples, and it will also tell
you whether people with certain colorblindness will find the particular color
choices good or bad. So the takeaways
is that there are many ways to model color
and think about color, I've only covered some of them in this particular video clip. Some are easier to work with, some are better models
of human perception. Things like HSL I would recommend starting with just because they're easy
to think about, but there are many
pre-designed and validated color choices for
each task that you can rely on as a way
of getting started, or modify slightly for your task. All right. Thank
you for listening.
