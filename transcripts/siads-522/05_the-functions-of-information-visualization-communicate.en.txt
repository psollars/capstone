Welcome back to Introduction to Information Visualization. We've talked about
a couple of the functions, record and analyze of
information visualization. I want now switch gears to the last one which
is communication. You're often coming
to the visualization with a particular insight, that is you want to communicate that insight
to somebody else. You've discovered something, you want to show it
to somebody else and teach them about that insight
using a visualization. This is another one of Playfair. We're in Playfair first example. This is from 1786, showing a particular thing
about exports and imports into Denmark and Norway in
favor or against England. So this is showing over time. Again over here,
imports and exports, whatever it is or maybe it's
flipped and you can see it balance in favor of
England or balanced against. You can see this flip
that happens around 1750 something over here, that led to this flip. So the goal here is to communicate something
about the underlying data, this insight to that something interesting happened
in the 1750s, and suddenly the balance in favor of England
was very high, whereas before, it was against. This is an interesting way
to communicate that. So Playfair has chosen to use this particular visualization
in a communicative way to describe some insights about the particular things discovered by analyzing the data. In today's world,
we're often using analysts tasks and communicative
tasks simultaneously. So we have analysts doing something but then they need to tell other people about them. So in the act of producing visualizations
for analytical roles, or producing things that can be used for communicative purposes. So this is a visualization, very large display using
a system called Spotfire. It's a it's a nice system for
generating visualizations. The person has generated
some interesting facts about the data and then showing
them to an audience, to other people working
in the company, or people that they're
presenting to. So this is the communicative role after having discovered
something interesting. In this particular case, they
might be able to also make adjustments
dynamically as they're describing and people
are asking questions. So that's an interesting property where you can go back and forth between the analysts task
and a communicative task. This is an old example, Florence Nightingale's cause of mortality in the army
of the East. This was intended to
communicate the reasons why people were dying in
the Army in the 1850s. So she generated
this very nice map. This diagram, called the coxcomb, that basically
reflects the deaths over time and due to
different things. This was used to communicate to the army that this was a problem and what they
should do about it. So very powerful
compelling visualization, again abstract representation
that is showing something about
the underlying data that she discovered and wanted
to communicate. Jumping ahead, this is
an example from 2001. This is a visualization
of the Internet. So this is something
called the Opte Project, where they go and
collect a bunch of data about the conductivity of different computers
on the internet. It's a very interesting diagram, it's very hard to actually understand anything about
the underlying data. What this is communicating
is something interesting and inspiring
about the underlying data, but perhaps, not
something that's directly useable just by looking
at this visualization. So you might be able to see these different
clusters and things that are in the middle
of the visualization, things that are highly
connected, and so on. But without additional
information, this is not actually
particularly useful. So it has this function of being inspiring and great in
that sense engaging. But perhaps, not useful
for a specific task. That's perfectly fine. Not every visualization
will need to have some cognitive or
some learning role. We might just be
targeting inspiration, we might just be targeting learning in a very different way. But it's important to make
that distinction and be honest about that when making
visualization choices. We're actually trying
to communicate, or analyze something specific, or do we want to communicate some higher
level concepts like, it's inspiring or
something like that. This is another example. This is when you
don't have computers and can only resort to
these cardboard displays. So this is what happens in
the senate floor or congress, they're not allowed to show
anything that's computerized. So what they'll often
do is print out these interesting and sometimes
not so great displays of information in order to communicate something
about the data that they want to offer to others
in the audience. So either the TV audience or other members of Congress
that are sitting around. There's a really nice website
called Senate charts, which tracks all of
these things that you can see some labs, sometimes at the different
choices that they make, is an American flag necessary
for this visualization? Probably not, but it's
one that's intended to communicate and compel
something in the audience. It engages them in
a very specific way. People will often use
visualizations and the communicative role
for political purposes. So we'll talk about
this example a few times over the course
of these lectures. This is a visualization
of the interaction of different components
in the Obamacare medical plans. So
this is the ACA. So these are the interactions of the different things,
it is very ugly. This is a very ugly
visualization. All the different elements of it are graphically not nice, it looks complicated,
it looks messy, it looks like something
you don't actually want. As you might imagine,
this was put out by the Republicans as a way of communicating his very
negative view of Obamacare, and there are other forms of this that are much more positive. So this is again a very
political example of using information visualization and it communicative goal to
achieve some effect. The goal broadly of communicative
visualizations however, is to teach someone something, or at least to support
some teaching. So often, there's text
involved and we want to engage the reader or viewer in
some ways so that they learned something from the text by seeing the visualization. So this is going
to be critical for our understanding of
communicative visualizations. We're not trying to go in
one here and out the other, we're actually trying to
teach them something. At the root of all
of these things, analytical tasks,
communicative tasks, all visualization is
about comparison. It's about using the visual
system to compare things, bigger/smaller, up/down,
there/not there, like a pattern/not
like a pattern. This is going to be
key and cross-cutting across all the different kinds of information
visualization tasks. So the main takeaways are that we have three different
kinds of tasks, record analyze, and communicate with many different
kinds of subtasks. The analysts tasks are all
about pattern finding, the communicative task
are all about teaching and
everything in between. That is, you can have
tasks that involve both an analytical role
and a communication role, a recording role
and communication, or analyzed communicate
record all at the same time. So there are many different combinations
that are possible. So it's important to be able
to make the distinction. What is our current goal with this information
visualization, or the software that
we're building, or the particular technique
that we're using, and so on. But these are
the high level versions and making that distinction
in our head is going to be critical and useful for making determinations
about the best technique. Then in critiquing
other people's solutions, we're going to want to be able to apply this language
in a good way. With that, thank
you for listening.
