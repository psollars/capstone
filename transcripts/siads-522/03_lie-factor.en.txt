Welcome back to
our discussion about design. What I want to talk about
right now is something that was introduced by Edward Tufte
called the Lie Factor. It's something that
we're generally going to consider a good idea, but I'll show examples
as with all of these design suggestions of when it might work and
when it might not. But this one is usually
a great idea to follow. So what you see here is a visualization that
was recreated from an old New York Times article like a paper version
of the New York Times. What you have on
what is essentially the y-axis is a bunch of dates. Just let me go back
and do this again. You have a bunch of
dates over here, and this is the the
time points in history. On the what is essentially the x-axis you have
fuel economy standards. So how much miles per gallon you're getting at
that particular year. Now if you're looking
at this visualization, you might already start to
sense that something is wrong. Deciding to use
this metaphor of the road, they're actually forcing
a particular design choice on the visualization which
is going to shape the data in a way that it
wasn't supposed to be. So let's start removing some of the additional stuff
that's underlying. So let's start by
removing the road, and then let's try to reposition some of
this data over here. So now we've
basically all aligned it along the same axis. So we have the same fixed point. The distances between these
are a little bit different. That's okay for now. But
what I want you to notice is the differences between
the different bar length. The difference between
the 27 and the 26 which is one unit, is the same in size as the
difference between 26 and 24, and 26 minus 24, the difference is of course two. So the actual distance in the data is not being represented correctly
in the visualization. So this is the idea
of the Lie Factor. So the Lie Factor essentially
tries to compute this. It tries to understand the
difference between the size of the effect on the graphic versus the size of
the effect in the data. So let's imagine
that we'd printed this out and the bar on the bottom is 5.3 inches, like that's how much space it takes on paper and the bar at the top over here takes about
0.6 of an inch on paper. So what we're going to do to calculate the size
of the effect of the graphic is we're going to compare the numbers
like the inches. So we're going to
subtract 5.6 from 5.3 and divide it by 0.6 and then multiply by
a 100 to get a percent. So that gives us the size of
this change in the graphics. So how much are we observing in terms of percentage
change from 0.6 to 5.3? That's 783 percent. So that's the difference
between 0.6 versus 5.3. We'll also do the same thing for the same thing that we're encoding just using
the actual data. So the bottom bar, the one that we're
calculating is at 5.3 inches has a value of 27.5. That's how much miles
per gallon it is. The bar at the top 18 that's how much miles per gallon
we're getting in 1978. Divide that by 18
denormalized times 100. So the size of the effect in
the data is only 53 percent. So we're seeing
783 versus 53 when giving us a Lie Factor once
we divide that out of 14.8. Ideally, we should be
seeing a Lie Factor of one. There should be a perfect correspondence
between the size of the effect on the graphic and the size of
the effect in the data. We're seeing something
dramatically different when we calculate the Lie Factor for this particular
visualization. All right. So considering why
this is perceptually bad. Let's go back to
our puzzle piece model where we have what's
the domain task, the abstraction, and so on. In terms of domain tasks, we might have our person, the person we're trying
to communicate with, we might imagine that they have two different things that
they're trying to do. One is that they might be
designed to compare the miles per gallon between
two different time periods. The other is that they might want to see
the trend over time, both of which might be
supportable through the visualization that we saw before or a cleaned up
version of it anyway. So what that looks like in terms of obstruction
is that we're trying to compare quantitative
variables between times and also compare
quantitative variables over time. So a bar chart is
a perfectly reasonable thing. So we're supporting
this by encoding the quantitative thing
that we're looking at, the miles per gallon,
in this case as length, and ordering the bars
by time. This is great. This is expressive, and it supports both kinds
of comparisons. It's also effective because
we can use length as we remember from our discussions about the best
encoding techniques, to support this kind of
accurate comparison. Recall from Stevens' Law, that length is
a perfect correspondence between the actual length
and the perceived length. Whereas things like area and
volume don't work very well. So people have an assumption that an actual one unit
change in length, corresponds to a one unit length and change in
reality in the data. So when the length size doubles I expect that to mean that
the data is also doubling. When we have a
visualization like this, we're breaking that idea. In this case we're violating the viewers assumptions
or tricking them perhaps, into misunderstanding the data. Here's a few other examples
of Lie Factor in action. This is a little bit
more egregious. In this case,
they're representing the cost of oil in a barrel. This is also from
an old printed visualization. So we see this bar chart theory that is representing this data. So again we have time, like these barrels all have different dates associated with them, and we have values
associated with the price. It's impossible for
the reader here without some guidance
to understand whether they should
be calculating these values based
on the surface area, based on the volume,
like should we be treating the variables
as a total? In both cases, we're actually
getting the wrong thing. So there's a Lie Factor of
9.4 when we're looking at the surface area and if we're thinking of
this as a volume, like this is a 3D object which corresponding
to this difference of 454 percent to 27,000
percent which is pretty crazy. So in all cases, this may not be ideal because
we're not guiding the reader to understand how they should interpret
the visualization. Is it the height of the barrel? Is it the area of the barrel? Is it the volume of the barrel? Without guidance they
may not know what to do and they might default to
sort of the wrong thing. So we're breaking
this ideal thing of using the bar chart because
we're starting to use these other kinds
of encodings. The problem with this
is that we're not telling them how to
read the visualization. Again, we're introducing
this notion of ambiguity. So if they're choosing
the wrong interpretation, be it surface area or volume, they're going to get
the wrong things. Even if it was properly labeled, they're probably still
not going to be able to separate out
this different idea of the encoding from the reality
of the visual which is that it looks like an object, a 3D object and they understand
how 3D objects work. So even if it was
properly labeled, they might not do
the right thing. So again, we have this notion of Stevens' Law in length,
area, and volume, being the ways in which
we would prefer in order to encode data length being the best than
area than volume. So we would choose if we can to most accurately
represent things using length and keep length as a consistent thing where actual to perceive is perfect
indicating a Lie Factor of one. So avoid if possible using area
and volume here. Now, where might we care
about actually fudging a little bit and not encoding data with a Lie Factor of one. So one example is
in a map like this. Often, map makers like to use symbols to represent
a different pieces of the data. So something like a circle
overlaid on top of a map to represent population counts
or hopes or whatever it is. So here we talked about
this before when we have absolute scaling of areas,
people misinterpret them. So they don't read
it in the right way. So 1, to 3, to 6, to 12, is not actually read
correctly because people can't decode areas correctly, which is why we
introduced this notion of Flannery's compensation which basically
fudges a little bit. So the 12 becomes
a little bit bigger, the six also a little bit
bigger and so on, basically to
correspond to the way human beings actually read the data when they look at this. So the area we're trying to
get it so that it looks more perfect than it actually is by increasing the perception by making the circles
a little bit bigger. This is a situation where if we thought that
this was appropriate, we actually might
want to introduce a Lie Factor into
this discussion. So a Lie Factor of
one might not be the appropriate thing
if we were trying to get people to read
the circles correctly. So we will avoid these things if possible but sometimes we can't. So the takeaways;
Thou shall not lie is a perfectly reasonable
place to start, and the Lie Factor reflects how much of a mismatch there is
between the real and false. So it gives you
a sense of how much of a lie there is in
the visualization, and you can use that in
your visualizations, when you're making
weird adaptations to the visual to figure out whether you're doing
the right thing or not. But the caveat is
that some designs actually lie because
of visual limits. So if we have to use
things like circles for areas or volumes and so on, we might actually introduce a Lie Factor a little bit
because we have to compensate for the poor reading of humans in their perception. With that, thank
you for listening.
