Hi, welcome back. We're
going to continue on our Adventure 3 design
and I want to talk a little bit about this idea
of wicked design. Information visualization
as a wicked design problem. In many cases what you'll
find when you're looking at really simple visualization
tasks is you can solve them directly with
just a simple bar chart or a line chart or
whatever it is. But in many of the more
sophisticated examples that you'll build or see, you're going to have to make
lots and lots of trade offs, because there aren't going to be many many tasks that you need
to support simultaneously, and you can't always
actually achieve that all at the
same visualization, so this is this notion of
a wicked design problem. A wicked design problem
is one in which it is difficult or impossible to
solve the problem completely, you're going to have to
make some trade-offs. So you'd have
incomplete information, sometimes you're going to
have contradictory needs, some people are going
to want something, some people are going to want something else or you're going to be restricted in
the information that you get. There are always going to
be changing requirements, so over time the tasks
that people might have when using your visualization
are going to change, and whether that's at
the individual level or at the group level, you have to take that
into consideration, but that's what makes
this so wicked design problem. Any solution that
you create will go away over time or
evolve over time. So there are
six main characteristics of a wicked design problem. The first is that
you don't understand the problem until you have
developed a solution. We'll come back to
this, we'll bookend in this discussion with
a similar point. But basically you've
been given a data and maybe some questions and insights and you have to
develop a solution. But until you actually
build something, you have no alternative, so you have nothing to
compare it against. So you're going to have to
build a few different options basically to understand
the best way to do it. With information
visualization specifically, you really need to actually
put the data on the screen in a visualization to understand the best way to represent it. The second thing is there's
no stopping rule to making developments in improving
your visualization, so this is a nice example from researchers describing
the design process. What you can see is
all these arrows swinging back in every step, because you can learn you
can basically try and identify tasks, you
can discover things, and this is all you're
talking to other analysts, you're talking to
potential clients, and they basically have
new information all the time, and as you give them
solutions they might say, "Oh, we have to go
back and fix things." So you see this constant arrows
going back at every step, because at every point, we want to be able
to go back and make changes based on what we learned, and there is no stopping rule, there is no thing that says, "Stop now," other than
running out of time. Solutions in the case of wicked design problems are
often not right or wrong, so there's not just a
purely correct solution, this is not like
a homework assignment where there is a right answer
and a wrong answer. But we can still talk about
things being better or worse. So I want to give
some examples in a second, but when you think
about comparing even the two numbers as we've seen in a few of
the other lectures, there's a very simple bar chart, but there's other ways of
comparing the numbers 12 and 7. We saw lots of
different examples, some of which are appropriate for certain tasks and not for others. So let me give you
a real example. So this is from a set
of visualizations, actually put out by the same newspaper The New York Times, where they want to rank countries based on the number
of Olympic medals. So they want an absolute score that basically says this
is the best country, this is the worst
countries, and so on, listed on the screen, and they need some way
of representing that. Now the problem is, there's
questions like what's a gold worth relative to
something like a silver? Like how do we add up the medals? Should everything count the same? There are other questions like should we take into account, how big the country is or how much income
the country has, like what's the GDP? All these things are interesting
questions but they might restrict our
visualization choices, and depending on what
we want to focus on, we will do different things
in the visualization. So I will show you two vastly
different examples that all support the same
high level question but different sub-questions. So this is a very
clever example that The New York Times developed
around the Winter Olympics. What they were showing here
is a trade-off between how much gold medals
and silver medals are worth relative to bronze medals and how that might
change the ranking. So it turns out that when
all medals are valued equally or we only care about gold medals
Norway always wins. So that's why you see one
solid color for Norway, and it doesn't really matter. As I'm brushing
over, you're going to see this list changing, because the other countries will depend on how you value
some of these other things. So Germany is always
in second place, Canada is always in third, the US is always in forth, Netherlands is always in fifth. But when we get to South Korea, we start to see
something interesting which is that there's a trade-off between how much we value these different medals. So gold medals and silver
medals and bronze medals all being worth the same as
this bottom left corner, but as we drift over to this side where these other medals
don't really matter, we see that South Korea
moves from sixth to seventh. Some of the countries
are actually really fragile when you do this. So you can see these are the Olympic athletes from Russia, you can see as we move from this display over
all these different regions, the ranking actually
changes quite dramatically all the way
from sixth down to 13th, depending on how you
value different medals. So this is one example of trying to answer
the question of which is the best country or what's
the relative ranking of countries based on the number
of medals they've won? So here's a vastly
different example. This time they're
focusing on changes in time and also adjusting for
things like population. So you can see here that the United States
dominates over China, this Summer Olympics
instead of Winter Olympics. So you see where
these different countries rank and how they dominate
the other countries. So you see when countries
are equivalent, they're sitting at
the same level. The interesting thing
about this visualization is it allows you to
compare over time. So by clicking on 2008
or going back to 2012, you can see how
the rankings change, and you can do things like
adjusting for population. So in this case,
the authors felt like it was important to adjust
for population counts, which is perhaps a
reasonable given that the US and China
are quite large. If you do that, you see the United States and
China falling dramatically and smaller countries that are winning more than you
would expect like Grenade, Bahamas Jamaica, dominating in these rankings once we
adjust for population. So depending on which version
of reality you want, which version of
the best country you want, whether it should be
based on population, time or other factors like the values of gold versus bronze versus
silver medals, you're going to pick
a very different kind of encoding and a very different kind
of visualization that emphasizes
these different things. So we saw from this example
that there are many cases where the solution
is neither right nor wrong. We saw two equally
good visualizations, but they can be treated better or worse depending on
the kind of tasks. So whether we were
focusing on time or we were focusing on some
other attribute of the data, different solutions
were better or worse. To other interesting things
about wicked design problems. Each is essentially
a unique and novel. Once you've created one, they may not work for
any other piece of data or any other time
point in history. Every solution is often
a one shot operation. That is, you're
building this and you may have to throw it away because it might not work ever
again the entire solution. Now, when we focus on information visualization and we look at other people's
visualizations, we will try and understand
their choices in building the visualization and
hopefully be able to integrate some of those into
our future visualization. So being able to find interesting encodings
and using those, that's going to be a key, but with wicked design
we often have to throw away the actual solution
like the complete thing. So here's an example
that basically, because of the different
data questions and contexts which creates
this vast space of choices, we have one solution
that we've built for that particular point
in time that context that we're going to have
to throw away if we try and build some similar thing
in a later time point. So this is another example from the New York Times that
supports this point. It was from the election when Obama was running against Romney, and you saw different ways
in this visualization, where Obama can
win versus Romney. So you can see here, there are
431 ways for Obama to win, 76 for Romney, and five ways
to do a tie in this tree, which is basically forced
using whatever they understood about
the election at the time that Florida was
a key determinant, and then Ohio, then
North Carolina, and so on. These were going
to be key states. So for this particular election, Obama and Romney are unique as are the different
kinds of states, as are the different kinds of polling data they've collected. The visualization was
interesting in that it lets you explore different pathways
through this, based on who was going to win what and what the outcome
was going to be. So if Romney won Florida then
Ohio then North Carolina, Obama could still win
a number of these cases. So this tree allowed
you to explore it. Now, the tree itself is something we can use
in a future election, but the particular levels and
the encoding of the tree, that was unique to
this particular point and time, this particular election, this particular data that
they've collected. So just to bookend
this conversation, I want to emphasize the fact
that this last point, there is no given
alternative solution often when we talk about
wicked design problems. There might be ideas
that we can use, like the idea of a tree
or some specific charts or encodings or
interaction techniques that we can borrow, but there might not be a complete solution
to the problem. So there's no alternative that we can compare ourselves to. That would make life
easier for ourselves, we can say this is
better than this, but we often have to
be the ones creating the different alternatives in designing these solutions
to wicked design problems. So we would still like to know that we're heading in
the right direction, and this is what a lot of the conversation around
some of the design ideas, some of the design suggestions that we'll see will lead us to. So to put it another way,
we still want to make sure that all the pieces can
fit as well as we can. Often that will
require understanding within that particular contexts
whether the pieces fit, but we're trying to find
more general rules if we can that will guide us
and help us along the way. So the takeaways are
that information visualization is broadly a wicked
design problem, and this comes about
with more complexity. So very simple infovis, might not have this property, but the more sophisticated
information visualizations that we built are
going to have this. The properties of
wicked design problems make it hard to build something
that is absolutely perfect, but we are working
towards better, so we can do that certainly. We can still borrow ideas that we see in to the new designs
that we built.
