So welcome back to
perception and cognition. I want to show you how
pre-attentive perception can be used in action and
building a visualization. So if we look at our pile of puzzle pieces and think about domain abstraction technique
and algorithm. Let's say, I give you
a specific problem like I have this dataset that has
a category like A, B, D and so on and it has two quantitative variables
associated with it. The task that I have
in mind is being able to find sets
of related points. So very easily, being able to see where all
the A points are, the B points, and
the D points are. Can we do that very quickly? So what technique
are we going to use? In particular, is there pre-attentive technique that we can use to make this work? The one I'm going to
suggest is quite simple. We're going to take
our quantitative variable. We're going to encode that
using numeric encoding. Quantitative 2, again numeric. The category is
a nominal variable in our language of visualization. We're going to map
quantitative 1. We have to pick
a specific retinal variable. So in this case, we're going
to pick the x position. Quantitative tool, we're
going to pick the y position. This again is in
our grammar of graphics. Category here we're
going to pick color. The mark will be a point. So a specific kind
of a dot or shape will be the way that
we encode this. We can make this a little bit more pre-attentive actually, by both varying the color and the shape of the
categorical variables. So you're going to see
this in the example. This will make for an interesting pre-attentive
visualization. So we have our abstract task, which is finding sets
of related points. The specific techniques
that we're going to use is a scatter plot with points encoded using shapes and colors. So this is our visualization. That is the output of this particular grammar
of graphics. So you see these three
different years, this corresponds to
the A, B, and D points. We have these two
different quantitative variables that we had in mind. In this case, it's car weight in pounds and miles per gallon. The really cool thing about
this is that it's possible to pre-attentively pick out the fact that there are these three
different kinds of shapes, and be able to determine
where they are on the screen and be able to
focus our attention on any particular year. So if I say focus on 1982, you'd be able to do this quickly. If I say focus on 1976, you'd be able to do this quickly. So these are things
that we can do pre-attentively now that we've chosen this particular encoding. These things that we care about, these different categories become things that pop out through
pre-attentive encoding. So this technique is
effective because again, we can pick out our targets using pre-attentive processing. The takeaways for this is
that it's easy to find salient features on the data if we use pre-attentive
processing. If we are strategic about it, we can use it in
design to really help our visualizations when we need to make something pop out. All right, thank
you for listening.
