Welcome back to
our discussion around design. What I want to focus on now is the notion of data-ink ratio. You'll see this as
another thing from Edward Tufte that
pushed extensively, but what I actually want
to do in this set of slides is walk you
through the argument, but also why it's not really supported
and why it might be an aesthetic choice and less so about expressiveness
and effectiveness. So it's important for us to
understand where this comes from because a lot of books
will push for this idea, but I want to push back
on it a little bit and explain how it actually works and where it makes
sense and where it doesn't. So Tufte has two specific rules and I'll explain both
of them in a second. Thou shalt maximize
the data-ink ratio and thou shalt maximize
the data-density. So let's go through each of these to understand how they work. The first is this notion
of data-ink ratio. So the question is
I'm thinking about how much ink or
how much toner you would have to use in order
to print something. You can think about whether
that ink is being wasted. So how much of the actual
ink that we used to print the graphic was
actually important? So if we have a visualization
like a bunch of bar charts, the thing on the left here, we can ask the question, have we used more ink than
we actually needed to? Ideally, we're going to use only ink for things that
actually encode data. So the Tufte notion around
this is that one should eliminate things that are unimportant from
the visualization, so redundant information
should be eliminated. So if we have the Bar
chart visualization on the left over here, so each of these is
like a mini bar chart; you have two different bars corresponding to
each and so each of these grid cells is a different kind of comparison that we might want to make. So what Tufte said
is that you can take those visualization
over here and subtract out this ink that you're basically not using for
anything useful and remove it. Why do you need this extra
stuff if all you're trying to communicate is this
information on the right. So you can go from
this little bar chart over here to this little
bar chart over here. It's equally expressive
in the notion of Tufte, and his argument is that it is actually more
effective because you've eliminated things that are
cognitively inefficient. So when your eye is scanning
from the left to the right, for example when you're trying
to compare the different, let me get a different color, you're trying to
compare different bars like these two bars, it's easier to do that
if you don't have all these distracting
boxes in the way, and all this extra
information, like these stars. Why is that
information necessary? It's clear which bar is bigger, which is what the star
is indicating, why do I need that star? It's also clear to read
from this line over here, how much different this
line is from this line. You have the axes,
those still exist, you have the zero line down here. So why do you need
all this extra stuff down here? You can just throw
all those extra things away and end up with a much cleaner base line
that connects the bars, that lets you read it in
a much more effective way. So this is the idea of
improving this data-ink ratio. So how do we do this?
Above all else, Tufte says, "Show the data." This is reasonable. If we
lose anything of the data, it's not as expressive anymore, then we've done something wrong. We want to then engage in this repeated thing of
maximizing the data-ink ratio. So erase non-data-ink, things that are not conveying
actual information. So this star at the top which is telling us which bar
is taller or not, we don't need that anymore,
so let's get rid of that. We also want to erase
redundant data ink. So when we're looking at the different bar
chart over here, like these boxes,
why represent it as a box when we can simply
represent it as a line? So that is the notion of
erasing redundant data-ink. Once we've done that, we should look at our
visualization and decide if we can keep going like we can keep
eliminating stuff. So if we do this iteratively, we should be able to arrive at a very nice visualization that is minimalist in the sense of data-ink ratio and has
equal expressiveness and is perhaps more effective because it doesn't have all this other
distracting information. Now, how does this actually work? If we apply this
to its end state, does this actually make sense? So let's say we have a bunch of tasks that we're
trying to support, we have a bunch of comparisons, and so we have
these different options. So we have option one, which is low data-ink ratio and option two which is
high data-ink ratio. Our preference, in theory, would be that we should
prefer the one on the right because it is
equally as expressive, but it is actually more effective because we don't have all
this distracting information. So let's do this for
a different visualization. Let's take this boxplot
for example. So we have a bunch of
box and whisker plots sitting next to each other, do we need to use
all this stuff on the screen in order
to encode this data? Couldn't we reduce some of these lines and
throw them away? The answer is, of
course, yes we can. So let's instead of
having lines over here, let me start drawing
a little bit. We have these lines
representing the median, we have these extremes
of the whiskers, we have the end points over here. So those are the key points, basically, in the visualization. So let's throw
all that stuff away and just encode
the data using this. So we're going to have
a dot now where the median, and the line starts where the top of the box started up to
the top of the whisker, and another line from the bottom. Show this in a different color. Another line down here going
to the bottom over here. So this is the same data. You can see I switch
back and forth. We basically have
the same data being encoded in a much simpler form. Looking at this, we've done
one step, let's keep going. Using Tufte's rules, we can
still throw some stuff away. Why don't we throw away
the lines and use a much simpler representation?Why
don't we just do it like this, where the tops and the bottoms
are represented using these little triangles indicating
which direction to go. A lot less ink being used,
same expressiveness. Arguably, this is starting to be a little bit less effective. This becomes a little bit
more difficult to read. So blindly applying Tufte's rule here is going to result in something that looks
perhaps like this, which is not actually
very readable. It's very minimalist, but
it's not very readable. Even if I teach you
how to read it, you still might
find it challenging because it's difficult, it's very hard to track over
these large, white spaces. Here's a smaller example
where we've manipulated color to bring back some of
the effectiveness, but again, we're going to have
these problems of readability because the lines that allow the eye to trace from the top to
the bottom are gone. So let's go back to
this intermediate point. So maybe there's this notion
of going too far. So Tufte's algorithm
does not actually tell us when we've gone too far. Maybe we have to have some sense
of that aesthetically. So this in Tufte's view
is where you should stop. You shouldn't go beyond this. Now, does this still work? Is this still a better solution? Not so much. People have actually tried to
analyze this idea. So what they did was they
looked at a bunch of different implementations
of box and whisker plots. So you have the original one in this panel, one at the top. So this is the
traditional box plot. You have the schematic
plot just a little bit using less ink for the line. You have a line plot over here where the box is eliminated, and then there is
mid-gap plot which is the version that
we've been playing with the Tufte is encouraged.
So they tested this. They basically said
how accurately can people read these
different visualizations. They encoded a bunch
of fake data, they put it in front of people, and they ask them
a bunch of questions. So it turns out that the boxplot and line
plot are actually much better and give
much more accurate estimates than the mid-gap plot. Let me pull this up. So this is the line
representing mid-gap, and you can see this is
more inaccurate going up. So you can see that
the mid-gap when the interquartile that is the range here isn't
the number of millimeters. You can see that performance with the mid-gap is much
worse than line and box, and even over here at
this extreme when they're close, mid-gap actually performs worse than the line and the box. It gives this idea that one should prefer this
visualization down here to the traditional box plot up here is perhaps
not even accurate. So we have to be
very careful when we apply the strategy of this data ink
ratio transformation in actual visualization because in terms of perception
and psychology, it might not actually
be the right thing. The other thing that Tufte pushes for is this notion
of data density. So the data density is
a way of thinking about the number of entries in our original table in
our original data table. So if you think about
the spreadsheet, you were given it had a bunch of columns and a bunch of rows, and you think about
how many different kinds of comparisons one could make
when given the raw data, and then you ask
when I've expressed that data in a graphic, how many of those comparisons can actually still be supported? So ideally, if we have lots of entries in
the data matrix, we should be able to
maximize and have lots and lots of
different comparisons possible given our choice of
size for the data graphic. So if we were limited to this much area in
the data graphic, what we actually want to make
sure is that we're using all the space that we can
for the visualization. We don't want to just
have one visualization in here when we can have four or more to support lots and lots
of different comparisons. So this is Tufte's favorite
example that reflects this as Menard's map of the march of Napoleon's army
to Russia and back. Its encoding lots and
lots of different things. So you see the size of the army
in the height of the bar, and so this is how many people
were alive in the army. You see them march
from France to Russia, and you see the march back, so encoded in color, and at the bottom over here, this line reflects
the temperature. So you see people dying
as a partial explanation. So as the army was marching back, you see in certain key points people were dying as
the temperature drops. So the army was facing some challenges
because of temperature as it was retreating. Lots of different comparisons
are possible here. You see the march geographically, you see the size of the army, you see some explanation through the temperature encoding. All these things are being pushed in this particular
visualization, and so you get lots of things in here simultaneously
and it's great. Now, pushing this to an extreme, here's something called
a matrix scatter plot. It has lots and lots
of data being encoded, there's lots of
comparisons being made, but arguably this is becoming a little bit difficult to read. So there's a lot of
stuff being encoded here and lots of different
data cells in comparisons. But this becomes a little bit
more challenging to read just in
this particular form. So this might be
an extreme example, whereas this is maybe reasonable, this is extreme, and so
we might not want to go quite as far as this
in many situations. So there's a number of
questions that we're going to have to ask ourselves
when we do this. So we are going to think about the different domain tasks
that we want to support. We're going to have
to think about the abstract version of
those tasks look like. Then we're going to try and
come up with the simplest, cleanest representation possible that still
has all the data. With a caveat again that sometimes simplest and cleanest
is an aesthetic choice rather than one that's based
in actual psychological, or cognitive, or
perceptual evidence, and so we have to be
careful about applying this brush of erasing, this eraser I guess of erasing different things or
adding more elements to the visualization
without thinking through what it actually
means for the tasks. So the caveats to consider
like a way of thinking about this is that Tufte comes from what's known as the
cognitive efficiency school, where it's really important for the person to be able to decode as accurately as possible. Now, even being in that
cognitive efficiency school, he's still made some mistakes
and the recommendations, but that is the basis of a lot of the things that he's offered
as design suggestions. The other caveat is that
Tufte is a minimalist, and so he produces
art like he has an art practice and he produces sculptures
that look like this, or like this and they're
very minimalist, they have a certain
aesthetic property to them and that has been
applied in the way he's chosen to build
his visualizations or recommendations
around visualization. So the takeaway is
there that supporting many comparisons is probably a good idea when
the tasks calls for it. So thinking about what
you want to support, but that minimalism has an aesthetic choice
in a lot of cases, and data ink and data
density are driven ideas, are not all validated
experimentally. So don't take
everything that people say in terms of throwing away certain pieces of ink or putting in lots of visualizations all into the same display or actually validated through
some experimental practice. So these are good things
to think about, the idea of high data ink
or data density but not always great to apply. With that, thank
you for listening.
