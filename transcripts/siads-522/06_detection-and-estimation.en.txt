Welcome back to
perception and cognition. I want to talk right now about
detection and estimation. Particularly when we're good and when we're bad at
these different tasks. The first thing that I
want to talk about is this notion of
just-noticeable difference. That is where we can detect that two
things are different. We saw an example with
these gray squares before where it was possible to detect them when there was
a difference that was huge. So if asked you which was lighter depending on
the specific shades, there were situations where
you were able to tell me that they were different and
situations where you are not. This happens to work across all the
different senses actually. So if we think
about if we were to touch a fingertip or the hand
using two different points, depending on how close
those points are, we would not be
able to distinguish those as being different. So if we move this caliper
down here and move it closer, you wouldn't be able
to tell that there was a difference because
the neurons that you have, your touch sensors in that particular area of
the hand aren't that great. So the closer we
move this caliper, the harder it becomes to tell that I'm touching
two different points. This is the notion of just noticeable difference
and it applies both senses like touch
and senses like vision. The thing that tells
us how this works or determines what the
just noticeable differences is, is related to this idea
called Weber's Law. Weber's Law is
this specific formula and what it has is a constant, this K. It has the
intensity that is how much we feel a particular
thing and the Delta, the change in intensity
that we need to be able to perceive in order to say
that something is different. So how does this work? Let's say, we have a room in
which people are whispering and we know
that the constant K, let's say, for sound is one. So if the room is
very very quiet, this intensity too
is very, very low. The amount that we have to
increase that intensity to be able to tell that there's
a change is only two. So that is Delta two over two is one so that we're
maintaining the constant. So if we're in a very different
room where it's very loud we again have to maintain
this constant of one. Our intensity now is at
100. We're very loud. In order for the difference
to be detectable, now we have to increase
our intensity by 100. So instead of increasing it by just a little bit in
the really quiet room, we have to be really loud for someone to be able to
detect that difference. So this is part of the
things that constrain us when we think about
just-noticeable difference, this constant and what the relative intensity is of that signal whether
it is the color, whether it is the sound. So we're going to
consider this when thinking about
just noticeable differences. Most continuous data because of this is actually
perceived discretely. So if we look at this gradient and if you focus on the particular
things in the gradient, what most people will see
if they stare at it for a while is that it will look like they're actually
bands to them. It will be very
difficult to detect all the different shades of
gray in this visualization. What you'll see is again, these bands because
there will be periods, the places in the
particular visualization that you won't be able to
detect the difference. So let's move on to this
interesting idea of estimation. This is a slightly different
concept, but highly related. If I show you
these two circles on the screen and I
asked you to tell me how much different in area the bigger circle is
relative to that little one, this is actually hard
for a lot of people. Some people will
say it's two times. Some people will say
it's three times. Some people will
say it six times. The reality is it's
four times and most people are unable
to do this accurately. This has to do with something
called Steven's power law. This is a different law again, like Weber's Law that tells us about the way we
perceive things. The equation for Steven's power law is
a little bit different. We have intensity, we have
sensation, and we have power. What people have done is
these different experiments to figure out for
different senses, for different kinds of
signals what that power should be and for different kinds of things
whether brightness, smell, area, length, and so on, we have a very different piece. So how does this work? We have the actual signal
and the perceived signal. So if I draw a line of different, or I draw multiple lines
on the screen of different lengths what
is true for length is that your actual length is pretty accurate when I asked you to tell me how long it is. So the actual length relates nearly one-to-one with
perceived length. So there's a perfect correlation between these two things. So if I take this line and it has a unit length of one and
I ask you how long it is, most people are able
to tell me quite accurately perceive this
as a length of one. So they're able to say, "It's one." That's great. This is exactly what
we want and even more important when it comes to visualization is in comparison. So if I asked you how much longer one line
is relative to the other you're able to answer this accurately again and say
it's two times as long. So length has
this perfect relationship between the actual signal
and perceived signal. This is great for us when we
can use it in visualization. Now, it turns out that area is actually a little bit
different and worse. With the actual and
perceived are not a perfect correlation and it's actually much worse when
we think about volume. So people tend to actually
underestimate when asked about area and volume in terms of what the signal actually is. So if I say, "What's
the area of the circle?" It happens to have
a true area one, the reported areas is 0.7. If I asked you to tell me
what the volume is of this one cubic whatever volume sphere, most people reported as 0.6. So there's a little bit of
an underestimate that happens. There's not this great perfect correlation as
we see with length. That is why we're
are going to prefer length when we're using this retinal variable to encode data in our visualizations. We prefer not to use area and
volume if we can avoid it. We can't always avoid it
and you've probably seen visualizations that
looks something like this. This is a map. This might be election data
or whatever it is and we're encoding particular pieces of
information using circles. What we're asking the viewer
to be able to do is look at the circles and figure out what the area is and be able
to estimate these things. This is really, really hard, but in this particular case, it was necessary given
the particular choices. So what have people done? People have started thinking
about ways of doing this, in particular, in map-making. If we have a notion of
this one unit circle and this is absolutely scaling and then we're going
to triple in size. So this is perfectly accurate. The area of this larger circle is three times the area
of the smaller circle, then we're going to 6,
then we're going to 12. Now, knowing that people underestimate these
differences- so if ask you, how much bigger the three is than the one and I don't
give you the texts, you're going to underestimate. So what people have done is applied this kind of correction, which is called
Flannery's compensation. Where they make the circles just a little bit
bigger in order to fool the eye into seeing
what the actual scaling is, using this apparent
scaling notion. So if we overlay, you can see that
the 12 is bigger, the red 6 behind the
blue 6 is bigger, and the 3 is bigger as well. So we're fooling the eye. As you might imagine, this
comes with some cost. If someone is good at this task or someone
is aware that they're bad at estimating areas and we apply Flannery's compensation, then they're going to
read the wrong thing. They're going to see something bigger than it actually is. So this is the idea
that you can make corrections for these problems that we see with Steven's law, but you have to use them with caution because we're lying
essentially with the data, a little bit with
the visualization. The takeaways from
this particular segment is that there are
perceptual limits, things like
just-noticeable difference and as we're informed
by Weber's Law, that limit our ability to
determine differences. We also learn that
input signal does not necessarily equal perception and this is Steven's law
and this will impact the accuracy of
our reading of data. We can correct for
some of these things, but they should be
used cautiously. So thanks for listening.
