Welcome to Information
Visualization. I wanted to briefly
just talk about what the course goals
are for this class. We're going to do
a lot of things over the next four weeks and many
many small video lectures. So you're going to learn
quite a few things. But I just wanted to cover the main high-level goals that we have in terms of what our objectives are for you to be able to do when you're done. So one of the things that
we want to to be able to do is learn how to create
information visualization. So we're going to
teach you how to use different pieces of
software to do this, but also to understand the underlying
psychological, cognitive, perceptual rules that
basically allow you to create good information
visualizations. We'll teach you how to critique information visualization. So looking at other
people's visualizations, whether they be for
communicative purposes or a tool that somebody
is providing you, you'll learn how to critique it based on some of
these underlying principles. So you'll learn
design principles, you'll learn specific aspects of what makes for good
visualizations and bad ones, and be able to provide good critique for
visualizations that you see. The last thing is I
want you to be able to evaluate
visualization systems, and a lot of cases
what you're going to have is somebody dumps a piece of software on your lap where
you're going to have multiple pieces of software that you need to decide between. So the question for you
will be how to know which particular piece
of software would be better or worse for
the tests that you have. So some of the things
that we will teach you in this course will
allow you to do that, by basically understanding
the underlying again, perceptual and cognitive
and design rules. So you'll be able to better pick and choose
from those things. Having seen other
people's visualizations, you'll also be able to take some of the ideas that
you've learned about and be able to integrate them into new visualizations
that you build. So we'll be doing some
of this but this is not a course about building
very simple visualizations, like bar charts and
things like that. You'll learn why they work. You'll learn how to
integrate them into other kinds of visualizations
broader things. You'll build some dashboards. You'll build some more
sophisticated visualizations, either intended for
communication or for analysis. We'll explain why things
like a bar chart works. But we won't focus
on this as much. So we will start to develop a better sense of why
visualizations like this work, where things like color and shape will make the visualization
better or worse. We'll also think about tools and where they're
appropriate or not. So this is a tool called
Tableau which is very popular and used in business analytics and
in other settings. It's a very powerful tool which will do a lot of things for you, not everything but a lot
of things for you. But we still need to
have some sense of the underlying rules that Tableau uses as well as the things
that are within our control. So there are choices
that we have to make when using tools
like this that are again somewhat automated but you'll still have to
make some choices and that will be important to understand your options
and why they matter. We won't do as much in
this particular set of lectures but you will
get to the point where you're able to look at very sophisticated
visualizations that do all kinds of weird things like visualization
on top of text. So this is a
visualization intended to convey something about poetry. So there's different kinds
of lines and things that are tracking the flow, the rhyming and so on within
this piece of poetry. We'll start to think about the different techniques
that they use to encode this data which will
become handy as you build more and more
sophisticated visualizations. While we won't build
things like this, you will start to be able
to think about how to integrate different pieces
of visualizations. So different kinds of smaller
charts into a bigger whole that will allow you to do much more sophisticated analysis
than just one of these. So a simple bar chart
or a simple tree or whatever it is will only be useful for a limited
set of tasks. We're going to start
to think about how to integrate all these things together to support
visualization. Later on, as you go through additional classes
on visualization, you'll learn more about
interaction and so on. But we'll cover
a little bit of that. The things that basically
will allow you to bind these different visualizations together to make them useful. We'll also offer you some tools to compare
visualizations. These are five different systems that all essentially support the same kind of
data analysis and this case it's around genetic data. So this is something
called microarray data. So you take cells and you basically wash them
across this microarray, it's called a gene
chip and then you analyze what's happening
within that gene. There are different kinds
of tools that will support different tasks
within that dataset. How would you pick between these? Like which ones are
better or worse? What makes them better or worse? These are the kinds of tools
that we will give you in this semester or
this set of lectures. What we will teach you all to do is to avoid really bad designs. So things like this. We will
teach you how not to do and why these are
generally a bad idea. So you may have heard
of this. You may have a sense of this already but there are actually perceptual reasons
why they're bad. So we will cover some
of that as well. With that thank
you for listening.
