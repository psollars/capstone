Welcome back to perception and cognition. We're going to talk, right now, about a really interesting phenomenon
called preattentive processing. If I show you this visual, and I asked you
to find all the number threes in here, this is going to be something that
actually takes you a long time. You're going to have to scan through all
the different numbers trying to find the number three. Now, let me do something, a really simple
trick that will leverage preattentive processing to make this
problem actually easy for you. Now find the number threes. This has become really easy because I've
distinguished the number threes using a color, specifically red, so that it's
pulled out and becomes preattentive. That is, you're able to look at it and not really read through
all the different numbers. But you're able to see all the number
threes instantly using this notion of preattentive processing. Preattentive processing is the phenomenon
that we have where basically we can do something without focusing our
attention on any particular thing. And we can do this in
about ten milliseconds. Non-preattentive tasks take
more than 40 milliseconds. That is, you have to pay attention and
think about it in some way. And muscle movement, so if you think about
having to move your head or your eyes, those can take up to 200 milliseconds. So we're talking about
ten milliseconds for being able to digest a piece
of information on the screen. This is quite powerful if we can use it. So we're relying on low level vision
system in parallel to be able to do this. It includes tasks like boundary detection,
region tracking, counting and estimation, surprisingly,
can also be preattentive. But I'll show you a few specific
examples that are simple and representative of what we think about when
we think about preattentive processing. So I'm going to flicker a few images
on the screen really quickly. There's going to be two of them. And what I'd like for
you to look at is the images and see if you can detect a red
circle in each of the images. So there's going to be two and
they're going to flicker quite quickly. So take a look. Okay, so what did you see? Probably in the first one, most of you recognize that there was
no red circle in the sea of blue. And in the second image that you saw,
you were able to detect the red circle. Hue, the color, is a preattentive signal. So something that we can
detect quite rapidly and it will turn out that no matter how many
blue circles we have, how many or how few, we're able to do this nearly instantly. So here's another example, pay attention. Okay, that one may have been
a little bit harder for some of you. But most people are still able
to do this nearly instantly. To recognize that the first image had no
red circle and the second image, again, had a red circle. So shape is another thing that we
can count on for being preattentive. Okay, one last one, pay attention. So this one is actually hard. Okay, this is conjunction. There are two different things that
we're varying, both the shape and color. In the first one, there's no red circle. In the second one,
if we look down in the corner over here, you might be able to find it
now as you're scanning through. Conjunctions are not preattentive. So when we have distractors that
are varying around a bunch of different parameters, then it becomes very difficult
for us to do this preattentively be able to process things in parallel and
nearly instantly. Things that are preattentive have been
studied quite intensely in a number of different scenarios. Things like shape, things like length,
width, enclosure, curvature, and number are things that are preattentive. So in all of these little images, you should be able to detect
the thing that is different. And you should be able to do that nearly
instantly without scanning through or thinking about it much. There's quite a large collection of these. And these have been collected over a long
period by people doing different kinds of experiments to figure this out. You might think that we've discovered all
the different ways that we can make things preattentive already. But it turns out that with new
technology we're discovering new and clever ways to make things preattentive. So here's an interesting example. Let's say we have this dot that
we want to make preattentive. So this dot over here we want to be
able to make it sort of come out and the viewer to be able to quickly see that. So you can see that on the image
on the left it appears, on the image on the right it does not. What people have done is
taken those two images and fed them to the different eyes
using 3D glass technology. So looking at a visualization, using one
of these glasses, oddly the image that is missing from the one, but visible
in the other, will become preattentive. So this is called the dead eye technique. And it's really subtle, but
very interesting that you can detect these things nearly instantly
when looking at the visualization. Now in most cases,
preattentiveness is symmetric. So if I make the curve go one way or
the other, it doesn't really matter. So as long as there's one thing that
the signal is very different from the distractor, it doesn't matter if
it's red among blue or blue among red. These things are often symmetric. There are some asymmetries, but
there's experiments that have shown that those asymmetries are often
due to bad experiments. And so we have to be careful about how
we think about them when someone says preattentiveness is asymmetric. Most preattentive processing is symmetric. That's the thing to remember. Now, there's two other things that I want
to talk about very briefly as caveats, distractors and conjunctions. Distractors are this notion of how
much other information we can have on the screen relative to the thing
that we want people to see. So if we want to see the red
dot in the sea of blue, we can think about the blue
dots as being distractors. Now, it turns out that for
preattentive things, it doesn't matter how
many blue dots we have. So whether we have 10 or 25 or 50, okay,
these things are all preattentive. So it doesn't actually matter
to us when we're looking. So we have what is basically a flat line
across all the number of distractors, whether we have 10, 25, 50, or 100. We're able to instantly,
this is the response time, be able to determine that the signal
that we care about is on the screen. If it was not preattentive, and we had to
scan across to be able to determine this, we would see a curve that looks
something like this, okay. So as the number of distractors increases,
we would have to spend more time scanning through the visualization trying to
find the signal that we care about. So this is how we distinguish between
preattentive and non-preattentive. The other thing that I want to bring
up is this notion of conjunctions. As we saw in the example where we had
red and blue circles and squares, most things that are conjunctions
are not preattentive. So if I give you a visualization and I ask
you to find the grey ellipse where I am varying both the shape and the color
in this particular visualization, this might take a little
bit of time to do. This is a little bit trickier,
you might have to scan through. This is usually not preattentive and
especially if you have lots and lots of distractors. Now we can make this preattentive by,
basically, varying the placement of things. So if I divide the image on the left
into these two images on the right, they still have the same
amount of data on them. It's much easier to
detect the gray ellipse, which is down in this corner over here. Okay, because it is surrounded by
a bunch of distractors that are quite different, okay. So this is something that we
can do to take non-preattentive information that's a conjunction and
make it preattentive. So most, as I said,
most conjunctions are not preattentive. There are some spatial conjunctions
that work where you're varying things in space and placement that you can
rely on to make things preattentive. The takeaways for this is that preattentive processing
can basically support pop-ups. The ability to determine that there is
an interesting signal in the noise of the data that we're looking at. And we're going to rely on this
when building visualizations. They work independent of distractors. So no matter how many distractors we have,
we're able to do this quite well. But conjunctions are important
because they'll break our features. And we will see conjunctions often because
real visualizations will rely on multiple signals. We're not going to just use one specific
thing, like just color and shape, but we're going to vary
things in multiple ways. So we're going to have to worry
about this in real situations. With that, thanks for listening.
