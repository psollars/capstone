Welcome back to our lectures
about data models. I want to introduce you
to a couple of concepts. One which we've talked
about a little bit before. In another lecture,
expressiveness and another concept called
effectiveness These are going to be two terms
that are going to be used often in the way we will make decisions about whether
a visualization is good or not and how we'll evaluate
those visualizations. So expressiveness
and effectiveness are going to drive
a lot of what we do. They're going to be
the thing that help us understand whether we've made
the right set of choices. So given the data and the tasks, that is what we have at
the abstraction layer and the choice of representation,
which is a technique. They're going to help
us answer whether that connection is a good one. So expressiveness
and effectiveness are going to be the
things that we will use to measure
whether something is good or not at this boundary. So what does this
particular idea means. So again, we're going
to come back to our dataset where we
have names and scores. We have a set of things
that we want to express. So this is the notion
of expressiveness. So that A is one, B is five, C is two. That A is five times larger than, sorry B is five times larger than A and C is two times
larger than A. This is express. The set of insights are expressed in this
particular visualization. That is all these facts can be understood from
this visualization. So we've made a decision about which facts we would
like to express and made sure that the visualization
actually supports that understanding in
the mind of the viewer. We could've have picked
a different set of encodings. So this one is a
representation of this data through circles and
a particular shade of red that is telling
us the values. So we're going to use
this white for A, this pinkish color for C, and this red color for B. Now from this, we're not expressing what
it is that we want. So we have a set of insights
that A is one, C is two, and B is five, but you actually
can't read that from this particular visualization
because we have no legend. We have no indication. So this particular
visualization does not express what it is that we want. So this does not express
the set of facts. So this is going to be important. If we added the legend, it might express it but in
its current instantiation those sets of facts cannot be inferred from this visualization. The criteria that
we're going to have is again these two full criteria,
the expressiveness. A set of facts is expressible in a visualization if
the visualization expresses those facts and only
those facts. That's ideal. Effectiveness, it's going
to be this other question. How is it that people are going to be able to read from
the visualization. Are they going to
be able to read it accurately or inaccurately? These are going to be
two separate criteria. We focused mostly
on expressiveness. I want to lead in a little bit
into effectiveness. So this is our task again. Given the data and tests we're going to try and understand whether our choices are
effective and expressive. So let me give you
a few other examples just from real visualization,
so you can see this. This is a visualization
of cars from 1979. You have mileage
per gallon mpg on the X-axis and you have
price on the Y-axis. So mpg over here on the x, price over here on the y. You have these little
plus marks which represents a particular cars. What this visualization
expresses is the relationship between
mileage and price. So you can basically
see that there is this kind of correlation. You can see this kind
of correlation that basically says the cheaper
the car for whatever reason. Mileage per gallon
goes up probably. The car is smaller and lighter, so you get better at
miles per gallon. We can make all kinds
of hypothesis about why this is true. But what this does not express is the relationship
between specific cars. That is there might be
specific cars that I care about, like a Ford and Toyota and it's not possible to read
this visualization and figure out how much different
the Ford is from the Toyota because I can't find those
things in this visualization. So that is a set
of things that is not expressed in
this visualization. Now, if I added the labels, now I can answer both questions. It expresses the
relationship between miles per gallon and price. So we still see
this relationship, but we can also identify
the cars that we care about. So if we want to
compare this BMW over here to this Accord down here, we can find those points
and make that comparison. So we can say
how many more miles per gallon does this car
get against this car? How much more expensive is this car relative
to this other car? So that is something
that is expressed. Now, again this might over express if we don't care
about specific cars. So if all we cared about in the visualization was to
make sure that the person should be able to
understand that there is this correlation between
miles per gallon and price, this data that has these extra labels is
now full of clutter. It makes the task of seeing the correlation a bit harder because we have all this
clutter on the screen. So this is over expressing if we don't
care about specific cars. Let's encode this data
in yet another way. This is a bunch of bar charts
corresponding to the car. So it's the same data
that we have over here. It's represented as
two different bar charts. So we have our accord sitting
at the top over here. We have the length of this bar telling us how much miles
per gallon it was getting in 1979 and this bar over here telling us what
the price was for 1979. So if this bar and this bar. The same data that
is expressed over here is also expressed over here. Now, this particular dataset is not effective for the task
of seeing the correlation. So if we had this correlation
that we cared about, this one over here, you can't see
this correlation anymore. That's gone. That's broken in this particular kind
of encoding. The same data is expressed
but this dataset is not effective for the task that we have which is seeing
the correlation. So again our dataset, we are going to think about
the set of rules that we're going to have in
order to encode the data. This will help us
understand whether something is expressive
and ineffective. So the sender that
is the person who's taking the data
and encoding it is going to use a set
of rules in order to transform the data. We're
going to take the data. We're going to use
a set of rules. Our rules are going to be this. We're going to draw a bar
for every person and the bar height should be
one inch for every point. So bar A representing person
A should be one inch. Person B should be five inches. Person C should be two inches. That is going to be the rule
that we are going to have to represent
this on the screen. Why is encoding rule-based? It's rule-based because
we have a viewer. The viewer is going to need to decode this using
the same set of rules. So given what the reader understands about the rules
that we're used to encode, they can decode the data
and make this inference. So they can basically go back and reconstruct the dataset
using the same set of rules. Now, of course, just
seeing this figure, I can ask you is there
enough information to decode and the answer
is actually no. The answer is no because
if thrown away the labels. So I'm missing a rule in this visualization that would actually
allow me to do this. So I need to add a rule
that says put the label, C is a little bit offset, but C down here. That's going to tell us which bar corresponds to
which thing, sorry, which bar corresponds to which person and the axes
is going to tell us how tall something is and what the value is
in terms of score. So now we have
enough information for the reader to be able to
decode this visualization, but that of course depends on their ability to
understand bar charts. So we have this
assumption underlying all of this that someone actually knows how
to read bar charts. So when I have
encoded this data in a bar chart with these axis
and these labels, we're making the guess
that the person has actually able to read that, which is usually
true, but not always. So let's take a different text. So we're going to
have this encoding. We're going to now have
a different set of encodings. So now we're going
to have a rule that says draw a circle
for every person, set one to y, five to red and interpolate
everything in between. So this is our visualization
that we showed before. But now we have
the legend at the bottom, which actually makes this usable. So this is a different
encoding of this data, a different set of
rules which again we can ask is the person
able to look at this visualization
and decode back the table that was
used to create it? Here's the final one. This is a set of rules that's based on stars and so the size of these things
correspond to the values. We have again as star
for A, a star for B, and a start for C and we
have a legend at the bottom, which allows us to determine the size correspondence
to the actual value. Now, we have these choices and what we're going to
try and figure out is which is better and this is
99 percent of our work is figuring out whether
our visualization was the right thing, whether we made
the right set of choices. So all these things are
equally expressive. Our goal in
the next little bit is going to be figuring out
which is the most effective. Again, our takeaways are
to find good encoding. To measure how good an encoding is we're going to use
expressiveness and effectiveness and we're going
to talk a lot more about effectiveness in future lectures. Expressiveness is the fact
that can be decoded. Effectiveness is how
well we can decode them. So that is a subtle difference
that we're going to try and disentangle in
a separate lecture. With that, thank
you for listening.
