Welcome back. We're continuing our adventures through data
models and I want to talk about three words that
you're going to see a lot of when we talk about
visualizations and encoding; nominal, ordinal,
and quantitative. To understand this,
we have to go back to our little puzzle pieces
and remember that we have the abstract layer which includes what
the type of the data is. Then we're thinking at
the technique level, how we're going to encode it. So this is this process
that we're going to do over and over and over again, mapping between the data and thinking about
visual encoding and visual metaphors in order to generate the marks on the screen. So there's going to
be marks that are better for different kinds
of data sets. So depending on whether the
data's nominal or ordinal, we're going to use
different kinds of marks. But before we do that, I should explain what these
things actually mean. So there's a set of different
ways of talking about data. One of the most common was pushed by these two guys,
Stevens and Ware. The idea here is that we have different kinds of descriptions of what data means
and what it is. So nominal data represents data that's labeled or unordered. So people's names, the names
of departments in a company; those things are
nominal, there are categorical labels that
we're going to use. Ordinal are things that we can order but don't
necessarily have a sense. We can say whether one thing
is bigger than the other but we can't say
how much bigger it is. With interval, what
we're looking at is a description of the data that represents a gap or comparison. So if we had a timeline and we have these two points
over here and here, we might know that
this time started at five, ended at 10 and we might know then that this interval over
here has a length of five. So that's what we
have in the interval. That is a particular
numerical construct over which we can do
different kinds of comparisons. So if we had these
different intervals, we would be able to compare them using mathematical
functions. So these two intervals
on these lines would be comparable through
mathematical functions. Ratios also allow for comparison, but often we're
dividing something. So we might say that we have two people out of five
have a certain property. So two-fifths is this ratio that represents some interesting data
set that we have. It's normalized in some way
using this number five. But numbers like 2.5
also are classified in this general scheme as being numerically useful
because we can compare the number 2.5 to the number 1.5. So we can have mathematical
operations on these. We're going to lump
a few of these together into category data, integer data, and
real number data. But we're actually going to name them in a very specific way, just so it's easier to
remember and compare. So we're going to
call nominal nominal, we're going to call
ordinal ordinal, and then we're going to
lump together everything else as being quantitative. So if we have our data set, this is our relational table, this was our departments. There were different people
working and we knew that the ID column
was an integer. We knew that the
names were strings, the department was also a string. The salary was an integer, although it could be
uploaded if we had a more sophisticated number
like we had some pennies, also we might need a more sophisticated
representation and then we had a date. Now we can convert these into nominal, ordinal,
and quantitative. So the idea here is ordinal. We can order these
based on the number. They don't necessarily
have a meaning, so we don't know how
the IDs were generated. It doesn't necessarily mean
anything that one person is a one number away from
another person because in this case we don't
know what that means. We know that names are nominal. We know the departments
are nominal, these are categorical things. Salary is going to
be quantitative and data is going
to be quantitative. So we've transformed
this data set which has a very rich set of types; integers, strings, dates, and so on into just one of three. Ordinal, nominal,
and quantitative. The interesting thing about these different
representations is the mathematical operations
that they support. Nominal data types only
support equal and not equal. We can say is
this category the same as this other category or is this person the same
as this other person? So we might get
an answer that says yes or we might get
an answer that says no. With ordinal we can ask a slightly more
sophisticated question. We can ask does this thing
come before this other thing? So we can do this less than
or greater than operation. But we can also do
the equality operations. So ordinal takes everything
that nominal can do and adds to that a set of
mathematical operations, specifically less
than or greater than, equal to and not equal to. Quantitative expands upon that. Now we can do
mathematical operations. We can subtract so we
can take the difference. We can say how much bigger is one thing relative
to the other. We can multiply
things, we can divide, we can do lots of sophisticated
mathematical operations, and of course we can
do the less than, greater than, equal
or not equal, right? So by definition
anything that we can do in nominal or ordinal
we can do in quantitative. Everything that we
can do in ordinal we can pull from nominal. Nominal is exclusively
equal and not equal. Let me give you
a specific example. These are a bunch of
different buildings that we've overlaid on top of an axis. So you have One
World Trade Center, Empire State Buildings, so
these are different buildings. The height which is represented
as the height of the bar; on the y-axis is giving
us the number of meters. So how tall each of
these buildings. This is quantitative. A quantitative
representation of this data and it is two scale. So I can compare how much taller the Empire State Building is relative to the Bank
of America Tower by simply reading where they sit on the y-axis and
make that comparison. So we can look at
this difference over here and for how much bigger one
is relative to the other. So this is a quantitative
representation of this data. Now, if I had taken these away, the axes away, and
then I only made, so you can see I'm switching the sizes just
a little bit so that the difference between
them is equal. Let's go back, the difference
between them is equal. So this distance, this distance, this distance, and this distance. Just so we can order them, we can say that the New York
Times Tower is the smallest of all of these and the One World Trade Center is the biggest of all of these. We can say that the Bank of America Tower sits in the middle. But aside from that we can't
actually say how much bigger the Bank of America Tower is relative to
the Chrysler Building. That's not possible given
this representation. First because it's
no longer to scale. Second, because we've actually
taken the scale away. Finally, we have
a nominal representation. This is not to scale and
no scale but we've also transformed the data
so that they're basically all the same height. Looking at the shapes of these things we can
tell that they're different and their
placement on the x-axis. One World Trade Center
is a different building than the Bank of America Tower. This is a categorical
thing, it's nominal. We can basically say that
these things are equal or not equal but we can't say
anything else about them. We can't compare the heights
of them or anything else. As you might have been inferred from this particular
sequence of things, we've gone from
buildings that are quantitative, to buildings
that are ordinal, to buildings that are nominal, we can actually do
transformations in any direction that we want. So we can go from
quantitative to ordinal. So we can take things
like movie lengths or the building heights and transform them into
ordinal things; short, medium, and long. Now short, medium, and
long doesn't tell us how much different medium is from short or long is from
short and so on. But what it does allow
us to do is draw a scale and put on one end short, in the middle medium, and at this end long, and we can say
the shortest stuff is over here and the longest stuff
is over here. But pretty much nothing else can be inferred from this data. We can place the data on this line but nothing else can be learned from it other than the medium things are
bigger than the short. We can also go from nominal to ordinal just by
doing basic sorts. Like if we took the names
of all the buildings, we can sort them
alphabetically and now we have an ordering that's
inferred from this. So the thing with
the lowest letter like Bank of America Tower
would come first and then the Chrysler Building and
the Empire State and so on. So that's a way of transforming nominal data into something that can be ordered. Whether that's useful or not depends on what you're trying to do but that is
something that we can do. From ordinal to nominal, we can just basically
throw away the ordering. So we can say we don't care. So that's a really
simple transformation where basically we
just tossed the data. Let me give you
one specific example and this is related to toast. We're going to take
data set that's constructed from a bunch of observations about temperature at which toast is made
and burned and so on. So we're going to
have different ways of collecting this data. One way is we can have an
experiment where we're actually going to measure
the temperature of the toaster. So we have an experiment. Experiment one, two,
three, and four, and we have temperature readings. So we've collected these by sticking up thermometer
into the toaster. Don't do that. But we can
stick a thermometer into the toaster and figure
out how hot it is. That is a quantitative
representation of this data. We can of course transform
this into ordinal. So we can say everything above something is going
to be classified as hot, everything in the middle
is going to be warm, and everything below some number
is going to be cold. We can also look at
some nominal thing. So talking about whether toast
is burned or not burned. That is a categorical
representation of the data. We can do a different kind
of experiment where we look at what the thermostat. So let's say our toaster has a bunch of different settings
that we can make. So this is on the outside
of the toaster. It basically has some level
that we can set; cold, hot, freezing; I don't know why you'd have
this but cold, hot, freezing, and so on. These are things that we can read toaster off the side
given the setting. We can again do burned
and not burned, that's possible to infer. But it's hard to think about what quantitative
would look like. So how do we transform
this ordinal value into something that's quantitative without getting additional data? So maybe we learn
that when you set the thermostat of
the toaster to hot, on average it will be
a certain value of temperature. So we can transform
everything that's hot in this data set into a quantitative
number and use that. But that isn't actually
accurate, right? We've lost a little bit of the data in the subtlety because that hot setting actually has a range of different
values that we can take. The same thing that
will happen if we just look at
the categorical variable. So if we represent this data as being
burned or not burned, the toaster is burned
or not burned, we can look at that but it's really hard to go back
and figure out what the temperature was or what the ordinal value was in terms of the setting
on the thermometer. We could get burned
toast by simply having a low heating element that's running for
a really long time. So we don't actually know though we can make
an inference about what burned or not
burned looks like in terms of ordinal or
quantitative values. So transformations are
possible as you saw. We can basically go
from one to any of the others but the semantics
might be weird. That is the meaning of
those things might be strange and the transformation
might be lossy. We're losing information. We're going from
a small set of things, burned or not burned, into something that
has a wide range and we can't really do that well. So transforming into
quantitative values is hard. So just to put this
on the screen, burned or not burned, we're going to have to settle for a temperature that's
either high or low. So not burned we might say is 30 and burned we'd say it's 300. But this isn't really
accurate, right? Like that is not actually
capturing what's going on. In the middle of this ordinal variable suffers
from the same thing. Cold and hot are
the two things we can do if all we have is
burned or not burnt. So how do we think about this? I'm going to encourage you
to determine your goals. So distinguish. Are you trying to distinguish between
entities and values? So are you trying
to know if Alice this one individual is the
same or not the same as Bob? That might be a nominal thing. Do you care about
ordering these things? So do you care to know
that Alice's height is bigger than Bob's height
in which case you might want to encode this data in an ordinal way or do you want to compare
things numerically? So do you want to know that
the average male height minus the average female
height is 55 inches? So the difference between these two average is 5.5 inches. The takeaways are that
nominal, ordinal, and quantitative will have very good coverage
and will demonstrate that over and over again as we start to construct
visualizations. But these three things are basically great and sufficient to cover a wide array of data types that we're going
to use in visualizations. You're going to be constrained
by the data that you're given but often you're given in terms of raw
quantitative things. So that is, in
most situations you're going to be given data that
are basically numbers, like 55 or 32 or whatever it is, from there you can
make the decision that you're going to
throw away some of the nuances of this
and go to ordinal or nominal representations
depending on your questions. But that's this last point, which is that you
need to think about the comparisons that you
would like to support. All right. With that,
thank you for listening.
