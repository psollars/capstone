Welcome back to
our exploration of design. What I want to focus
on right now is this notion of information
visualization ethics. As a visualization designer
and particularly one where you're trying to
communicate to the public, you have a lot of power. So you have an ability through
different choices that you make visually to convince
people of certain things, to make them believe
certain things. So you have to consider how to act ethically when you do this. Again, visual things like as we talked about when we
talked about perception, like that's the primary source. When you encode data visually, you're able to do a lot of
different powerful things. So again, we're going to
consider how we might act ethically when we make
design decisions. So how should we
think about this? Let me show you
a few specific examples that pull out some key ideas here. The first is this visualization. So this is a visualization
showing gun deaths in Florida. It was put out by Reuters. It has this
interesting aesthetic. It uses there's a red background
or what looks like a background, looking like blood. If you look at the visualization you can read into it like something about
what happened when Florida enacted
the standard ground law, which is basically
a law that allowed you to shoot someone who
was confronting you. So you were able to legally use a firearm in a way that you
hadn't been able to before. But the visualization is perhaps showing you is that if you're not reading the axes is that gun deaths went down
when this happened. What is actually a case
and what became very controversial about this is
that the axis is flipped. So using the metaphor
this was not necessarily done intentionally
or with ill intent, they were trying for
this metaphor of this blood coming
down from the top. But because they did that, because the blood is going down, we're going from
zero at the top down to 1,000 and that's
increasing number of deaths. So if you're not
paying attention to the axis which is
perhaps reasonable given the way most people read
charts of this type where zero is often at the bottom and 1,000 would be at
the top over here. What you're getting a sort
of a flip perspective. So this is the same data
just reverse. What you see here is a very different story that is perhaps more in tune with the way
people read line charts. What you see here is
the number of gun deaths increasing which is
actually what happened when the law was introduced in 2005. This is more accurate
depiction of the data. So in 2005, this law came into play and gun deaths are not
going down they're going up. So ethically, given the way we know people read
the visualization, it might have been
more appropriate to choose the visualization on the right if we didn't have
a political point to make. So if we're trying to make
a political point and perhaps trick people a little bit then we might have chosen the visualization
on the left. If we were trying to be accurate given the way
people understand the data, the thing on the right might've
been more appropriate. Here's another example and
we've seen this one before. This is a visualization
of Obamacare put out in this case by
the Republican office. You see this very
complicated network diagram showing you how all these
different things interact, and it conveys this message of complexity,
difficulty, ugliness, like all these things
are being conveyed in this particular choice of
visualization and encoding. Here's a different
representation of it called graphic designers. Same data, same expressiveness
perhaps encoded a different way much cleaner the color choices are
much more pleasing. It's much more aesthetic. So if you look at the difference between this visualization
and this visualization, you might have
much nicer feelings about Obamacare and
the program and how simple and elegant it is when you look at this visual
versus this one. So if you're trying to
make a political point you might choose
one or the other. So if you're trying to push for Obamacare being a great thing, you might choose
this representation, an awful thing you might
choose this representation. You have this ability again in your graphic design choices. You're encoding choices
that basically shape the opinion of the reader
even with it's the same data. So thinking about
this in terms of ethics is going to
be important here. There's a political point being made in both
of these cases, and that would be important
for you to consider when making your own
visualization choices. Here's another example. We saw this when we talked
about contexts. But this is a dataset
reflecting climate change. This is a case
where you can shape opinion using different
kinds of contexts. So climate change, it turns out that very few degrees change
is actually very important. So if you have only a couple of degrees that
are being changed, so two to four degrees, that's actually
a critical point does believed in climate change. So if I only show you between 56 or 58 or in 55 and 60 degrees, you can see the change over time. You can see this increase and there's other visualizations that similarly show these
things through other mechanism, but you can here see that in a very obvious
significant way. Now, if I wanted to make you believe that this change was not important and the fact
that we're pretty actually stable across time, what I would choose to do,is use zero degrees as the base line
and 110 as the peak. So here, it looks almost like
the data is not changing. Basically we're flat across time. It conveys the idea
that the temperature changes that we've experienced recently are not as important. So in adding that context, from going from zero to 110, we've actually hidden
the main message. Again, this is done
politically for political purposes to
mask certain things about the data and convey
a certain idea that things are not as dire or things are not changing in
a significant way. Here's another last example
to talk about. This is a really small choice. So this is a visualization
that shows you the probability of
some candidate winning, so the percent of likely voters. In this particular case, we're using a box plot
visualization with these whiskers conveying
confidence interval or some other probability, there's different things
that we can use, the probability
the whiskers fork. So this is the range of things that the rope
might look like. So we might say that
this candidate might get from 25 percent of the vote to 37 percent of the vote or something like that,
that's the range. This particular
visualization techniques reinforces the likelihood
that this is more likely. People prefer to read
visualizations like this in terms of containment containing the most
likely things. So the person will likely read that this is
the most set of likely thing, and this is absolutely
the most likely outcome, and this is unlikely. Whereas this is not the case, it's true that this outcome is as equally likely
as the outcome. That's not read in this
particular kind of encoding. So again, this containment idea basically causes the viewer to interpret certain
probabilities as being more likely than others whereas
they should be the same. So an alternative technique
is something called a violin plot which actually gets you to read
the data more accurately. So there the probabilities
become much more obvious using this shape as
this extra encoding thing. So using this plot, and that doesn't have
this notion of containment, it's much more accurate. Now, if I was trying to fool you, if I was trying to get you
to think about data in a certain way like
the likelihood of a candidate winning
or not winning, I might choose to use the visualization on the left
that weird box plots, the bar chart on the left. If I wanted to convince you or make you believe
something that wasn't necessarily true because this is a really simple example of where a design choice
has an impact. We have to be very careful about this whether
we're intentionally or unintentionally doing this to our viewers when we're
constructing visualizations. So the takeaways are that communicative
visualizations are not intended to be in one ear
and out the other thing. You're not reading
it and internalizing the data for a second and
then forgetting about it. Our goal when building communicative
visualizations is that we're trying to teach
our readers something, we're trying to get them
to learn, remember, and believe whatever it is something about
the underlying data. So that's clearly
important first to be honest about what it is
that we're intending to do. It's also important for
us to consider this when reading other people's visualizations
and critiquing them. They are trying to
shape a certain belief in our minds about
the underlying data. So it's important for us
to consider that both in making our own visualization
choices and critique. Design can impact belief. This is going to be crucial
and it is not neutral. So you should consider this when making your
visualization choices. With that, thank
you for listening.
