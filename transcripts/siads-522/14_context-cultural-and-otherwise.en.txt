Welcome back to
perception and cognition. I want to talk a little
bit about context, cultural and otherwise
that might impact the way you perceive information. The first one has less to do with cultural contexts but on
the context of the data. So let me give you
a specific example. I'm going to show
two different images one on the left and one over
here on the right, and this is a really
interesting optical illusion. We're going to think
about the size of the middle circle
in this image and the size of the middle
circle in this image. Because of the context, that is the other things
around those middle circles, you're going to see one as
being bigger than the other. So most people looking at the left image will
think that this circle, the middle circle over here is small relative to
the circle over here. They're actually
the exact same size. So depending on the context
in which we put information, our perceptions can be fooled. Okay, so that context, those distractors and what they look like relative to
the data of interest, will actually change
our understanding. So this is how the context of data and how we present it needs to be understood and thought about when thinking about
our visualization design. Part of this is that
we won't be able to know whether this comes
into play until we actually put our data
on the screen and try a few different
experiments to see whether these interactions
are happening or not. The other thing that I
want to talk about is the context of past experience. So if I show you these three different
visualizations and when I ask you to think
about what they mean. Your past experience
with visualizations, you've been taught how to read
different visualizations, you've seen them, you've
seen them in newspapers, you've probably seen
them in other classes. When you are looking at
each of these three, you're going to have a default
understanding of what they mean and I'm not going to have to necessarily explain it to you. When that understanding is in line with what I actually
want, that's great. When it's not, it
becomes a problem. So this is where the context matters because I have to think about what you already
understand about visualizations. Just as a specific example, if you're looking at this
visualization on the left, this one over here, usually what you're going to understand that this
has containment. So z is contained inside of n. So just looking
at that visual, that's what most people
understand this. Boxes inside of other boxes,
that means containment, that means hierarchy and that's a reasonable understanding again, based on how we've understood these things to work elsewhere. Network diagrams,
you don't actually see network diagrams
in the real world. That is, there's no physical
network diagrams per say. But just looking at this one, you see these three
different entities A, B and C and if I ask you, "what do you think of
the different edges mean?" Usually what most people
understand this to mean is that the connection strength is being encoded through
the width of the line. So you're going to
read this as B and C being more tightly
connected than A and B. In this last example, you're probably going to be able to discern that there are different relationship
types because I've encoded these links
in different ways. So F and G have
a different relationship than E and F. I didn't have
to explain that to you. Just by looking at
the visualization and your past experience, that is something
that you took away easily by default by just
looking at the visual. The context of culture is another interesting one
that expands on this. This is a past experience but is a culturally
embedded thing. So let's take a particular
signal like red and blue. It turns out that in the US
red is often used to represent the Conservative
Party whereas blue is often used to
represent the Liberal Party. In the UK it's
actually the opposite. The Liberal Party's
often represented using red and the conservatives are often represented using blue. So that's really
an interesting problem because the visual choices
that we make in color encoding are not
going to work well depending on where that
visualization is displayed. So something that's displayed to reflect Conservative versus Liberal Data in
the US will not have the same meaning when displayed
to a reader from the UK. The context of the person
expands on this. Basically there are
personal differences, individual differences
and abilities. So age, even gender and physical impairments
are all going to impact the way we perceive data. So in our example over
here in color choices, we actually have to consider
things like colorblindness. So that's a nice feature
of something like ColorBrewer
where you can see that for a person who did not have this particular kind
of colorblindness, they would be able to
discern on the image on the left between
these five different shades. So there's these two
different kinds of red, two different kinds of green and this yellowish stuff in between. Someone who is red-green
colorblind actually only sees two different shades when looking at
this visualization. So there are tools
that will allow us to test these things
to make sure that we're actually getting
the right kind of color choices that will work well across
a broad audience spectrum. So if we want to show
five distinct colors, we should not make color choices
that only look like three distinct colors
for people who have this particular red-green
colorblindness. This relates to this
interesting phenomenon which is that there's
no such thing as average. Everybody's different
and if we build only for the average human being we
can do the wrong thing. There's a really
famous example that we use to just talk about this in the design of
seats for fighter pilots. This was done in the 1950's. They sampled over 4,000 different individuals looking at 10 different features
of their body shape. So weight, the width
of the hips and so on, and then they designed
an airplane sit for a fighter pilot cockpit that was the average of all these
10 different values across all 4,000. It turns out that it
didn't fit anyone. Okay, so no one sitting in the seat sat
comfortably after this. There was no such thing as the average human being when looking at these
different properties. So as modeled using these 10
different kinds of things, these 10 different properties of the human body even with
lots and lots of data, we were getting
the wrong kind of design. So this is important
to think about, is there are
many situations where the average is actually
the wrong thing. The last one that I want to mention is the context
of the environment. We often make assumptions about how our visualizations can be read and sometimes
they're wrong. Okay there's
environmental contexts. So are we reading
the visualization in a moving subway train
that's slightly darker and we're being
jostled left and right? Are we reading the visualization in a nice forest
where there's lots of light and it's quiet and we can think about it and
are not being jostled? We can also think
about the devices that we have access to, so the context of the device. Do we have a really
big screen that we can work with or we're sharing space? Or do we have a really
small watch sitting on our hand that's going to mediate the way we perceive data. This is going to be important, things that work well on
the large screen are not going to be the things that
work well on the small watch, just as things that work well on a moving train
are not going to be the things that works well in the office or out in nature. So these are the different kinds
of contexts that I would like for you to consider
when making visualizations. The takeaways of
that context matters. The data, the person,
and the environment, all these things should
be thought about. Designing for the average is
easier but it's not going to work for everyone and maybe not even any particular someone. So this is going to
be important to think about when making
visualization design choices. With that, thank
you for listening.
