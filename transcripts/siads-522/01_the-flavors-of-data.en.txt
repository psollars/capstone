So the focus for this sequence of lectures is going
to be around data. We're going to start
working through the idea of converting data
into visualizations, and I want to start by talking
about the flavors of data. This is going to be
important because we're going to go from things like numbers into visualizations. The process by which we do
that is called encoding, and there's a lot of different
options for doing this. It's going to be
important for us to understand the different kinds of data and why it is
that we're going to encode data in certain ways. So our goal is basically
to draw marks. Every visualization is composed
of a sequence of marks, possibly overlaid, one
on top of the other. This can go from the very
simple to the very complex, but all these things start with simple marks on the screen. So whether it's a simple circle or more complicated shapes. We're going to take all these and combine them in
interesting ways in order to generate the
visualization by taking the data and encoding it into
these sequence of marks. But specifically, we're targeting marks that allow us
to compare things. Visualization is all
about comparison. We're going to try
and use marks and properties of these marks
that will allow the viewer, that is the person
who's looking at the visualization
and it might be you, to basically understand
what it is that they're reading and be able to draw
comparisons from the data. So you might be thinking, well, this should be pretty easy, like there's only a few
different ways of doing it. But that's
not entirely true. Even with a very small dataset, like this one which only
has two different numbers, we can actually come up with lots and lots of different ways of visualizing these things. So again, this is
the smallest set of things that we might
compare, it's a set of two. But we can imagine a simple way of doing it using a bunch
of little squares. So we have one that's 12
and one that's seven, and that allows
a certain kind of comparison. This is a visualization. We can also use things like bar charts and these
might be familiar to you. The length of these things
will be useful. We might need to add
some axes labels to actually make them useful, but these are the kinds
of things that we're going to think about when
making visualizations. Again, two simple numbers. But here's a wide
array of sets of things that we can actually use to convey the same kind
of comparison. So let me pull this up and we'll walk through some of these, just so you can see
what's going on. So there's some that are encoding the two datasets as area. So this area over here. The size of the circles is
comparing the 12 and the 7. This one over here. This one is based on density. This one is based as
a fraction of a whole, so 12 percent versus
seven percent. We have, again, areas over here. God forbid, but you can use pie charts like this.
Please don't do that. But you can use
simpler ones like this that actually represent part
versus the whole comparison. So if the 12 and the seven
corresponds to everything that we can have or something,
you can combine these. We can have charts like this, like line charts and
scatter plots over here, and we can even use things like color to convey differences. These are all possibilities for showing you the difference
between two numbers; 12 and 7. So how do we pick these? That's going to be
the focus of the day. To understand which one of
these choices we should make and when we have
lots of other data, we're going to have
to think about this a lot more deeply, we're going to think about
what the data actually means. So what do 12 and 7
actually correspond to? To do that, we're going to come back to our puzzle pieces. We're going to think about where data sits in all these
different layers. As data moves from
layer to layer, we're going to think about
it in different ways. So at the very top layer, we have what the data
actually means. So scores on a math test, the number of pirates
in the ocean, the percent of patients, the relationship between genes that are interacting in the body; all these things are
at the domain level. That is what the data
actually means. These things are conceptual. They have a semantic meaning, you understand them
in a certain way. So there's time,
temperatures, space, all these things have a meaning to domain analysts or scientists. There are mental constructions and they have semantics and support reasoning
on these things. At the next layer, we're starting to be a
little bit more abstract. Now we're thinking about data in terms of whether
it's a nominal data, interval, quantitative, whether it represents something
temporal, tree or graph. At this level, we have
low-level descriptions and these correspond to
mathematical operations. Those things that we could
imagine doing mathematically on the data: adding, multiplying,
subtracting, dividing. All of these things
can be done to abstract data independent of what the data actually means. At the technique level, it turns out that we care only about a few specific types to generate most of the visualizations that
we're going to see. So nominal, interval,
quantitative, we're going to see
one called ordinal. These are the different things
that we're going to use at the technique level. Down at the very lowest level, we're going to use things that
the computer understands. So things like Boolean, short, 32-bit integer, float; these are things
that the computer understands and
represents data with. We're going to focus
mostly at the layer between abstraction
and techniques today. So at the abstraction layer, we're going to have
a high level task. This is an abstract task, not one necessarily related
to any particular domain, and then we're going
to have our data, which is nominal, ordinal, quantitative and so on. At the technique layer, what we're going to
be concerned about is the kinds of marks that
we can put on the screen. So we can put different
numbers of marks, we can use different
visual channels and we'll talk about that and retinal variables, which
again we'll talk about. But these are things
like the color, the size, the shape and so on. What we're going to care
about is this transformation. The thing called visual encoding and the visual
metaphors that we're using to transform the datasets that we see at
the abstract layer, the things that we're going
to visually represent on the screen or on paper
using marks and images. So the takeaway is just
very briefly is that, encoding is a key task
of visualization, it's going to be the focus
of the sequence of lectures. We're going to concentrate
on what data is and then mapping
data to these marks. Data, just to
reinforce this point, has different meanings
at different levels. At some levels, it's very domain-specific,
number of pirates. At the abstract level, these are things that
we can do math on. We don't actually care what
the domain meaning is, so the count is an ordinal,
is a quantitative. Then at the bottom layer,
we have implementation, which is the thing the computer
can actually understand. With that, thanks for listening.
