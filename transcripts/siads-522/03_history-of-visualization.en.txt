Welcome back to introduction
to information visualization. I want to talk a little bit
about the history of infovis and I can't do this topic Justice. I'm going to try and condense almost
a thousand years of history and to about ten minutes. And so there are other resources
that will provide for you. If you're curious about how
infovis developed as a concept. One of the first kinds of information
visualization that have ever been observed is this one, it's a map of sort of
oscillations within the solar system. So how planets have moved
nearer further to Earth. This is from the tenth Century. It's a planetary movement is the title and
this is one of the very famous examples that we will see of an early
kind of information visualization. Jumping ahead almost 600 years,
we see another example. And this is again one of the earliest
examples that we've seen. So you can see that there weren't that
many examples of information visualization in the early periods that
we're talking about though. This is how far it was or
how the distance Toledo to Rome I'm trying to calculate how far you
would have to travel. It's a very interesting visualization
shows on the x axis distance and these different kinds of things that
are in between Toledo and Rome and Italy. Jumping ahead even further,
this is a couple hundred years. William Playfair is one of
the the interesting people's, one of the interesting characters in our
story about information visualization. Actually came up with a lot of different
techniques, things like the time series, things like the pie chart are often
believed to be due to William Playfair. And so in the 1800's this is when we
first started seeing these interesting communicative to visualizations
this was done to talk about different economic concepts and
reflect them to the public. And so William Playfair came up
with a bunch of different ways of representing them, a number of novel
ways of representing them through this abstract set of shapes and so on. Around the same time people started trying
to analyze complex scientific data. So Lord Kelvin, Lord Kelvin as you know, the measure of temperature had a lot
of interesting scientific discoveries. One of the things that he looked at as
well as a lot of his contemporaries at the time were things like equations that
sort of tracked the pressure versus so the PV, nrt equation. So temperature and gas and pressure and
how they related to each other and his brother actually constructed
this very interesting 3D model of the underlying equation. So there's three variables
that are at play here. And so you can see those reflected, and
this interesting structure of this is from 1848 in a museum in Glasgow, so
you can go see this if you're interested. Again as physical structure that
is used to represent abstractly the underlying data that is something
that's capturing equation about a gas law. Another example from around the same time. This is one of Edward Tufte famous
examples of an ideal visualization. This one is created by Minard, Edward Tufte who will talk about a lot has
very strong opinions about good design. And this is one of his favorite examples. This is in case you are unfamiliar with
it is the march of Napoleon's Army towards Russia and then retreat back. So the underlying structure sort of
of the entire thing is a map and this line represents the Army
as it marches towards Moscow and then as it retreats back home to France. And the width is how many
soldiers were alive and what you can see is that this as
the soldiers advanced towards Russia, they're dying off and as they go back and
retreat they're also dying off. You can also see interesting things
like where there's a break-point, the retreat is heading back, where the
Army breaks off into two different paths. And at the bottom here, what's also
interesting because it captures some of the reasons why the soldiers were dying, were the temperature readings
as measured by army. So as the thermostat drops and it gets
much colder people start dying and so you can see the relationship between
those temperature readings and these kind of spikes in
soldiers dying on this map. This is a really interesting example
capturing lots of things at the same time. You have the geography, you have
the size of the Army, have its position. You have another variable
that you're relating to that's explaining some causal
structure the temperature and so lots of things that are being explained in
this particular very clever visualization. Jumping ahead to 1939
people started considering other ways of visualizing information so
much more abstract representations. This is a flow chart sometimes
called a Sankey diagram. This is a different kind of thing that's
relating production costs to sail districts. If you can't see it, but I'm going to zoom
in, this is actually constructed by hand. So this person Brinton, cut out
thousands of little strips of paper and then put them on a mat basically
moving them next to each other to capture sort of the underlying data. Okay, so he knew the different measures,
how much things cost to produce, sales and so on. And use the little strips of paper
to represent that information, but he had to move the strips
of paper one at a time. And thankfully we don't
have to do this anymore. Like there's lots of automated pieces
of software to support this but this is how it was done in the early days. And one of the reasons why we don't see
many of these visualizations from this time period, but
we do see a lot now, all right. So this was very difficult to
do at this early stage and so not many people could do this or do it. So in the 1950s, we started seeing
the emergence of computers and graphical displays that would support some
of the information visualizations that we will see today. And early examples were of course
focused on things like wars, okay. So this was very few people could afford
these very expensive computers and expensive displays. One of the groups that could do It was the
army and so they would visualize things like the positions of planes and
trajectories and so on. Again, very big machines very expensive,
very slow, but kind of the earliest examples of computer-aided
information visualization generation. Jumping ahead to the 1960s, it was when
groups of statisticians notably Tukey, started thinking about different
statistical charts and techniques. Is very famous for doing things
related to exploratory data analysis. And one of his ideas was the box plot,
he has many other things. He coined the word software and bit and
so on, very famous and interesting man. But constructed the box plot, and
this is an example of how to read it. There are different
pieces of the box plot. Not everyone uses all
the different features. Sometimes we use different
subsets of this installing. But this is in the 1960s we had computers, we had some underlying
question about the data and so Tukey and others started thinking about
ways of representing the data in a way that we can answer statistical questions
about them distributions and so on. Also around the same time we started to
get people like Bertin who wrote a book called The Semiology of graphics
started thinking about this idea that we were communicating
through visualization. So visualizations were symbols, like symbols that were communicating
some underlying concept. And so Bertin and others started to talk
about how to think about taking data and transforming it into visual concepts
using retinol variables as what they were called at the time. Things like shape, the size, the color,
the color intensity, the texture and all these things were things that we can
manipulate in order to encode the data. As a thought very deeply philosophically
about how we might take data and represent it to an underlying to it, to a
set of readers or viewers looking at that data and how we might communicate
through visual techniques. We started seeing this emergence of
computers that became easier to use and more people were able
to get a hold of them. They became more prominent in the 1970s. And so this is Tukey again sitting at a,
looks like a desktop in early desktop and demonstrating some visualization
technique, using this display. And so we get computers being introduced
into lots of other places people more readily being able to program them
build a new kinds of visualizations. Jumping ahead 20 years. We're now seeing computers
all over the place with very sophisticated graphical techniques. So we could start seeing
things like 3D displays, within the 2D structure of the of the
screen and so people said, this is cool. Now we can do 3D within this 2D structure. Let's start thinking about really
clever visualizations that use these 3D effects within the screen. And so this is an early example from Xerox
Parc and something called a cone tree, think of it as a basic tree
diagram just in three dimensions. And of course,
you need it interactivity and to be able to move these
things in order to use them. Now, we don't actually
use 3D much anymore. It turns out this is not a useful
thing for various perceptual reasons. But there was a time period when people
were really fascinated by the use of three dimensions and so they started
building visualizations like this. Jumping ahead to the 2000s, now we're starting to see
software available for everyone. So this is something that's
not available anymore. But many eyes was
a product brought by IBM. It was a web-based solution to allow
people to upload their own data sets and get really interesting
visualizations out of them. So there were lots of different
kinds of techniques supported within this piece of software
within this website. And so you could generate in your
visualizations on your data get the visualization back and
embed it on your website, which is really kind of cool and powerful. This is for people who weren't able to
build visualizations on their own but could now use prepackaged services
to basically get their data transformed into a visual thing that they
could take away and put on their website. We started also seeing the emergence
in the late 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and so on of really sophisticated
and powerful pieces of software. So this is Tableau again, which gives you
an interactive way to build visualization. It is intended for business analysts, people with some sophisticated
domain expertise. But there are basically able to drag and
drop different things from the data set. So they have the data over here and
they're able to say, I want to drag so here we have segments and category, they're able to drag these
things over into here. And the visualization in the middle
automatically changes and is displayed in the most
appropriate way possible. So if the most appropriate thing to do was
use a bar chart, it would start with a bar chart, if it was a scatter plot, it would
start with a scatter plot and so on. And so this is a really clever tool,
does a lot of things automatically for you simply by dragging and dropping columns from one piece of
the display screen to the other. People have started thinking about
other kinds of tools that maybe not for business analysts. This is a tool called Data illustrator. It's intended for people who think
in terms of things like illustrator, like Adobe Illustrator and
want to generate visualization. So here there's a focus on drawing
the things that you want and then combining those with the data. So you might draw a set
of these boxes over here. So each of these will then be connected
to an underlying piece of data and the boxes will change in
size based on the data. But first you're going to focus on
the drawing, the visual element of this. So if you're a very visual person you'll
be able to sketch out what you want the visualization to look like and then
connect that to the underlying data set. With the ability to generate
visualizations easily. There was an increased expectations,
but people working in specific domains. Like in this case the biologists
that visualizations will be crafted specifically for them. So a lot of really custom crafted
visualization systems, visual analytics systems that were catered to the needs
of specific domain scientists. So this is a very interesting change and we will see in a lot of cases now specific
pieces of software that you can download that are very targeted
towards specific problems. So microarray data, learning analytics
software all these things that have been custom-made to
particular set of tasks. And it's possible to very easily
build these things now and so lots of people have started making an
industry of basically generating one-offs of these kinds of visualizations. Because you can do that by
combining different elements and different libraries and to into
these more sophisticated dashboards. The takeaways, the takeaways are that information
visualization has evolved significantly. We've seen over a thousand years,
a really significant set of changes. Things have basically gotten easier
which I've made it very possible for anyone to generate information
visualization, which is why we're going to focus in this class on how to make
generate good information visualizations. So well, used to be expensive to encode
you saw that kind of paper cutting now, it's cheap to encode. While most things were private, it was
hard to sort of produce these things at scale and make them available to everyone. Now, it's easy to throw things up on the
web and get very public visualizations. While it used to be that there were
few very domain specific tools, was expensive to own computers,
expensive to build software for them. Now, you can build a zillion
different pieces of software and release them on the web. So there are many domain specific
tools that are available now. So all these things have been changes for
good largely, but they still require us to think about how to generate good
information visualizations. So what are the appropriate techniques
to use given different scenarios. And with that, thank you for listening.
