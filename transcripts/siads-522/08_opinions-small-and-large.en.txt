Welcome back to
our discussion around design. What I want to talk about
a little bit more now, is sort of opinions both small and large that
people have had and have provided for you to use when deciding how to design
visualizations. So there are some that
are going to be great and some that are going
to be less great. We have to be able to
look through the space of design suggestions and identify those ones that are useful
and appropriate for us. So as I mentioned
in past lectures, there are often these chart
suggestion visualizations, these graphic selectors that basically attempt to help you. So you are asked a question like, what
are you trying to show? Are you trying to
show a comparison? So if you're down here, are you trying to
show comparison? Are you trying to
compare different items? Do you have more
than two variables? If you are, then maybe you want variable with column chart. Like maybe that's
the best solution for you. So if you trace through
this diagram and depending on your answer
you're going to get different kinds of
charts suggestions. Different people have crafted these kinds of charts suggestion things for very specific, very small kinds of
statistical things. They're great and you
should take a look at them and understand
where they come from. This is something that's coming out of Northwestern University. You can take a look
at it in more detail but again making
suggestions about the appropriate ways
to visualize data given certain sets of
comparisons. Here's another one. This is a qualitative
chart chooser by Jennifer Lyons and
Stephanie Evergreen. They're both quite prominent in the visualization
space and have made this meta visualization
to help you pick a chart. Here's another one from
the Financial Times. That is a visual vocabulary, sort of a list of
things to pick given different charts objectives
that you might have. So these are a great, these are all perfectly
reasonable places to start. Sometimes they're going to agree, sometimes they
disagree a little bit. If you have very specific small
kinds of choices to make, like you're trying to
build a very specific kind of visualization around
statistical data, these would be
a great place to start. Or you start running
into problems of course is when you're
combining these things. So that's when we have to look at slightly more general rules. So some of what we've
seen from Tufte so far and what I'll show you
right now from Tamara Munzner, who was also a very famous
visualization researcher. In her book, she comes up
with a set of rules of thumb for making
visualization choices. These are going to be
at a very high level. Whereas these are very low level, these are going to
be very high level. So things like this. No unjustified 3D. This is a little bit
corresponding to some of the chart junk discussion
that comes from Tufte, but it's actually driven here by sort of an understanding
of cognition. 3D is hard for people
especially when you're displaying
something on a 2D surface. The paper or the screen,
these are two-dimensions. Now 3D is a little bit weird. Even if you had two 3D, it's really often hard
for people to understand. There's issues of occlusion, things sitting one in
front of the other, perspective,
interpretability, and so on. 3D is great when
you need see shapes but often really is unjustified. The other converse thing is that, unjustified two-dimensions
is actually a bad as well. So if a list is good enough, you don't need to do
two-dimensional visualization. So why have a visualization that looks like this if you
have very few data points? Maybe you just want to show
a table with the numbers. So you shouldn't be
using visualizations just for the sake of
having a visualization. Eyes Beat Memory, I'll come
back to this in second, and then get it right
in black and white. So make sure it works
in a standard print out before you try to use fancy
things like colors and so on. So you can add all kinds of
different kinds of things but the last point that
I want to make coming from Munzner's
roles is that, function should come
first and form next. That is not to say you
should not have chart junk, you should not add
embellishments, but make sure that the function that you want to support is actually available first and then you can add
stuff to it later. So this eyes beats memory point is an important one that
I just wanted to push. Again this is a high
level piece of advice, but it's a pretty decent one
to start from. We haven't talked much
about animation or interaction in
this series of lectures, but you will see
that in the future. So don't go to
those things immediately. Thankfully I haven't
taught you about them, but don't go to
those immediately. It's often easier to
compare things that are on the screen than to
compare them in memory. So if you think about a
display that's changing, and you need to compare version 1 and then you interact with
it and you see version 2, it's often difficult
to do that rather than just having both visual things on the screen at the same time. So remember this notion
of change-blindness. If you have this kind of
weird interjection between the things that you're seeing as you're interacting or animating, you're going to run
into change blindness. So that's not going
to be great for you. Eyes beat memory,
this notion encourages you to think about the fact
that you can probably get more data density on the screen than you
think you can get. There are ways of layering data. So when we think about
building different kinds of visualizations that have
lots of sub-visualization, we can often think about layering or having
visual hierarchy. Basically allowing the person
to walk through a space of different sub-visualizations
to understand the data in this
much more rich way. So it doesn't need to be
the case that you always have, does really simple charts
one next to the other. You often can layer them in a way that supports
different kinds of things. So you can guide a person through like a visualization
that looks like this. You can pull out the data and have like maybe a scatter plot for this particular
thing if it's important. You can do other things like overlaying additional data
on top of here and so on. So there are
other tricks that we can apply to layer on top of visualizations to
support more things on display than you might
think are possible. To do that again, use
your knowledge of perception. With Tufte what we got is, a set of high level things
like graphical integrity, ways of measuring the lie,
life factors of one. We talked about caveats to that, using no chart junk but
we talked about that. Sometimes it's appropriate.
Data is static. Data ink ratio, chart junk, these are things
that are often about the aesthetics and not
necessarily about function, and so you have to balance that when you're thinking
about Tufte rules. Again, these are very high-level
rules and not specific. So what about small decision? Like do we have any guidance
for small decisions like Tufte rules,
Munzner's rules? These are not often really
great when we have to think about really small tiny things. So what's a kind of
small decisions? The good news that I want
to push for here is that, if you care about
this enough someone somewhere has probably
done an experiment on it. So you can often
find good literature and good examples online
like in the academic space, where people have done
experiments to support this. This is a great place to start, if you're trying to
figure out based on some principled way whether to make a certain
decision or not. Of course you should always
read the fine print. This is going to be important in the example that I
showed you in a second. Now, let's say I have
these high-level tasks. Again, this is our puzzle pieces. We have Task 1, Task 2 Task 3. They are abstractly comparison 1, comparison 2, comparison 3. Two different
visualizations, same data. Basically the only
thing that's different between these two
visualizations is the ratio of the number of
pixels for the X and the Y. So the visualization
on the right here, this one, is much more squished
than this visualization. So here there's more
of a one-to-one ratio, here it's a little bit different. Which one should you pick? Is one more readable
than the other? Is the same underlying data
but it sort of emphasizing slightly
different set of things. So equal expressiveness, but
which is more effective? So as I said, people have done
experiments on this. So Cleveland and
and others in 1988, published this paper called the Shape Parameter of
a Two-Variable Graph. Is online chart. They said, the human eye can judge best when the lines that
are going up and to the right or basically
in this direction, they can do much better
if they're 45 degrees. This is more than 45 degrees and this is about 45 degrees. So what they argued for, is compressing
the visualization in this particular case to
maintain these slopes. Slopes of about 45 degrees are great for showing
rises and falls. Using this idea, people have created automated software that figures out what
the optimal ratio of y to x is, so that you get as many 45
degree slopes as you can. So it automatically
computes for you, how much you should squish the aspect ratio in order
to get that kind of thing. So the general rules
that come from this, you're not automating it is that wider is better than taller, but can access aspect ratio that roughly maintains 45 degrees
on the rise and fall. Now, here's the problem. In 2013, people re-approached this and did
additional experiments. It turns out that
this 45 degree idea, comes from a limited set
of experiments. Ones that did not
test the broad range of different degrees,
different banking angles. It turns out that 45 degrees
is not actually necessarily. There are other situations
where you can pick different aspect ratios that are still perfectly reasonable, even though they don't
yield 45 degrees. So in 1988, we said
45 degree angles only, 2013 we revisited Cleveland gate. This is what this was called because academics
are funny that way, and basically revisited
the idea and said, well, this is not entirely true. We actually get perfectly
reasonable answers without adhering to just
this 45 degree thing specifically. So the takeaway. Lots of rules, lots
of chart choosers, lots of experiments, these
are great places to start. Take lessons from
them when you can, but take them all
with a grain of salt. So often try to update
your learning, your readings. People are constantly
doing experiments, people are constantly
revisiting and revising rules, offering new kinds
of charts choosers. So it's really important
in this space to be up to date on the different choices that we might have
available to us, and the different kinds of
ideas that are being pushed by both academics and
design professionals. All these will be
great places to start, but you have to treat them again with this little bit
of a grain of salt. Taking their ideas and implementing them in
your own visualizations. With that, thank
you for listening.
