Welcome back to
perception and cognition. I want to talk about
a really interesting concept right now called
change blindness. I'm going to show you an image
that's going to change. So there's going to be
a bunch of flickering images, and I'm going to
ask you to look at it and tell me what's different, and this is going to be a little bit difficult, pay attention. There was a pretty
big noticeable change which you probably did
not actually notice. If I show you the two
images side by side, now it's maybe a little
bit easier to compare. You might be able to see now
that there's this big tree, there's big plants sitting behind this things
that was actually changing as the image was
flickering back and forth. So let's see this again. I'll play this again for you. Now that you know it's there, and you can see that
it's a big difference. You might be surprised
that you weren't able to notice that before, but change blindness is
this interesting phenomenon, where because I'm introducing this black interjection
between the frames, it's basically flushing
out your iconic story, your short-term memory,
because you're not focusing on this things that are perhaps
in the background, you're not able to
detect the change. So that black screen that is between these
things is going to be the thing that makes you forget basically that there
was this big change. So let me show you
a different example, I'm going to flicker this one. Again there's a quit big change, and if you're not really
paying attention, you probably missed it. Let me show you
a different example or I'm not going to have flicker now, and now you can see quite
easily what was changing, these bar was moving in
a height in the background. So before it was low and
then it became high, and you can see that when
the flicker was taken away. So why is this interesting? This is interesting because
a lot of the things that we do with visualization rely on our ability to tell
the difference between two different states
in the visualization. So change blindness relates to this idea that some things are
visualized through change, and because we're
blind to change, we may not be able to
detect the change. Turns out that
people have thought about this for
a really long time. So Tombaugh, the guy
who discovered Pluto, used this really
interesting instrument that is still in use by astronomers where they take
pictures of the night sky, and there's a little device where you can plug in
the two different images, and you can flicker
them back and forth. Like there's a little knob
that you can twist back and forth he's got
this in his hand over here, and you can flicker
it back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, this is called a blink test. This is a color image
of the same thing. Basically by looking at what's moved between
the two different images, they're able to detect
interesting changes, in this case, the solar system. So if I show
this particular thing flickering back and forth, there's a bunch of things
that are changing. So you have to be an astronomer
a little bit detect this. So I'm going to put
an arrow over here, and that's Pluto
moving back and forth. So using this technique,
they were able to basically load up multiple
images of the night sky, and look at all the
different things that we're changing between these different images
in order to detect this celestial body, which was actually moving
and was interesting. So this flicker tests, this
back-and-forth blink test was the thing that supported this ability to
detect the change. You'd think nobody actually
uses this thing anymore. This is actually
still a key part of most software that
astronomers use. So you can see
this feature called blink, which is basically
what I'm describing. Where they take multiple
pictures of the night sky, and have this ability to
switch back and forth, in this case, not through
some physical thing but just on the computer screen back and forth in order to
detect the change. So why is this interesting to us for visualization purposes? Let's say we have a visualization
that looks like this. This is a scatter plot
and we click on a button that
says add new data. If our visualization did this, we would not be able to answer the question what has changed. So that interjection, that flicker that basically prevents us from making that comparison, that little timer thing makes it impossible for us to determine what has
actually changed. This is going to be
determined in how we evaluate software that we get. We don't really want software
that sits around and blinks out the screen every time
we say add new data, because that will not allow
us to detect the change. We also don't want to be
building this kind of software when we're building
visualization systems. So just a thing to consider. Takeaways here that
the changes are really great and powerful way for detecting
interesting data features. But change in blindness can
impact those comparisons, and so we're going to be very cautious about the way
we pick and use, and implement software
to support this kind of detection in visualizations.
With that, thanks.
