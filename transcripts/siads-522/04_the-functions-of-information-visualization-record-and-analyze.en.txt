Welcome back to Introduction to Information visualization. I want to talk a little
bit right now about the functions of
information visualization. We've seen a little
bit of the history. We've seen a little
bit about what makes information visualization
different from other kinds of visualization. But it's important to understand that within information
visualization, we actually have
different kinds of things that we want to
be able to support. So why visualized data? There are a number
of different reasons and I'm not going to get
through all of these. But they range from
exploratory data analysis, just supporting an analyst
role on decision support, storytelling through
communicate visualizations, memory expansion, inspiration, and you'll see a number of
these pop-up over and over and over again in the different kinds of examples that I'm
going to show you. There's going to be three
specific topics that I want to cover in terms of why
we visualize data. But let me start with
this particular example. This is a very famous one
called Anscombe's Quartet. It's a nice piece of data. There are four
different datasets. So Dataset 1, Dataset
2, Dataset 3, Dataset 4, and each of
these has an X and a Y. So this is the X and this
is the Y that goes with it. This is the X and this is
Y that goes with it and so on. So there are four data sets. Looking at this data, you're
not going to be able to understand anything
as being interesting. Like just looking at the data,
nothing is interesting. So if you'd been
trained at all in statistics or exploratory
data analysis, what you're going to do and
you're instance thing to do because it's easy and cheap is to generate a bunch of
statistics about the data. So you might calculate
things like the mean and the variance and
the correlation and so on. It turns out that for all four
data sets here the X mean, the X variance, the Y mean, Y variance correlation and
regression are all the same. That is, the underlying
statistical properties using just these tests would indicate that all of these datasets
were essentially the same. So all four have equivalent properties in
the statistical sense. So of course, you're
probably realizing that the mistake here was not
in visualizing the data. Once we visualize the data, the first dataset might
look something like this. Whereas, the second
looks like this, the third and
the fourth look like this. Now you can see there's actually quite significant differences
in the underlying data. So while they have very similar
statistical properties, in fact, they have very different
kinds of distributions. If we'd only visualize the data, we would've been
able to see this. So this is Anscombe's example of why it's important
to visualize the data. So in the first one, we see something that's
actually reasonable. The dataset is nice and
fits the regression line. There's not a lot of variants, not a lot of outliers, and so on. However, a linear regression
is not appropriate in the second dataset and then
the third and the fourth, we actually see these weird
outliers that are driving the behavior of the regression and the variants and so on. So if we'd only
visualize the data, we would have realized
this and realize that that particular statistical
analysis was inappropriate. The answer that it was
giving us was that all four data sets are the
same was actually untrue. This is where it's important
to visualize the data. So always generate visualizations as you're doing
exploration of the data. Now you should not take
away from this that visualization is
the only way to do this. In fact, Anscombe himself said that you should
combine these things. A computer should make
both calculations and graphs. Both sorts of things are
interesting and should be studied and will contribute
to your understanding. So don't assume
that because we're talking about information
visualization that you should ignore other kinds of
traditional statistics, nor when you learn
about statistics, should you ignore
information visualization. You should combine those things. This is the power of
information visualization. It shows patterns in
the data that may not have been obvious to you if you had just looked
at the raw numbers. Here's another really
famous example. This is Snow's Ghost map. It is a reflection of deaths by cholera
in London, England. At the time, nobody knew what
was the cause but each of these little dots corresponds
to an individual dying. So you see places where many people have
died due to cholera. The little x's over here
correspond to water pumps. Okay. It turns out that
John Snow in exploring this data discovered where the deaths were in relation to water pumps. Not knowing at the time that
cholera was waterborne, the epidemiologists discovered
this particular property and identified this Broad
Street pump which is over here on the map and over
here when we zoom in as being the epicenter of where all these deaths
were happening. So we see lots of deaths
around there and this was intended to communicate
this fact that all these deaths were clustered around
the Broad Street pump. So by removing the pump, the handle for the pump, they actually stopped
deaths in that area. So you are no longer able to
draw water from that well. So deaths subsided due to cholera in
this particular region. It's a very nice example. It's not the fact that they discovered this through
the visualization but they were able to
communicate it well through the visualization to
other people. All right. So you saw a couple of
really nice examples due to Anscombe and due to Snow's Ghost Map of where information
visualization is useful. I want to talk about three high-level functions;
recording, analysis, and communication that you will see over and over and over again as we talk about different kinds of
information visualization. Recording is by far
the least common but one that it was used as a way of capturing data through information
visualization. So thinking about generating diagrams as a memory aid that is a representation
that was intended to preserve something
about the real-world. So this is an early example of such a mechanism,
recording sunspot changes. So each of this was
a representation of the sun and the little dots
representing where the sunspots were at
that particular day or time. So this is an interesting
example of recording things observed about the real-world
through a visualization. A more common task, so the two most common ones
that we'll see are the analyst and
communicative tasks. The next most common on analysts tasks are things where you're actually
exploring the data, trying to have your questions
about the data answered. So someone gives you a data set, they give you some questions, and you're trying to do
this thing of pattern finding that is finding
the patterns within the data or pattern-making, trying to understand
which patterns actually exist. So both these things
are analyst tasks. The visualization works here because visualization
acts as a memory aid. So if I throw two numbers on the screen just as an example, this will not be a visualization. We're just going to
throw two numbers, and I'm going to ask you to
multiply them in your head. Okay. So just putting
these two numbers up. If you're looking at this, you're going to find this
quite difficult. What you're probably
itching to do is write them down and
you've been trained in a specific way to do
multiplication in this long way, where you start to write
it out bit by bit. So you multiply
the 7 times the 2, the 7 times 4 and so
on and you're always carrying numbers and doing
summation and so on, to get the final answer. Writing down
the intermediate steps, that's this memory
aid function of paper and pencil when doing
these long multiplications. Information visualization
serves the same function. It is a memory aid
for understanding the data which is why analysts
like to use in this way. This is a nice example. This is a little bit of a communicative
visualization but again, a memory aid that's going to explain why analysts like this. This is a map, sorry, dataset of the train
schedule in France, and so you have the time
over here on the x-axis, you have train stations
going from Paris, Dijon, to Macon basically on
the Y-axis over here. Each of these lines going down is a train moving
through the network. So a train leaving Paris at seven we'll hit Montereau
around nine something, and Dijon down here
around five, and so on. So you were able to look at this visualization and
instead of having to think about a long table
that has all this data, that would have been another natural way to represent this, looking at each train
and where it was, and the time and so on. This is a really nice
representation of the underlying dataset that
can boost your memory. It basically means that you
don't have to figure out the distances between
these things and do weird summations
or subtractions, or recall which things are
leaving when or whatever. When you're looking at the table, you're able to just look at the visualization and answer a lot of the
underlying questions. So this is where
you've taken away the necessity to look at the data and remember
certain factors. You go and just are able to look at the visualization and
answer the questions. This is the power of information visualization
as a cognitive aid. Here's another example. This
is again an analyst tool. Now, we're going to
have lots of software that will actually support
some of these tests. But this is something that was used in the time of
things like slide rules, where we needed to calculate
things very easily, but maybe didn't have
access to computers. What a nomogram is,
is a visualization that allows you to make
certain decisions. In this case, how risky
different factories are built in generating food. So if we have a manufacturing plant that is making good and we want to know how likely it is that there's going
to be some disease, how often do we need to test it? So the way this was used is you would start to
answer the questions. So you would answer on a scale
of remote to unlikely, so this is starting
at step one over here for remote to almost inevitable, what's the likelihood of occurrence of
this particular thing? So you'd draw a line, sorry. So you would draw a line over here answering highly probable, and then your answer to
the second question, frequent monitoring is what you're manufacturing
control laws, and you look at the intersection
of that over here. Using that, you would carry it over to the next visualization. So whatever the value was
in the intersection here, you would pull it down to
this other table down here. Then he would start answering
additional questions. So you might start
answering questions 4, 5, and 6, and then 7, 8, 9, and so on. Basically as you are going, you would carry over the different things that
you were discovering, until you had
an answer in the end. The risk score, the sampling
rate safety and so on. So as you went through this interactive
visualization on paper, you would get back an answer
about how often you needed to test food safety
in this environment. Nice information
visualization supporting decision-making.
Very simple thing. We just have a bunch of lines, and we're connecting the
elements and in that connection, we're discovering interesting
things about the data. This is another very
famous example. This is an example of where the analysts in not using
the right visualization, might've led to a disaster. So this is from the famous example of
the Challenger disaster. So this was the space shuttle
that was launched, and it turns out that
because of some fault in this particular structure
called the O-ring, and the temperature of
the day of the launch, there was a failure
and the rocket exploded and all the astronauts
unfortunately passed away. This is the history of
testing of these O-rings. So these are
the different boosters. So booster A and booster B
at the time of the test, 66 degrees was the temperature. This was another test, 70 degrees and you can see here, this is where there was
a detected fault in the O-ring. Sixty nine degrees, 80 degrees, 68 and so on. Fifty seven we see a
miss no damage 63, we see some damage, and so on. Now, Edward Tufte
who's very famous in information visualization
basically says this was a fault of the analysts in not representing the data
in a particular way, that made answering questions
about how likely it was for the O-ring to suffer a fault during the time of the launch in
that particular day. So by not representing
the data in a different way, they weren't able to answer
this question and then launched the rocket and
the space shuttle exploded. So the example that he
pushes for is this, and he basically says that if you'd only
represented the data, there's different way
where you used a visualization that represented the temperature along the x-axis, and the number of
faults over here, what you would see
is that most of the successful launches or during these high
temperature days, that as the temperature
was lowered, you were actually
experiencing lots of faults. This particularly cold day
in 1986 would have put us 30 degrees and if we'd only extended
the line over here, we would have realized that this was an unsafe time to launch. Even though there was
no actual testing over here, we can have extrapolated and realized that
this was a bad idea. So this was an analyst
and his view, making a mistake in representing the data in a way that
looked like this, instead of a way that
looked like this, which would have actually
made it easier to see this. Now, this is a little bit
of an apocryphal story, this is not entirely true. The engineers were
aware of this problem, and so this is
a nice example that we describe as why information
visualization is useful, but not actually one that is
helpful in reality because the engineers were
doing something a little bit different
than just using this. So it's a nice story
that we tell as to why information visualization
is useful for analysts and specific intro of
his choices are useful, but is not entirely accurate. So I will give you that as a little bit of a grain of
salt when you hear the story. So just one last example of information visualization
for analysts. One of the things that we
will focus on in this class, in this particular
series of lectures, is the best way to
represent data. So there are often
many different kinds of ways to encode data. So given raw data, how do we transform it into something that
we put on the screen? What choices do we make that will support to different tasks? So this is a visualization
of sunlight over time. So we have on the x-axis
again as usual, we have time and on the y-axis, we have the amount of sunlight. You can see from
this visualization that on a day-to-day level,
you're seen spikes. The sun comes up
the sun goes down, you're seeing spikes,
they go away. So this is interesting. You're
seeing this sequential, series, this repetitive
nature of the data. But this isn't actually
telling you the whole story. If you'd only visualize
the data in a different way, that is put the data on a spiral, you would have actually seen other periodicity which
is also interesting. So this is the same data. We're going to take
this particular time series and then stretch it
out along the spiral. So going from inside out
like the spiral shape, and what you'll be able to then see are different patterns. What will happen is
that different times of the day will align naturally. So all this might be
the same time of day. So this might be 5:00 PM. This particular form of
the visualization is interesting in that you now see that there are
patterns again. All these things there's sunlight and there's
always some sunlight, but in this period over here, you're seeing something very different from
this period over here. This might be summer months, this might be winter months, or this might be a week
where we had no clouds, and this might be a week
where we have lots of clouds. This is not obvious when we're looking at the
visual in this form. So the same visualization. Same data represented on a spiral versus a time series will show
us very different things. So again, this is the power of picking the right visualization, the right encoding to support the analytical
question that we have. So if we have a question
about how the weather is impacting the amount of sunlight that we see at
different times of the day, this might be a better
visualization than this one. So just to summarize, the goal of analytical
visualization is to find patterns. This is going to be critical. We have specific
set of questions, we would like to find them. The goal is not to
explore the data, the goal is to find
patterns within the data. So just to reiterate, we've seen two different tasks so
far; record and analyze. We're going to talk
about communicate next. But the analyst tasks, these are going to be some
of the most common ones, are all about pattern finding. With that, thank
you for listening.
