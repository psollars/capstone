Welcome back. Today, we're going to focus on perception and cognition and how they
shape visualization. So we thought a little bit about the ways that people take data and they have questions and insights that they
want to convey, and those will be transformed
to visualizations. What we need to think
about today is how the vision system
and cognition will impact the way people
perceive that information. Now ideally, we'd kept his visualizations and we internalize them in the complete, the accurate way that they
were represented initially, and then are able to
extract the answers to the questions by using these data that
we've internalized. But the reality is that
there's a lot of things that impact the way we
perceive information, things like Weber's Law,
Stevens Law, Gestalt Psychology, change
blindness, and so on. These will impact the way
we actually interpret the visualizations that we
observe in the real world. So we can account for some
of these things by actually understanding the way these different laws
and principles work. This is going to be
important to us in the way we construct visualizations
and think about them. So the question
that we're going to focus on today is this, that we have our puzzle pieces that are separating out
the domain questions, from the abstraction, from the technique, and the algorithm. We're going to answer
these questions. So given the data and
the tasks that I have are my choices in representation the most effective
and expressive. So that boundary are
we basically able to answer in
the best way possible. To answer this we're
going to look at a number of topics this week. So everything from
the limits of perception, to how the perceptual
pipeline works, Gestalt Psychology, change
blindness, and so on. All these things
are going to impact the way we perceive information. So we're going to take them into account and being able to
answer these questions, why is something effective? In answering why is
something effective, that will help us understand
what is effective and make good design choices
and be able to understand whether
a visualization is good or not. This quote that's attributed to George Box is that all models are wrong but some are
useful and this also applies to visualization. The interesting thing about
information visualization is that is a model of some sort. So if you think about taking your data set that
you might have, and someone does
an analysis and tells you that the distribution
of that data is normal. So it's a normally
distributed data set. We can also make a visualization
that represents this. So this is a model of this information as expressed
through a visualization. Unfortunately, it doesn't
quite capture everything. The way a human being
will interpret this visualization will depend a lot on the visual system. So this is what we're
going to talk about today, how humans visualization system is powerful but
highly constrained. So again, we're going to do
this thing of figuring out at the boundary whether something is effective and expressive. So far we've seen
lots of rules of thumb about what works
and what doesn't. But today we want to get
that first principles to understand and predict what
is effective and expressive. That concludes
the segment. Thanks.
