Welcome back to Introduction to Information visualization. I want to talk a little bit about some related concepts
that overlap with information visualization
but are not exactly information
visualization per se. Some of these you will
have already seen. So scientific visualization is one example where those overlap. So this methane flame example, simulation it is again a representation of
real-world data. You might see other kinds
of visualizations. This one is that
the Solar System of different planets and different
artifacts within the sky and so the dots which
are color-coded based on different properties are represented, and
there's labeling. So in that sense, we do have some information
visualization here. We're seeing this density,
we're seeing dots. But again, it is a reflection
of the real world. Each of the dots and
its placement corresponds to the physical placement of
the thing in the night sky. So these things
exist and are again, real and so are not in
the sense of the word abstract but this is not an abstract
representation of the data. The other related concept
which I want to bring up very briefly is cartography, so mapmaking and there are different kinds of cartography. Information visualization
has some relation to them. This is a map of
an island, Easter Island. It's a very nice visualization. You see the placement of the different statues
on Easter Island. You see points, you see indications of where
the peaks are. You see where the beaches are, you see the other
islands and so on. This is all represented in this very nice map
which has elements of information visualization
like there is a little representation
again of these sculptures. There's other things that are being used to
represent towns. This is an abstract
representation. You're not seeing the actual
picture of the statue, you're not seeing
an actual map or an actual satellite
image of the town. It's a little bit abstract, but not quite to the point
where it's separated from reality in the sense that
information visualization is. But there will be tricks from cartography that we
will use when we do information visualization
and there will also be instances where we combine cartography and
information visualization simultaneously for
certain kinds of effect. So for example, here's
a visualization of pressure during
a particularly cold day I think this was 1986, I
forget which date was. But you can see
the different kinds of pressure and the difference. So these are called isobars. So in each region, we have different
amounts of pressure. You can read that over
here to the side. So we've overlaid
this contour map on top of a geographical map that you might recognize
as the United States. So this is a way of combining information visualization
and cartography. Here's another example: This is a thematic map sometimes
called a cartogram. This is a visualization
of some census data. It is the number of people aged 20-24 in 2010 in the census and the color-coding that ranges from this light color down here, to this darker color over
here represented the fraction of people living in that county in
that particular age group. So you can see where there are hot spots
essentially where there are lots and lots of people age 20-24 and places where there's
very few people age 22-24. Depending on what it
is that you're doing, this might be
an interesting thing to look for in the data. So again, this is
an abstract representation, that is the population
as being represented and a color encoding overlaid on top of a standard
geographical maps. This is a combination of cartographic principles with
information visualization. So we will see that
a little bit as we continue through our adventures through information
visualization. The other thing that will be very familiar to
you if you've taken exploratory data
analysis most of you have are these statistical
graphics and charts. So these are the tools that you use when you're analyzing
different kinds of datasets and these will be very familiar to you depending on the tests
that you've had, things like histograms over here to represent
distributions of data, things like time series, understand how things change over time and the variability, things like line plots
again also usually used for time and comparing
different kinds of things. So multiple positions and walks whatever this data
happens to be. Here's another set of examples. This is a scatterplots
particularly dense one. These are called
violin plots or some derivative of them and used
to represent variability. So how many people are
smoking for example, depending on the time of day, on the day of the week and this is another map which is showing, it's like an abstraction
on top of a scatter plot. You can see the distribution on top and to the right here. So basically looking
at all the data in this direction and generating the histogram and the way
and looking at all the data in this direction and generating
the histogram that way. So it gives you a summary view of the data over here
on the right and on the top of the underlying dataset which has been summarized, so it's been aggregated in a way. So the visualization on this side might be represented in something
that looks like this. Again, all used for statistical purposes for
modeling the underlying data. Doing this allows you to
see things like outliers, patterns, and the data and so on. A lot of information
visualization will be taking some set of this statistical
graphical techniques and combining them in
interesting ways to build more sophisticated
information visualization. So you can think of
statistical graphics as perhaps a subset of a broader set of
things that we will do in information visualization. So in statistical charts
and graphics, often they will be static. Often they will require
training for use. So you're modeling the data. You need to be able to understand
how to read that model. So a histogram is not necessarily something
that is natural for a person to understand and require some training for
you to be able to read it. They are often highly
focused on specific tasks, like finding outliers,
finding trends. Whatever it is,
they're very specific, and so often you will use multiples statistical charts and graphics at the same time to
better understand the data. Information visualization
and contrasts will often leverage statistical
chart techniques. Again, we will use these
things over and over again and combine and augment
them in interesting ways. The last kind of related topic that I wanted to mention
is infographics. Sometimes people
confuse infographics with information
visualization but they have some interesting
distinct properties that I wanted to bring
up very quickly. So this visualization on by
Italian newspaper that shows different pieces of data about high speed railways in
different countries. So on the top here, you have the different kinds of trains that are being used
in different countries. Each of these maps corresponds
to different continents, so this might be Europe, this might be in the US. This down here might be
different places in Asia, some of these lines connect. So in Europe of course, there are different train
tracks that connect. This arc on the side over here for each of the continents
or each of the countries, basically corresponds
to the trains that are being run and so you can see
the speed of the train and for how long the train runs, so that is the length
of the track. So the speed of the train, the velocity, let me
do a different color, might be the width of
the arc and the length of the arc might represent how long that particular train
runs within that system. So this kind of visualization is very
self-contained but it comes with a story about the different ways that trains
are situated in the world. So there is a narrative that the author of this visualization
is trying to push. They're trying to
explain to you how different trains sit in
the world and the fact that Europe for example has lots of high-speed
railway that are well-connected whereas
other countries or continents may not
have the same thing. So this is an interesting
narrative and again, it's intended to communicate
something to you. It is self-contained,
it is static, but it's still
something that tells a story about the data but it is controlled by the person
who wrote the story. That is they crafted
the narrative in a particular way so that as you walk through this diagram, you're able to understand
different things. But again, controlled by the narrative that the author of the visualization had in mind. Here's a different example
from Paul Button. This is a nice diagram, one of many in a series showing different kinds
of Internet of things, like when they emerged and how many people were
using them and so on. You have this little
timeline again, sort of a standard technique
on the x-axis, and you have the appearance of different technologies
when they appeared, how often they were
used and so on. You see at this gray, at the bottom is a histogram
showing you additional data, so all these things are being
combined using ideas of statistical graphics and
information visualization. But again, there's a story, and if you can zoom in closer you'll be able
to see that there's a narrative to
this particular story that is being pushed
by the author and the visualization
supports that kind of narrative understanding
as you're reading. I'm going to show a couple of
interactive examples next. What's become popular
these days is to use the web to generate infographics that are both interactive and dynamic. So this is a visualization
from the New York Times, and you can see here the different pieces of
data as they're flowing, basically representing
the probabilities, so if you grew up rich
where you would end up, so rich adult, upper-middle-class
adults and so on. Again, it's very
dynamic, very engaging, you can watch the simulation
happen in real time and basically get a sense of these different
underlying probabilities. As you read down
through the story, you'll get other pieces
of this infographic that are embedded within
the actual story itself, so there's a long piece
of text that the journalist wrote and the
information visualizations, that as a whole represented
information graphic being embedded within the story
to emphasize the data, explain the data, give context
to the data and so on. So as you scroll through, you'll be able to see
a number of these kinds of smaller visualizations
that pop in, basically to explain
what's happening and provide a better understanding
of the underlying data. Again, the purpose of
this is to teach you something about
the underlying data or some set of insights that the author had as they were
analyzing the dataset. Here's another
example, this one's called the largest
vocabulary in hip hop, it's produced by this
organization called The Pudding, which produces a great number of really cool interactive
visualizations, and I encourage you to go look at their website and try
some of these out. In this particular example
what they're looking at is the number of unique words used by different rap
artists over time, so within their first
35,000 lyrics for example. So as you're looking in this visualization and
interacting with it, you're able to identify
the rap artists that uses the most words and the ones who use the least number
of unique words. You're also able to
find specific artists, so you can target specific
people to find where they sit, part of the article was about Wu-Tang Clan and
it was a group of rap artists who use lots and lots of different
words in their songs. So you can see when you filter
just to the Wu-Tang Clan, you see the artist's pop-up
that were part of the group, as a group, or as solo artists, and you can see where they
sit and they tend to be on the more extreme end of using
different kinds of words. As you go through
this visualization, this infographic
interactive again, you see other displays, so this looks like
a little bit of a histogram and you can target a little bit and see how this has
changed over time. So you can see that in the
2010, the later periods, people were using
fewer unique words, whereas in the 2000s people
were using more, and in the 1980s you sort
are in the middle over here. So this visualization
is very interesting, it lets you compare
rap artists over time, as you scroll down
you can see how rap and hip hop are
situated relative to things like rock and
country in terms of the number of unique words and the diversity of the vocabulary. You can dig further through
this visualization, it's kind of fun to play with, it's a really nice example of an interactive infographic that is built to support
a particular story, again that the author
has to tell. So the author has found
some interesting insights, they want to communicate
those to you, teach you about them
in a specific way, and so they've built
the visualization to support that task. So unfortunately people have started thinking
about infographics as this great way of getting
engagement which they are, but only when they
are used properly, and so you see a lot of
somewhat crappy visualizations. This is a little bit
tongue and cheek, but you will see lots of
infographics that show not much data actually that are interesting because
maybe they draw your eye, they're colorful, they're
visually interesting, but they don't actually satisfy any kinds of useful
perceptual elements, they don't actually teach you
anything in the end other than that's a cool thing
on the screen. So a visualization like
this is interesting but perhaps not for any kind of data purposes that we might have, so we will think about this as we think
about visualizations but hopefully not build many of these kinds
of infographics. Infographics have this property, just to summarize that
they tend to be elaborate, they tend to be explanatory, there's a communicative intent, they tend to be self-contained often where the text is part of the infographic or
the infographic is embedded inside of texts, they are frequently static, but as you saw there were
some interactive elements. Most of them will be static, they're very
traditional newspaper kind of idea that's
been integrated to the web and added to based on the
affordances of the web, like interactivity and
dynamics and so on. But again, they have
that element where they come from historically as
newspaper articles, and so they share many of those particular
characteristics of that layout, of that storytelling and so on. They may use information
visualization techniques, but where we're going to think of them as being interesting as we can learn from this approach, so especially when we talk about communicative
visualizations, we're going to steal
some of the ideas from information graphics because
they're going to be useful. The ideas of narrative,
the idea of structure, the idea of guiding your eyes
from place to place to place as you want to encourage
a certain kind of reading, those will be useful to us as we create communicative
visualizations. So there will be some overlap between information graphics and information
visualizations that we will use to our advantage. So again just to summarize, information
visualization is this, the use of computer
supported interactive, abstract visual
representations of data to amplify cognition, this is going to be
an important concept but it overlaps with a lot
of other topics, and we're going to try and leverage those as much as we can. The takeaways are
that related concepts again are going to be useful,
we'll be borrowing ideas. There are scientific
visualizations and maps which are often
like the real world++, so adding color to things that we observe
about the real world, like the methane flame, or the map of the galaxy, or taking the maps and showing temperature or pressure
on top of them. Then we have things like
statistical charts and graphics and information
graphics that are going to be useful to us when we think about analytical tasks in the context of statistical charts
and graphics, we have an analyst task, we're trying to
model the system and that's where statistics
will play a role. Then information graphics, where we're trying
to communicate, and that's where information
visualization and communication intersect, and those ideas of narrative and storytelling will be
useful to us as well. With that, thank
you for listening.
