Welcome back to
perception and cognition. I want to give you an example
of how we might use gestalt psychology for
a real-world task. So here we're going to have again our domain abstraction
technique and algorithms. So these different layers that we're going to think about. In this case, I'm going to
give you an actual task. So I have a social
network analysts who's trying to find
connected individuals. So they're given a bunch of data, like maybe it's
their Facebook social network, maybe it's something from
Twitter, or whatever it is, and the goal here is to
find connected individuals. Abstractly, that
maps to the problem of tracing connections
between entities. So each entity might be a person, and we're going to track
the connection between them. The natural technique to do this is using
a node link diagrams, so something that
looks like this. This is a very standard technique that we use in a network diagram, it will help us identify the connections between entities, in this case, it might be people. Now, we have another choice, we could use color
for link endpoints. So we could make
an equivalent visualization in terms of what it can do using
this particular technique. So here we have our entities A, B, C, and D again, and we have these little
different colored shapes that basically are
representing the endpoints. So A and B, you can see are connected because they both have these little red circles, B and D are connected, and C and B are connected. This is a way of using gestalt psychology because
of similarity and so on, but we're going to prefer the one on the left because
it's easier to read. So gestalt psychology
connectedness is actually going to be
the thing that dominates. So both things are appropriate, but this is a situation where this particular kind of
gestalt psychology principle, this notion of
connectedness is going to drive our
visualization choice. Aside to this is that there
is this notion of precedence, and if you remember this example where we had rows and columns, and our interpretation switched. So a particular
gestalt principle, that is connectedness,
overwhelms the other ones. So that's an important thing
to consider when picking between different kinds
of gestalt principles. So we have these different
kinds of things. Let's add a task. So we're going to
add a specific task, which is not just finding
connected individuals, we also want to find
communities, that is, groups of people that
have some kind of interesting relationship
between each other in the visualization. So abstractly, what that maps to is visually isolating
related entities, so being able to discern that this group is different
from this other group. One way of doing that is to use communities and color-code them. So this is a perfectly reasonable way to
encode this data. So we're going to use
node link diagram, and then encode
communities using colors. The output of this,
unfortunately, looks like this. So if we're not
thinking about where the placement or
how placement should factor in, and we just use colors and links, what we're going to
get is this kind of spaghetti diagram, where it's impossible to now
detect these communities. Even though they're
colored differently, we might be able to scan through, we might be able to
trace the lines, it's actually really
hard to work with. So this isn't quite
exactly what we want. So this isn't a great example. Instead, what we're
going to rely on is a different kind
of gestalt principle, which is we're going to place
things near each other. So we're going to use this
notion of proximity instead of color to drive communities to basically sit
next to each other. So this is a visualization where we've retained the color, but it'll still work
even without it, and we're able to detect
these communities and the connections between entities looking at
the visualization. So gestalt psychology
here will give us this great feature of
being able to find both communities and
the relationship between entities by using this
particular kind of encoding. The way we actually do this is use of force layout algorithm, and this will be something that we'll talk about much later. But this is a technique that basically make sure the points that are highly connected sit next to each other visually. So this is called force layout. So some takeaways, gestalt
principles are going to be great in both building and
understanding visualizations, but it's going to be
critical to consider what is the simplest
explanation that people will take away when looking at the visualization on the screen the one that you've created, the new technique
that you've designed. With that, thanks for listening.
