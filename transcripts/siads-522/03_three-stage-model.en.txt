Welcome back. We're going to
continue on our journey of perception and cognition and talk about the three-stage model, which is the way that we
interpret things that we see. The three stages that we
experience are basically these. One which is first, is called parallel processing. Stage 2 is what's called
pattern perception, and Stage 3 is
sequential processing. All the information
that you see will go through all these
different stages. But some of them
you will interpret quickly and some of
them will take longer. Therefore, more
sophisticated questions. All right. So let's go through
each of these in detail. So Stage 1, basically you have billions of neurons
working in parallel. This is intended
to be quite rapid. So you're able to detect things like colors, basic features, movement, and you
might think of course, this is very important from
an evolved perspective. You want to be able to determine that something is moving
quickly towards you, that something in the distance is something that's desirable. So this is something
that your brain will do quite quickly. But these things are
held in what's called the iconic store which
is very transitory. So these things will
flicker in and out. So unless you pay attention, which I'll ask you
to do in a second, you won't be able to understand what it is that
you're looking at. You'll just see that there's a bunch of different
information on the screen. So pay attention,
I'm going to put some stuff on the screen, and I'm going to ask
you what you saw. Okay. So that was very fast,
and if you looked at it, maybe some of you will have been able to internalize some of the different symbols that you experienced in
that blink of an eye. So this is what I actually showed you during that small transition, and you can now see as you're thinking through it and you're scanning through the image, what it is that was
actually put on screen. But in that initial
first impression, all you might have seen was
one letter or maybe two, this thing flickered in and
out of your iconic store, you didn't retain
many of these things. So that's Stage 1 processing. Stage 2 is a little bit
more sophisticated. Now, you're thinking through dividing the visual field
into regions and patterns. So basically, being able to
make higher-level inferences. So patterns that you're looking for include continuous curves, more sophisticated colors, patterns in the information
that you see, and so on. This relies on using working
in long-term memory. So we're beyond the iconic store, we have to dig into things
that we understand, so what a pattern looks like, and this is much more
slow and serial. Stage 3 is the last one. This is where you
have a goal in mind. So when I tell you to
look for the letter a, or I have another kind of query like finding a correlation
in the data and so on. Here, you have to look through the image that you're seeing and be able to scan through it. Call on lots of resources, and you're basically translating images into words or words
into images in your mind, you have to rely
on muscle movement because your eye
has to scan across, and all these things are very
costly but are able to do a lot more in terms of your processing of
the information. So we're going from Stage 1, which is very fast but not very nuanced to Stage 3
which is very slow. Depending on the kind of
visualization that we have, we're going to rely on each of these stages in different ways. Okay. So the takeaways
here are that there are three stages of perception and they support
very different things. They're going to constrain
us in the choices that we make in terms of
visualization choices, but they're going to be
very important and very interesting for us to think about depending on the situation. So if we're building
something for an airplane pilot where they
need to react very quickly, we might pick something that relies on Stage 1 perception. If we're thinking about making a interesting news article in a newspaper where
someone is going to sit and have lots of
time to process it, we can rely on things that are more attuned to
Stage 3 processing. So with that, thanks
for listening.
