Welcome back. We're going to continue again our journey
through data models. If you didn't watch
the other lecture on expressiveness
and effectiveness, I do encourage you to go
back and look at that. We're going to use
some of those concepts now but we're going to dive deep into the notions of expressiveness
and effectiveness, and I'll show you
a ton more examples. But it'll be helpful to
understand what we're talking about by seeing
the other video lecture. So again, we have
our diagram that is representing the different
connections between domain, abstract, technique,
and algorithm. We're asking
the specific question in these set of lectures
around judging whether this connection between
the abstract and the technique are effective
and expressiveness. Expressive and effective,
that is are they good or not. So we had our three
different visualizations that were used to
encode a dataset, so we have three
different people; and we have
three different scores or values that we care about. So person A, person B, person C. What we saw is that all these visualizations
all express the same thing. Once I explain to you
the rules by which you're supposed to decode these, you're able to take
the visualization and figure out the underlying data. So you can reverse
engineer the data or the relationships that I care for you to be
able to understand, and it's equivalent across
all three visualizations. The question that
we're going to tackle is which is better. Again, 99 percent of
the work that we're doing here is making
the right choice. So our goal here again is to distinguish between
expressiveness and effectiveness. I want to give you
the set of tools by which you're going
to be able to do this. Just as a reminder though, a graph expresses a set of statistical facts that are
inferable from the diagram. A graph does not express
the statistical set of facts that are impossible
to infer from the diagram. So in this particular bar chart, we don't have any labels. So I can't ask you how much bigger person A is from person B. That is not something
that is expressed. However, I can hope that you will understand that the first bar, this one over here, is bigger than the
second bar. There's no axis. Okay. So we can't actually say how much bigger one is
relative to the other, other than like
a vague percentage. But that is a set of
things that are expressed, that there are
four bars; bars A, B, C, and D, and without naming
them anything it's first bar, second bar, third bar,
and fourth bar. Then we can make determinations about which is bigger
and which is smaller. So we have an encoding of
four items in an ordinal sense. So this is our collection. What is expressed here,
what is not expressed here. Again, four bars
representing four things. We can order them but
we can't do much else. There's going to be
an important difference though between expressiveness
and effectiveness. Expressiveness again, is about the possibility or impossibility
of inferring things. It has nothing to do with how
easy or hard something is, easy or hard to infer has
to do with effectiveness. So let's tackle a specific set of visualizations and ask the expressiveness
effectiveness question. So the first question is going to be which is more expressive, which expresses more facts? Then we're going to ask
which is more effective. So if you look at
this visualization, I might ask you this question; which is more expressive,
which is more effective? You might have a bias based
on what your understanding is about pie charts and
what you've been told in the past
about not using them. So you might say pie chart
is not as effective, but we'll talk about
that in a second. But let's tackle the first
question first which is, which is more expressive. To do this I'm going to
give you a specific tool. We're going to look at
a visualization and having an understanding of how
a pie chart should be decoded, I'm going to ask you
to decode the values. Okay. So I know
that the total size of all the pieces
of the pie are 17. I know that, I know
the size of the pie items. So the first thing I can
tell is that there are five items in the pie, there's A, B, C, D and
E, they're labeled. So we can generate
one column that has an ID. We can also based on knowing the total size and the angle, we can infer from that
what the value should be. We can infer that the value
should be five for A, four for B, and so on. Okay. That is something
that we can read from this particular
visualization. With our bar chart, we can do something similar. We see that there are
five different items. So again we can generate
this ID column, and reading the axis or
reading along the axis, we can see that bar A
is at height five. So we can again generate this extra column
that has the values. Looking at these
two datasets that we've extracted from
reading the visualizations, we see that they're
the same, right? We see that they both have the same kinds of data embedded
in them both have IDs, both have values, they're
matched, and so on. We have the same number of IDs, the same number of
values in each. So both tables are
expressing the same set of facts so I can answer
the exact same set of questions. That tells us that
these two visualizations are equally expressive. Okay? We can answer questions
like is A bigger than B? How much bigger is B from C? What's the third largest
value, and so on. All these things are expressed in this visualization because we can reverse engineer the database by looking at the visualizations. So looking at
these two visualizations we can see that they're
equally as expressive. Now, you might look at
the pie chart and say, "Well it's actually
really hard to tell that A is equal to five." Okay? So just knowing
the angle or the size or that relative to the other pie pieces and knowing that the total size is 17, it's really hard for you
to say that it's five. Maybe you're guessing
that it's four, maybe you're guessing
that it's three. All these things are reasonable. But expressiveness again is
not about the actual data. So you might make mistakes in the number that
you pull out when I ask you how big A is or how much bigger A
is relative to B, but that is an
effectiveness problem not an expressiveness problem. The pie piece exists, it's A, and it's
encoding the right data. So it's accurate, it's
encoding the right data, and it is possible if you
had a perfect reading of angles to be able to
infer that value is five. Whether you make a mistake, whether you're slightly
over or above, that's a different question. That will be the question
of effectiveness. Now, if I eliminate a particular piece of item
in the in the bar chart, that is the axis
down at the bottom. Now, and I ask you which is expressiveness
and now you're not going to be able to make the same argument about
they're equally as expressive. So the pie chart at the top has a database
that looks like this. Again, these five pieces that are labeled and they have values, and at the bottom
we see five values but they're not
labeled so it is no longer possible to
infer which is A, which is B, which is C, and which is D, and so on. So it's not from
this visualization possible to answer the same set
of questions. So we can no longer answer like, is A bigger than B and how
much bigger is A relative to B when we're looking at the
bar chart down at the bottom. Because we have no longer
a concept of what A is, what B is, and so on. So we've made the
visualization at the bottom less expressive even though it's a bar chart not a pie chart, is less expressive than
the pie chart at the top. All right. Let's bring
our labels back in. Now, we're going to tackle
this other question, which is more effective? Looking at these
two visualizations, your instinct might be because you've learned this
in some other class, that pie charts are not
a great way to visualize data. So you're going to say
pie charts are not as effective as bar charts. What I'll challenge you
to do is to basically ask this question,
effective for what? The visualization as represented or the data as encoded through a pie chart actually is quite good for part versus
whole comparisons. So if we ask the question, what percentage is
A relative to the whole? That's actually something
that's much more easy to do using the pie chart
than the bar chart. To do it with the bar chart, I would have to either mentally stack
all these items; B, C, D, and E, or all of them together, and basically calculate
the total number and then compare A to that. Okay. So that's something that might take a lot of mental energy whereas understanding
pies and pie charts, and whole versus part, that's a thing that
you could do better in the visualization at
the top with the pie chart. The answer to
the question how much bigger is A relative to B, that one is best answered
through the bar chart. So it's easier to look at the axis label and see that
there's a difference of one. That's something that you can
do very quickly over here. So what percentage
of the whole is A is best answered
through the pie chart? How much bigger is
A relative to B? That might be
something that's best answered through the bar chart. So again, we had to ask the
question, effective for what? Before we could
answer the question, is one visualization more
effective than the other? So looking at the set
of visualizations, we're going to try and
now and figure out which is more expressive and
which is more effective. So we have our three different
visualizations. We have our true answer, and then we're going
to ask people to decode the data from that. So looking at the bar chart, can you decode this data? Looking at the circle diagram with the colors, can
you infer the data? Now, here we see that people
have a difficulty with this. Sometimes they'll say it's one, sometimes they'll say it's 1.1, is it 4.9 or five. It's because this is hard to do. It's hard to map a color like
this to a value over here. So what value should C take for example in this particular pile? Same thing over here
decoding the size stars. That might be okay
for most things but maybe it's hard for C over here, is it two or three? These things look very
similar down here. So maybe it's not so easy to tell accurately whether C should
be a value of two or three. We have our true
answer over here. We have the reverse engineered
table from the bar chart, the reverse engineered
table from the dots, and the reverse-engineered table
from the size charts. You can see that this is quite noisy relative
to the true answer, and this is slightly less noisy relative to
the true answer, and this is very clean in
relation to the true answer. So a bar chart might
be the thing that we're going to prefer
as an effective way of representing this
particular set of tasks or this particular set
of data that we wanted to show the reader. This one might be
our second choice. In this particular instance, this one might be
our third choice. So by asking how well did you extract the data by
reading the visualization, we can answer the question
of which is more effective. The noisier the data, the less effective; the noisier the reading, the less effective. So effectiveness is again
this difference between the true answer and what
the person says or sees. Now, just to make this a
little bit more complicated, we can also ask which is more expressive
and effectiveness based on the rule that
we use to encode. So we're going to have
this other slight variant of our star encoding. We're going to draw
a star for every person, but we're going to set the size proportional to the score
but we're going to throw away scores
that are one or less. So our point A is now gone, and when we've reversed this particular visualization and try to extract the table from it, you can see that the row
for A has now vanished. Because our particular rule to throw away scores less
than or equal to one, which might be reasonable given the particular task
that you have in mind, now makes this visualization
less expressive relative to the true answer because
we've lost the row. Okay. So row A has vanished
in this representation. So we could say that this one, this visualization
over here is less expressive than
this visualization over here. So our takeaways are these, expressiveness and
effectiveness are these really powerful
tools that we can use to understand
visualizations on their quality, whether they're good or not, but they are
two different dimensions and they are not the same thing. We want to know that
we are expressing the facts in the most
effective way possible. So that is going to be
the mantra that we have when we're deciding about whether our visualization
was good or not. What I've done is given you one particular tool for understanding
whether something is expressive or effective by basically simulating
the decoding process. So thinking about how a person, a viewer will look at a visualization and
decode that information, that simulation is
going to allow us to test this notion of
expressiveness and effectiveness. That is one tool and we'll see others going forward
in the future. All right. With that,
thank you for listening.
