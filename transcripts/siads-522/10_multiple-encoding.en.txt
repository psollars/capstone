Welcome back to perception and cognition. I want to talk a little bit
about multiple encoding. The reality in most situations
is that we're not just using one really simple variable. So in this example, what we're going
to work with is both height and GPA simultaneously. We want to have a glyph that is a mark
on the screen that represents both. So now we have to think beyond sort
of just red circles and blue squares. We have to think about a representation
that will allow us to encode both things simultaneously like we want to draw
one mark that's going to hold both. So how many retinol variables
do we need to encode this glyph? Of course, we need a minimum of two,
probably just two, because we need to encode
these two different features. So we're looking at a bunch of students. We measure their height and
we measure their GPA. We think that relationship is
interesting for some reason. We need two different retinal variables
to be able to encode that relationship. Do our choices matter? As you might imagine
our choices do matter. So there are different ways of encoding
this data using two different retinal variables. We have lots and
lots of retinal variables to pick from and we can make different kinds of choices. And they will impact our ability to
read the visualizations accurately or inaccurately. Multiple encodings is this notion that
we can take to retinal variables and take a specific mark and change it. So we can take a little
circle on the screen and change its color and it's area or
change its height and its width, changes the lightness
of the color and the hue. We have to consider then how
these things will interact. There's two notions that
are important to consider. One is, separable or each dimension
can be judged independently. So we can separate out the encoding
of something like height and GPA using things like area and color. There are other situations
where that's not possible. These two things are called integral. The two properties will be viewed
holistically and grouped together. So it'll be impossible to separate those
out and determine what is the height and what is the GPA for
this particular student given this mark? Okay, so let's look at a specific example. What we have here is a glyph
that we're going to use a mark, in this case a rectangle, that we're
going to use to describe students. So we're going to collect a bunch of
data from students in a classroom. And we're going to use the height of
the rectangle to actually indicate whether the student is taller or shorter. So the tallness of the rectangle will
tell us how tall the student actually is. We're going to use the width of
the rectangle to tell us the GPA, so the wider the higher the GPA. So this is a particular encoding. So if I have a really tall
student with a low GPA, I'd have a really tall, long rectangle. So it might look something like that,
okay? So that is an example of a tall but
low performing student. This is a particular encoding technique. Here's a different one. In this case we're going to use color and
height. So the taller we're
going to keep the same. So the higher the bar the taller
the student, but we're going to vary the color, the shading so
that the darker it is the higher the GPA. So over here on this side,
we have the student who gets the highest grade but
a sort of middle in terms of height. All right, so these are two different
ways to encode the same data. We've invented this mark, this rectangle, that is going to be the way
we encode the data. Again, two different ways, the height and
width or the height and the shading. And the question that we're going
to ask is, which is better? Now, if I ask you to do
that something like this. Like here's a specific task using our
initial encoding, which is the height and width, and
I tell you to sort these things by GPA. This is actually going to be
a little bit hard for you to do. You're going to have to think
about this for a while. And in part It's because you're going to
find it very difficult to separate out the area that is the interaction
between the height and the width from just the width. So being able to sort these
by GPAs is going to be hard. And again, if I ask you to
sort these things by height, you're also going to find
this is quite challenging. If instead I used our color coding scheme. So now I ask you to separate these out,
sort these by GPA, this becomes much, much easier, right? You're able to detect these
different groupings based on colors. You're not really thinking about the other
dimensions, like the size of the thing, you're just able to focus on the one
specific thing that is the GPA. In this case, and if I ask you to sort by
height, again, you can focus on the one thing, which is the height of the
rectangle and be able to determine which rectangles represent tall students and
which rectangles represent short students. So this is the notion of separable. We're looking at a particular glyph. You're able to separate out the two
different retinal variables, the shading and
the height of the rectangle. Now the difference between integral and
separable is actually very interesting, it's usually not one or the other. There's something on the Spectrum and
we can think of things that are more separable and
things that are more integral. So color and location are things
that are highly separable. Color and motion, that is if I make
a glyph that is both moving and has different colors,
those things are separable. So if I encode height and
GPA using color and location or color and motion you're going to be able to do
this kind of sorting think quite well. Whereas, if we move to the right, we see
the size and orientation, and the x and y size, and then the color based on
whether we use the red green channel or the yellow blue channel, and
this becomes really hard to tell apart. So if I encode one variable using
red green and the other variable using yellow blue, you're not going
to be able to distinguish these and be able to separate them out and
answer questions about specific variables. Okay, now this is going to be
interesting and important for us when we think about visualizations
because there are places where we're going to think about glyphs that are used
to represent sophisticated data. So this is an interesting example. It's a glyph that's
used to represent code. So different parts of this funny looking guy over here represent different
elements different pieces of data. So how much code of a particular type,
this is sd-code. The number of lines of codes
are encoded in the wings, and the number of errors
are encoded over here. The size of this rectangle tells
us the number of changes or the number of children. And then the tail, which is a little bit hard to read,
is also giving us additional information. So these people have
chosen to represent this really sophisticated piece of data
using one kind of interesting glyph. And again, this is an area where we have
to think about integral versus separable. Is the person reading this glyph going
to be able to distinguish these many different variables from each other and
answer questions about them as needed? The takeaways are that glyphs are often
used with multiple retinal variables. Some are separable making it possible
to understand each facet individual. Whereas, some are integral making it very
difficult to distinguish those facets. This is something that you're
going to need to consider based on the tasks that you want to support. Should something support this
kind of separate faceting or not? Okay, and thank you for listening.
