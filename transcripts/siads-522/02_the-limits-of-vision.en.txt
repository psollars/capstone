Welcome back. We're going to continue looking
at perception and cognition and specifically
focus on the limits of vision. This is a really interesting problem for us to understand, because the visual channel
is high bandwidth and very accurate relatively but it's still limited in certain ways. So people have looked at
the amount of bandwidth, the different senses
and our bodies have. Vision is of course the one
with the most bandwidth. So if we count
the number of bits per second that can flow
through visual channels, that is by far the biggest. Then, we have things
like touch and hearing and way down
in this corner, we have taste, with
very little bandwidth. Vision is going to
dominate everything that we do in terms of sensory input. The visual channel is
also primary, that is, its going to take over
everything that you see, because it is high bandwidth, because you've learned to
rely on it in certain ways. So I want you to go off and
go look at this video and then come back and we're going to discuss it for a second. So you saw this great example
of the McGurk effect in action where basically vision is going to take
over what we hear. So what you see dominates over what we hear and
this is this notion that vision is going to be a primary channel that
takes over everything else. The next thing that I want
you to consider is that the visual channel
is highly evolved. You've been evolved to find these and you've evolved to
not get eaten by these, you have not evolved to read a visualization that
looks like this, and certainly not one
that looks like this, and definitely not one
that looks like this. What you have evolved is this good acute sense of being able to distinguish
certain things. So it's possible for you
to tell the difference between the green box
and the brown box, it's a little bit harder to tell the difference between
these two different green boxes. In part, because it's important for you to distinguish between this nice green edible pile of grapes and those rotten bunch of grapes that you probably
would not want to eat. So the green and the
brown are things that you want to
distinguish between, but the green and the green are less critical to your well-being, and so your senses may not
have evolved to do this. This comes up when we think about visualization and the color choices for example that we make. So if you look at
these two gray boxes, you have the one on the left
and the one on the right, and I ask you to say which one is lighter
and which ones darker. This is probably easy
for most of you, not everyone but most of you
can tell the difference. If bring them together, you'll certainly be able
to see that there's a difference between
these two shades of gray. Now, if I give you
these two shades of gray, this is a little bit different, and ask you which is
brighter and darker. A few of you are going to be able to answer this question. Some of you will,
some of you will not. If I bring it closer, you might be able to see this better. But this is on the edge of what's called just-noticeable
difference where it becomes very difficult
for you to be able to tell the difference between
these two shades of gray. This will of course
impact the way we choose things like colors
for our visualizations. Another thing to remember is that we prefer simple explanations. So if I give you
this optical illusion and you're looking at it and I asked
you which is different, are the two shades of gray
for boxes and be different. Most people because
they understand the way 3D and shadows work, will say that they are different, but it might surprise
you then to know that these two shades are
actually the exact same. The way our human brain
interprets these things is mediated by our understanding
of the real world. We understand
how checkerboards work, we understand how shadows work. So that's going to
impact our perception. Here's another example. This is a bunch of dots that I put up on the screen and most of you in looking at this will infer that there's
separate groups. There's a group of
five and a group of three. This is a reasonable thing to understand because
dots that are near each other or objects
that are near each other are usually perceived
to be part of a group. This is all fine and dandy until we think about this in
the context of visualization. So if these were parts of
a point of a scatter plot, this might be problematic. So we'll think about
this in terms of Gestalt psychology
in a little bit. All these things together means that we need to think about how our visualizations work within the constraints of the system. High bandwidth, primary,
evolved, simple explanation, these are all things that will control how it is
that people perceive the information that we put through a visualization system. The takeaways are that
visualization systems are highly constrained and evolved
for a specific purpose. So we will need to think about this very carefully in making decisions about our visualizations.
Thanks for listening.
