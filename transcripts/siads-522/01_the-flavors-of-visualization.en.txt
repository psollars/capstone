Welcome back to Introduction to Information Visualization. I want to talk a little bit about the different flavors of
visualization and what's unique about information
visualization versus some of the alternative. So we're going to go
through a couple of video segments that cover
different alternatives. We're going to use
this particular definition for information
visualization which is the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual
representation of data to amplify cognition. So this is going to be
our starting point. I'm going to break apart
some of these concepts. The first thing that you
should know is that, this definition will actually cover visualizations
that look like this. So this is methane
flame simulation. So they've ignited a fire through a gas or they've
just blown gas through a system and simulated where
the different particles will go and color-coded them applying
this false color on top. So this idea, this is actually a scientific visualization. This is taking a real-world
structure in this case, a gas and a methane flame
like a gas that's been ignited flowing through a system and there color-coding
it in a way. But this is a real-world
visualization that has some false color applied to it so that it's
more readable and more usable for specific
scientific purposes. This is visualization broadly. What we want to do is think about information
visualization with and a little bit of a change
to this definition. We're going to use
the word abstract. So the use of computer-supported, interactive abstract
visual representations of data to amplify cognition. That is we will take things
that we observe about perhaps the real-world and change them into an abstract
representations. So instead of trying to capture all the particles and where they sit relative to each other, we might represent
things by a bar or a pie chart or a scatter plot
or whatever it is. So that's what we
mean by abstract. We've taken real-world data and we found some other
way to represent it, that is not necessarily
appropriate or coherent to the reality like it doesn't look like
the real world. So you'll get things like this when we talk about
information visualization. This is a visualization
of email reply times. So on the x-axis down here, you have the date and each
of these little blips, these little hash marks
represents an email. Whenever an email is
being replied to, what you'll see as an arc. So an arc basically will connect to emails that
are being replied to. So what this visualization will allow you to
explore the patterns, the repetition or the gaps
between email being received, and email being replied to. So this is useful for understanding the way people
interact with each other. This is particularly interesting if you're analyzing social media or the way people collaborate
in an office for example. So this is a
visualization that is specifically targeted
but again it's abstract. We have time on the x-axis. We have these little hash marks
representing emails, and we have these arcs
representing replies. So this is again
an abstract representation of the data. Here's another one. This is another one
by David McCandless, who's a designer data, journalist and artists
simultaneously. This is the amount of text being produced
by different newspaper about different
catastrophic events or events that were believed to be catastrophic at the time. So if you can read closely there's the Y2K
apocalypse over here. SARS quarantine was a virus that they started saying
they thought it was going to be this disaster. Bird flu, vaccine on trial
over linked to autism, battle over violent video games. All these things were basically very localized events
in the press. What the visualization is
showing you is over time, so that again at the x axis is time and you see on
the y-axis the intensity. So the number of
stories covering that particular topic were encoding, that is representing
each story as part of the time series and we're using color to represent
the different kind of article, the different kind of story. What you can see in
this visualization as these rapid fall-offs. So the story becomes prominent
and then it falls off. So David McCandless
had a narrative. So something to tell
you about the way the presses behaving or
the way the public is relating to the press around
these events and drew up this visualization as
a communicative visualization as an abstract
representation of the data. So he counted the number
of stories over time, partition them based on
which thing they were talking about and then made up
this time series visualization, this line chart, so you
can see that kind of data. Our focus in this set
of lectures is mostly going to be
digital onscreen. We're mostly going
to do things that are 2-dimensional and flat. But you should know
that information visualization has previously been used in other scenarios that
are not onscreen and flat. So people have constructed
things like this. This is a model of different kinds of
protein interactions, are very physical 3D structure and you can walk around
and put things in there, so scientists could use this to represent the underlying
data or structures. This is another example, this is a sculpture and
I'll show a video of this some one second,
called dataMorphose. It's a 3D sculpture. Each of these objects
in the middle is like a sailboat sail that moves
depending on what the data is. So they're tracking
different kinds of things like Internet traffic or the number of people visiting the website
or whatever it is. So that is what you see at the bottom encoded
also in this number. Maybe that's the number of visitors to each of
these different websites. The sail will adjust, so it will move in accordance to what
the data is showing. So as new data is arriving, as new people are
coming and visiting, the sail would change its shape, will change its color and so on. So here's a video
of this in action. So the sails again are moving based on whatever is
happening in the real world. They have a number of
different degrees of freedom, the color can change and so on. So this is just
another example of a visualization that is
not two-dimensional. Another situation where people
find visualizations not in two-dimensions to be useful is for the visually
impaired individuals. So imagine being asked to see a visualization when
you can't actually see. So how do we represent data
to those individuals when we're used to things like
line charts or maps and so on. Different people over time have thought about using
3D printers, for example, to actually generate
visualizations that are 3D but as you
can touch them and move your hand across
them to understand the data in the same way that a sighted person
might be able to o. So this is a very
interesting technique for basically enabling
people who might be limited perceptually in terms of visuals to be able to
understand the underlying data. This is a very hard
problem as you might imagine with a lot of data, with a lot of different points, this become very difficult
and challenging, and so people have thought about other ways of doing this, but this is one kind of
interesting approach. The other thing that
is interesting about our definition for
information visualization, is that we will focus on
interactive and dynamic. This will be important for
us for a number of reasons. Most of them will be in regards to what we call boosting
information visualization. So imagine you have a map
like the London Tube map. This is a static visualization, a very famous one that is showing you the different train
tracks in London, the subway and how you can
get from station to station, which train goes through
which station and so on. This is an abstract
representation, it doesn't actually
match to way London actually sits and where these train stations sit
relative to each other. So it looks nice,
it looks pretty, it's very readable but doesn't actually correspond
to the real world. In the real world, you have
a map that looks like this. So this is the London Tube represented as it
actually is where the points corresponding
to the train stations are locked into
the actual coordinates of where they sit
in the real world. So this is interesting and
perhaps useful but there are other things that we can add that sits somewhere between this, which is very nice for way finding and this which
is very nice for understanding where
translations are relative one to the other. There are tasks that
we might want to support with a visualization like this that are not enabled unless we
add interactivity. For example, if I wanted
to know how long or how far I could get from one station to
all or those stations. So I'm sitting let's say at this particular station
over here and I want to know how long it will
take me to arrive at all the other stations
starting at that point. This is not something
that's very easy to calculate looking at
this visualization. I might need to generate many many visualizations to support that question for all the different train
stations that I have. So what interactivity
will allow us to do is basically boosts the number
of tasks we can support, the comparisons we can make. What these people
have done is made a visualization where you
can interact by clicking on a specific train
station and then all the map will
automatically morph so that you're able to see how
long it takes you to get from the this train station
where you are to all others. So in this particular
case the person has clicked on one train station, Plaistow and wants to know how far they can get
within five minutes, within 10 minutes and so on. So these different bands on the circles will
basically indicate how far you can get as you travel outwards from
that specific point. So here's what it looks like when you actually
interact with it. So the person here is going to be clicking on different points
and you'll see the map distorting itself
to answer the question, how far can I get in a certain amount of time
from a particular station. So here we go. So clicking
on one station Baker Street. Click on other Wembley
Park and so on. So this is again very
powerful in that you can answer many many questions
and not just one. You can ask questions about all the different train stations and the visualizations
will automatically morph themselves to
basically answer questions about things relative to the one that
you're focused on. This is why interactivity
is going to be powerful. It will allow you to ask
many many questions of the same dataset without
generating many images, printing out many different
things and so on. You'll be able to
interact directly with the visualization to ask
the questions and get answers. So we won't have a lot
of time and during this particular unit to focus on interaction but I did want
to give you a quick sense of where people can
interact with the data. This is a model called
the interaction model that was presented by Ed Chi, was a famous information
visualization person who's now at Google
and does other things. But he came up with as model
that basically describes how we get from the raw data
to a visual form, and then when the person has
a specific task in mind, how they can interact and in which situations they can
interact with the data. So if we think about
the data coming in, we have the raw data. This might just be
a table that's coming in, maybe it looks
something like this. Then the raw data is perhaps being ordered
into some nice form. So we have some nice headings. It's being structured
in some nice way. Then we might extract
visual structures from this. So we might say map this point to this dot and map this point
to this dot and so on. Then from that we generate views. So maybe we generate a scatter plot and so on
from this particular view. This is different stages
as we go from the raw data to something that the person can actually see. So we have the person
over here that they have a task in mind and they're going from the raw data
to the view. Let's say that the view
that comes to them isn't actually answering
their question. So in which places in this interaction model can they actually change something. So the interaction model
basically says there are different places where one can interact and you interact
in very different ways. So you can interact early on over here by doing
data transformations. So basically,
manipulating the table. So if you have a table
that looks like this, you can manipulate it to maybe be kind of long structure that has a different set of
pieces of data in here. Visual mappings are
where you start to manipulate what this
is transformed into. So maybe you are not going
from dots in a scatter plot, maybe you're going to go
to bars in a bar chart. View transformation will allow you to move from different plots. So a plot that looks like this to a plot that looks like
this or maybe one where you zoom in
to the data to get additional information just on those points that you want. All these things are possible. This is where the person
who's building the visualization
needs to think through how to support interactions
and the best way possible. The takeaways are these. We have a key feature of
information visualization, are the abstractions
and the interactivity. Those are going to be crucial in our definition of
information visualization. We again will focus
on visual forms, but as I mentioned there are
other forms that do exist. We haven't even talked
about things like audio and so on
which are also used as visualization artifacts or ways of building visualizations. Again, we're mostly going to
think about 2D structures, things that you would see
on screen or on paper. With that, thank
you for listening.
