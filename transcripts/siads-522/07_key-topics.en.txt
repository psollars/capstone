Welcome back to Introduction to Information Visualization. I just wanted to
spend a little bit of time talking about
the key topics that we're going to cover in the next video lectures
over the next few weeks. So just to give you
a little bit of a taste of what you're going to expect going into
the next set of lectures. So the key topics for
these four weeks, and some of what you
might see beyond in other pieces of the sequence. So we've talked a little bit
about this before, the way of separating out the problem and
building visualization. So thinking about
the domain layer abstraction technique
in algorithm. This we will come back to
over and over and over again. This will be a theme that
persists across all four weeks. In week 2, we're going to start thinking about
the different kinds of data that we might
want to visualize and specific encoding techniques. So encoding is the notion of
transforming data that we get and choosing
a visual representation of that. So we are going to
transform like this entity called A with a score of one
and to a bar of height one, and this thing with the name of B and a score of five
into this bar over here. That's what we mean by encoding. We're going to learn about
different ways of encoding. Then we're going to think about this notion of expressiveness
and effectiveness. These are going to be
key vocabulary terms that we'll talk
about in the week 2 sequence that will allow
us to make decisions about whether one
visualization technique is better than the other. So there might be different ways of representing the data. We want to be able
to start having a definition for which is better and in what way
is it better. I'll also introduce
you to something called the grammar
of graphics which is a high level technique
that is used to describe what you want to
happen in the visualization. This is something that
will be very useful for implementation for testing
purposes and so on. So it will in fact be the underlying technique
that we will use when implementing visualizations
when programming them through Python
or whatever it is, we're going to be
thinking in this notion of grammar of graphics to do so. In week 3, we'll start to tackle the limits of
the perceptual system. So having identified that
we want to visualize and this notion of expressiveness
and effectiveness, we're going to start
thinking about the way the perceptual
system or so this is a nice example of an optical illusion where
the bars are actually, or each of these
things is actually even sized row but
because of the wave, the little black and white
squares are distributed, it doesn't look that way, right? It looks like these
things are at an angle. These kinds of things are problems for us when we
think about visualization. Because they're going to
impact the way people perceive the things that we put on
screen as graphical marks, and so we'll tackle that
a little bit in week 3. We'll talk about the limits of the perceptual system where
we're able to perfectly and accurately
disentangle what is being encoded and get
the data out of it, we're going to start
thinking about estimates, and we're going to talk
about good encoding. So given different kinds of data, what are the best ways to encode that from a perceptual
perspective? We'll talk about this notion
of Gestalt psychology which is going for
the simplest explanation. This is based on various things
related to evolution. We'll talk about change
blindness and why that's important for animation
and interaction. We'll talk a little bit
about color as well. In week 4, we're going
to tackle design. So popping up a level, having learned something about the underlying perception
and cognition theories. We're going to think about
higher level design principles and when it's actually safe and a good idea to ignore them. We're going to talk about
lying and visualization. Why you shouldn't do it usually, and we're going to talk about
things like aesthetics and things like data-ink which
are high level principles. We'll also cover a little bit the ethics of visualization
as we go through this. Going beyond the sequence
of four weeks, we're going to think about
other kinds of visualizations. One where we have high levels of interactivity or we're thinking about multivariate data sets, we're thinking about
networks, and so on. We're thinking about
things like visualizing texts that are much more complex, but we will always be using the same elements from
these four weeks. The same things that we'll
learn about encoding of a grammar of graphics
about perception. These are going to
be critical as we start to develop
a better understanding. This happens to be
a visualization by the way of Alice in Wonderland, which is a great example of a text visualization
that's highly interactive. We'll also in the future, talk about things
like uncertainty. How to display
uncertain data graphically. This is an example from
MacKay and his colleagues. You can see different ways
of reflecting uncertainty. This is bus arrival times. The main takeaways,
just to recap. We're going in week 2
to figure out things about data and how it relates to information
visualization. Week 3, perception and
cognition where it works, where it doesn't work,
how it will impact us when we design visualization. Week 4, design and some rules
on when to ignore them. With that, thank
you for listening.
