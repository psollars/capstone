Welcome back to our journey
through data models. Now that we've talked about how to represent data nominal, ordinal, or
quantitative, we want to start to think about
drawing marks. So what it is that we're
going to use on the screen or on paper to represent those
different kinds of data sets. So again we have
our puzzle layers, we have in our task, we have
the data inside nominal, ordinal, and so on. We're going to talk
about this mapping now, how to go from those
different kinds of data representations to things
that we see on the screen. So again we have the
mark on the screen, and these are
different kinds of marks. These are graphical
things that we can use to generate
our visualization, we can layer them in
sophisticated ways. But these are the things
that we have to play with. A mark can represent a bunch
of different things, actually two that we care about quite deeply.
One is entities. So things on which we're
collecting the data, whether they're people,
they're companies, they're genes, whatever it is. The mark then represents
the entity, so these are things. They might also represent
the properties of things. So what is the weight
of the person, how many people live in
a country and so on. These are properties
aspects of the entity. They also might be used to
represent relationships, so is friend, is
a parent and so on. So if we think about
a network diagram, something that looks like this. This is a person, this is another person, this mark between them, this line represents
a friendship. Okay. So this is
a specific kind of mark. This one over here
represents person, and this one represents
relationship, is a friend, is a parent is
in the same club and so on. Okay. So those are
the different things that marks can represent. So again and specific examples, the things that could
be Alice and Bob, all males and females, or they could be
properties of things like height of Alice and Bob. So a key part of our decision-making process is thinking about how
we transmit and receive visual
information because encoding is going to be that transformation from
data into a visual signal, which then we expect someone
to be able to look at and read and basically
re-interpret the data from that. So Bertin who's
a very famous philosopher, who thought about
visualization quite deeply, wrote this book called
Semiology of Graphics. His understanding
or his explanation of what visualization looks like in terms of this conveyance of symbols looks
something like this. The sender encodes the
information in a number of signs, that is the graphical marks. The image is then perceived
by the recipient. They visually take in the marks that they
see on the screen, and then they decode
that information from the signs. Of course, that's all mediated by their understanding
and what we're actually encoding in the visual. So let's say we have a set
of quantitative things, and we know that we would
like for the recipient of this information to be able to make the following
inferences that A, B, and C are different things. They're distinguishable entities. That B is something that
sits between A and C, and the B, C that is
the distance between B and C is twice as
long as A and B. A visual representation of that is this particular
visualization. So we have a mark, or we
actually have two marks. We have the plus sign which
represents where that A, B, and C are sitting in space, and we have the label that is
the textual representation. Without that, we
wouldn't be able to read which plus sign corresponds
to which of the A, B, and C. But you can see
from this visualization that we're preserving
that intent that we had. So we had these criteria, the set of thing that
we wanted to express, and we've represented
it in the image. So this is the first thing
that I want for you to be able to
add to your list of vocabulary words around
visualization encoding. We're going to talk
about what it is that the visualization expresses. So let me give you another
specific example around this. Let's say we have
a really simple data set. We have names A, B, and C, and we have some scores
associated with them. What we want to express
is that A is 1, B is 5 and C is 2. We also want to express that B is five times
larger than a, and C as two times larger than A. This visualization
expresses those fact. One can look at
the visualization without having access to the data set but basically infer from reading
it the set of attributes. We can read how high A is, B is, and C is. We can tell that B is
five times as large as A. We can also tell that C is
two times larger than A. Those things can be inferred from looking at this visualization. So these are insights
that I as the analysts had that I want to make sure
you the viewer can see. Now there are other things
that I might want to express, and some of these
might have to do with questions that I
have as an analyst. So if you're thinking
about yourself in the role of the analyst, what you might want to know is what is the
distribution of values, what's the largest value,
what's the smallest. What we want to have
is a visualization that lets us answer
these questions. So these are things that
we want to express on the visualizations from which
we can infer the answer. So again the same
visualization is going to support us being able to
answer these questions. But again, this is
a set of things that we would like for
the visualization to express whether they are on
particular insights that we've already discovered or answers to questions
that we have. So the goal of visualization
again is two fold one. If you're in an analyst role, you have the data and
a set of questions, so the visualization should
express the answers. During a communicative role, you have the data and
a set of insights and the visualization should express the insights to the viewer. Of course, there's
everything in between, so it's not quite true
that you're only being in a communicative role only
being in an analyst role. Oftentimes we're going
to switch between these. The visualization
should then express with answers and insights. So how do we express visually? As we've indicated,
we can manipulate the marks or the visual
properties of the mark. Number 10 in thinking
about this again, this expressiveness and so on started identifying what are called retinal or
visual variables. Retinal variables are basically things that we can change. This is from his
original book in French. These are things that
we can change about the data or the mark in order to convey
specific pieces of data. So we can manipulate
these attributes, we can manipulate where
a mark sits in space, we can manipulate its size, we can manipulate its value
which is its shading, its texture, its color, orientation, shape and so on. There are other things that
we can also manipulate, things like transparency
and blur and so on. These tend to actually not be great as representations of data. So we try to avoid using
those where possible. But when we're doing things like uncertainty
visualization, sometimes transparency and blur is useful for those kinds
of data sets. So we will encode a level of uncertainty using
the level of transparency, but these are things
that we can manipulate. To determine which encoding
is the best one, we're again going to
look at this mapping between the task of an data
to the mark in the image, and thankfully there
have been a lot of psychology or perceptual
experiments that have told us where things sit in the spectrum for more
accurate to less accurate. So we have this
hierarchy of things, and we'll talk about
this more where position and length are
really, really accurate. So it's possible to
tell the difference between the size of this bar
and the size of this bar. If I ask you how much bigger one is relative to the other, you're going to be
quite good at that. But things like area
and volume and color and density tend to
be less accurate. So we'll see why that
is in future lectures. But people have done this across all the different
kinds of data. So quantitative data sets, we know that position
is better than length, length is better than angle, angle is better than
slope and so on. Ordinal we put position
above density, above color saturation and so on. Nominal, we have position, color hue and so on again. So looking at this diagram, what you're going to be
able to notice is that length while it's
great for quantitative is not so great for ordinal and is also not so
great for nominal. So that's what these lines
in between are telling us. These gray boxes down here, tells us that this is not an appropriate way of encoding
particular data sets. So we don't want to
use containment or shape to quantitative things. It's really hard for someone
to tell us the difference between a circle and
a square, right? So if this was
a quantitative variable, this meant 5 and this meant 2. It's not really possible
to imagine a set of shapes that are going to be great for this particular task, like how much bigger this
is relative to this. So this is a diagram that reproduce from
a paper by Jock Mackinlay, and we're going to talk
about this in a second. He built this as a way of
identifying for a computer, for a program, a way of automatically generating the right kinds of
visualizations. So we're going to see
how to use this in practice and what's called the
APT algorithm in a second. But before that, just
a quick takeaways, the marks and the properties of marks or the things
that we can manipulate as
these process of encoding. We are going to have to
make this decision about whether the data is nominal,
ordinal, or quantitative. But then we can rely on things like this diagram in order to figure out the best way
to represent those. So we're going to determine
what needs to be expressed, and from that, we're
then going to decide which marks to put on
the screen and how to put them. The psychology and
perceptual experiments will then tell us
which to pick and why. With that, thanks for listening.
