Welcome back. We're going to continue our discussion a little bit about the life factor
as I call it Part 2, but this is going to be
about graphical integrity. It's another idea put
out by Edward Tufte. Again, there will be
some caveats to this, but it's generally a good idea to follow these principles
of graphic integrity. So what does it mean
to have integrity when we talk about charts
and visualizations? There are basic questions that we believe most people
should be able to answer, such as where's the baseline, what's the scale,
what's the context. So being informative about those choices that we
make and readability, showing people where the
baseline is or allowing them to understand that maybe
the baseline isn't a zero, that's going to be important. So we're going to try to provide accurate legends and things
like that as we will see, but there are other extensions to these that are going
to be important. So let me give you
a few different things. Proportionality,
which is related to our first discussion
of life factors, is that the numbers on
the drawing surface should be proportional to
the numerical quantities. What we mean by that is
that if you have a set of data like let's say you have
the numbers 1, 5, and 10, and you choose to represent
that as a line so the encoding for
the data is basic lines, the line link for
one should be five, sorry the line length
for five should be five times as one, and the line length for 10 should be twice as much as five. So this should be a 5x difference between the five and the one, and there should be a 2x
difference between the 10 and 5. So these things are
proportional in the encoding, the size, the length of the lines relative to the actual
differences in the data. So again, this refers to the original idea
of the life factor. So the proportionality is
going to be critical here. The other thing that we
want to make sure to have good graphical
integrity is that we're accurately
explaining everything that we can about the data
that we think is important. This is important both for
communicative purposes, but also when you're an analyst and are trying
to understand the data, you as the person interpreting the data want to be
able to understand what the underlying system has done, and so it's going to
be important to think about whether it's showing
you this information or not. If you look at this
visualization on the right, you see a pretty good job of them annotating the data and
labeling things clearly. You see notes about how
the data was normalized, you see things like the source, you see the visualization
itself with a call-out to when
the recession happened. This is the key point
in the article and so they're calling it
out making it salient. You also see that they've identified key points to look at that they
think are important. There's some discussion,
there's good titles, but the axes are
labeled properly. So everything here is readable if I take away all my
notation on top of it. So this is a nice example
were labeling is clear, concise and so on and is actually understandable
as visualization. So it has good integrity
in that case. The other thing that is often believed when
we're focusing on chart integrity or
graphical integrity is that we should
focus on the data, so we shouldn't be showing off in terms of design
variations like making things interesting
visually instead of focusing on the data. There will be caveats
to this as we'll discuss later when we
talk about Chartjunk, but the main notion is that you should avoid
things like this, where you're being clever about the way that you're
encoding that data. I mean, in this case,
is different figures, dressed in the local costume
of the country, representing the size of
whatever data this is, using the size of the figures. So this is very
visually appealing, it's perhaps engaging and
that might have its uses, but as a way of encoding data, it might not have
great graphical integrity listed in the mind of Tufte. The other thing that we
often talk about when we talk about graphical
integrity is normalization. This is going to be
important when we have time-varying things like
money or population units. So for example, bread loaves cost very different amounts
in 1930 versus 2013, but this reflects in some sense inflation and not necessarily anything
about the bread. So bread was not necessarily
cheaper in 1930s relative to 2013 once you consider how much income was
for different individuals. So this is a case where we
have to normalize the data, and people who do this correctly will often indicate this. So this is a visualization
of crude oil prices where they're trying to show
different changes in time, and in this case, they've
normalized the data. So this is actually
a good representations that we actually see how these things have actually varied versus not. So as you can see over here
this little annotation, deflated using the consumer
price index for the US. It's always money of the day. So you can actually get
a good sense of whether this was an important change or
a non-important change once you understood things like inflation. This also comes into play when we talk about things
like population. So this is a map
visualization where the US population density
is encoded using the color. So more dense areas are encoded with these
darker shades of red. Now, of course, what
happens when you look at other things distributed
geographically, what happens is it doesn't
actually matter what the data is because so many people
live in a certain place. If we eliminated this title, this could equally well be
a visualization of people with colds or it could be the number of readers
of magazines. Because there's
so many people who live in a particular county, that's going to
overwhelm anything else. So it's often going
to be important to normalize by the number of people who live in
a particular thing. So we want to know the readers
of magazines per capita, that is per person living
in that particular county. This is going to be critical for the person trying to
understand the map; otherwise, we're always going to be showing the same map because this
is where most people live, and so that no matter
what situation it is, that's where most of
the highlighting is going to happen regardless
of what data it is that we're
visualizing just because that's the way geographical
distribution happens. So, again, normalization,
it's going to be critical here to show the interesting features that are properties of the county and not properties of the population of large counties
versus small counties. We're also going to try
and limit the number of retinal variables so the
information-carrying variable. So we want to use one dimension when we have
one-dimensional data. So we're just trying to encode the price per barrels of oil. We're going to just try
and use lines directly. So ideally, we would just
draw a bar chart instead of these fancy barrels because the barrels are encoding
multiple things. They're encoding the x, the y, and the z-axis because the barrels
are three-dimensional. We often don't want to have
that in our visualization. We want to use one for one. Now, where does this matter, where might we have
a caveat to this. In some cases we might have different
device types like we have color printers or
color-blindness and there, we might not want to use
just a single variable. So in this case we're
just using color to differentiate between
these two different color types, but this will not work if you're colorblind or if your device doesn't support color printing. In this case, we might want
to have something else. So using only one encoding
whether it's just color or whether it's just shape, might not be ideal. What we might want to do is both things because that's
where we're going to have the advantage of dual coding or most people will be
able to read better, but this will also support those people who are printing on black and white printers, and those people who
have colorblindness. So in this case, we have three pieces of data
but we're using four different things
to encode them, x position, y position, color and shape, are
all being used here. So we're breaking the
graphical integrity discussion that Tufte would push for, Okay? So ideally, we should
only have three things, shape or color, but
we're choosing here to use four for three
different variables. The next thing that we want
to talk about is context. So Graphics must not quote
data out of context. This is a pretty
good rule generally. So let's say we have
this data and I tell you that
something had a value 325 in 1955 and 275 in 1956. Let's say this is
the number of deaths due to accidents and I'm trying to make an argument
about a changed from 1955 to 1966. So we have accidents before
and accidents after it. If I show you this visualization
that looks like this, you might from that interpret that, this was a good change. Something happened
between those two years that decreased
the number of accidents. But what this is
lacking is context. What we don't know is if this particular piece of
data that I'm showing you, is part of a much more
complicated story. Maybe the story looked
like something like this, where in fact
the change that we made to the roadways or seat belt
laws or whatever it is, actually led to
this really nice decrease in the number of fatal accidents. Or maybe it looked like this, for some reason there
was a blip and it went up in the year 1954 but
we're not seeing it, and then went down
from 1955 to 1956. Or maybe it looks like this, like it's changing over time and this oscillating way, okay? We don't know if we
don't show the context. So the reality of
the situation is being masked from the reader in
a way that's damaging perhaps. Now, context can be
a double edge sword. So in this example, if we take things like
the average global temperature, so this is climate
change over time. If we rescale the data we're showing the context in
this particular way, going all the way from
zero to a 110 degrees, and we're showing the change from the pre 1900s to about 2019. It looks pretty flat, right? So this is a trick that
some people use in order to display this information
to show that, that doesn't look like there's
actually a lot of changes, but it's actually
the small changes here that are really critical. So the things that
are happening at the fine level between these two different sets
of degrees like 55 degrees and 65 degrees or 55 and 60 are actually
the important things. So by choosing to show
context in this way, we're actually hiding
the important changes in the data that's being masked by introducing
this additional context. Context In this case
doesn't actually matter. Here's a few other examples
of misuse and abuse of data, in this case they're doing
a bunch of broken things. So if you look at the
visualization just for a second, see if you can already identify what's the problem with it. So if we look at the picture
in a little bit more detail, we look at the different level. So this is unemployment rates
under Obama at the time. So we have a different
dates and we have the different levels
ranging from 8-10 percent. If I pull out this visualization and annotate it with
additional stuff, what you see is
interesting is that 8.8 is actually below 8.6. So what we're seeing
something a little bit weird about this data already, and 9.0 percent is actually at the same level as 8.6 percent. So something is a little busted
about this data already. What happens if we pull
out the context and we show the data encoded
in the proper way, we're seeing a much
different visualization, when we visualize the real data, in a way that is consistent
with graphical integrity. So part of this might have
been just a natural mistake, but perhaps this was intentional. So I wanted to show you
the two different kinds of ways of visualizing this data. The one on the right and the
one on the left which is actually the true representation
of the encoding. So we would prefer under the notion of
graphical integrity, to use the one on the left. Here's another example. This is cost of gas and
what they're choosing to show here is a few time-points, so last year, last week, and current which is a little bit of a weird thing already, just split up data in this way. But this is the way
they've chosen to represent the data and you can see this change over
time in the data. So what you might infer from this is that gas prices are going up. So last year was low
at $3 and 17 cents, last week it was $3 and 51 cents, and now it's jumped at $3
and 57 cents and that's bad. What's lacking in here
as again context. If we actually look at the data
for the same time period, and we're actually showing
all the different time points, we actually see a lot more
fluctuation happening, and the levels are
actually staying relatively the same
from the beginning, the early February 2011 to
February 2012 like we have it. We went up then we
went down and so on. We're also showing
here are the prices, both for national average wholesale and crude
simultaneously, so it's easier to
compare different points of pricing in the gas station. So with that additional
context what we see, is this very simple story of gas prices going up is
not actually accurate. Here's another example
and hopefully this one's quite obvious about
what's wrong with it. You see different
bar charts here for a survey about how concerned people are about the Zika virus. Somehow, somewhat has
a bar length 28 percent, whereas not at all which is only 13 percent has
this really high bar. This is clearly not
the right encoding of this data. Perhaps they wanted to
tell a certain story that most people are not
concerned about Zika, but this is not actually correct. Very few people are not at
all concerned about Zika, that is, most people
have some concerns. So what are the takeaways from this notion of
graphical integrity? There are lots of rules
on graphical integrity. Something like context including
normalization is good. Things like 1-to-1 mapping of
data to variables is good, but there are caveats
to each of these. The caveat for the first is
that context in the case of climate change one can
be a double-edged sword, there we're introducing
context inappropriately. Also with a 1-to-1 encoding, things like having changed colorblind users or
black and white printers, make it important to
use double encoding and not just the 1-to-1 mapping
of data to variables. All right. With that,
thank you for listening.
