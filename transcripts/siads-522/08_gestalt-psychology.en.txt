Welcome back. We're going to continue on our journey
through perception and cognition right now thinking about something called
Gestalt psychology Gestalt psychology is something that's really interesting
basically tells us that the simplest and most stable interpretations
are the ones that are favored. This is called the law of prognost, but we're going to see specific
examples of this in one second. But again, remember that our brains
have evolved in a certain way and we like really simple explanations in
terms of what it is that we're seeing the most famous example in this space. This one. So if you're looking at this particular
diagram that we put up on the screen you might recognize this as
the face in vase experiment. So most people when looking at this
will first see the vase that is because the faces look like background. Okay.
So the thing that's figure the thing that's in the foreground
will become most apparent and that's usually the thing
that you'll detect first. If I draw frame around this the face
has become the foreground object and so most people will detect the faces
over the vase in this particular version of the visual
Here's another example. If I asked you to look at these two
different diagrams, they both have the same number of dots but I ask you to
think about whether you're seeing rows or columns in each of these most people
when looking will see columns in the first one and
we'll see rows in the second one and that's because we have this notion of
proximity where dots or anything that's close to each other will be treated
together like as if it was a unit so doc. That are sitting close to each other
will be preferred as a kind of unit of information in this case
a column versus in this case. They're closer in the other direction. And so you're going to prefer
an explanation that says call rows instead of columns for
the one on the right. So if we look at this
visualization over here, this is a network diagram where each
of the dots represents a gene and each of the lines that are connected them
is a interaction between the genes so yellow dots genes in Her
actions either these red or blue lines if you start
this visualization for a little while what you might start to
detect as these kinds of striations. And your brain is going to tell you these
things are points that are related to each other in some way. It happens to be that this is not actually
any kind of real interesting signal. This just happens to be a property of
this visualization technique that it puts the points in this way that puts
them in these little striated little lines going up and down and so
you're going to read something from this visualization that is actually
just an artifact of the algorithm. So this is an example of where proximity The technique is going to
do the wrong thing for us. So again, we have this notion of proximity
The Columns the rows and when applied to this visualization, we're going to
see something that isn't actually there. Another related ideas this
notion of similarity. And again, if I asked you to look
at this particular image and tell me whether you see rows and columns
most people are going to see columns because we're going to prefer
an explanation of that says things that are similar to each other should
belong to the same group here. The spacing is equal. So there's not a difference between the
spacing either horizontally or vertically, but you're going to read all the circles
in the one column as being together and all the squares in other. Holmes is being together. This is totally rational. This is what you might
expect in the real world. A related idea is something
called connectedness. Now, I want you to look at this visual. I'm going to show you
four different ones and I want you to think about whether
you're seeing rows and columns. And the first one you're reading this and
you're probably seeing a bunch of columns. Okay, this is proximity. So we're going to write down column
C in this one because of similarity. You're sorry. This one is Rose. And in this one you're going to probably
be seeing columns because of similarity and this one you're going to be seeing. Again, because of similarity and this one
columns again because of similarities. So now we have Rose in the first one and
three instances of columns. Now, I'm going to draw a subtle
thing on top of all of these which will change all your
understanding of the data. So drawing these little lines on
Top This notion of connectedness things that are connected
should become grouped together our interpretation of the data
changes dramatically. So the thing that was a row
in the upper corner over here now looks like a column
this one looks like a row. This one looks like a row and this one for
most people looks like a row. Okay.
So this little subtle connection which makes sense in the real world things
that are connected belong together will dominate over the proximity or
similarity arguments. Another interesting Gestalt
principles is notion of continuation. If you're looking at this
particular image over here, you have these lines
you have these two end. For end points a b c and d and if I ask
you to think about what are the segment's like, how does it how to think about
breaking this particular image apart? Most people will tend towards an
explanation that looks like this this red line connecting points A and B and
this blue line connecting points C and D. This is reasonable. This is the way the world Works things
of the don't have like the sudden weird changes in the way the shape flows. So this is a different interpretation so
we could have this red Connection between a and c and
this blue connection between B and D. But you're going to prefer in most cases
the interpretation where you have this smooth continuation rather than these
weird breakpoints in the middle. The principle of closure is
an interesting one as well. If you're looking at this particular
image, you can thinking about what you're seeing most people like to imagine that
these squares are actually squares and continue. So if you're looking at it,
let's draw this most people will interpret this is a unit this is a unit and
this is a unit because it makes sense to imagine these Lines continuing
and basically closing off the image. Okay, so that is an interpretation
that you will prefer most cases looking at
this particular image. Now if I remove these little lines
at the top and the bottom and I just show you the bars. Your interpretation is going to change the
thing that before you perceived as a unit. So this particular Square
it will no longer look like a unit when those little lines those
continuation and closure lines go away. So now we're going to
treat this as a unit. This is a unit. This is a unit and proximity-based. We here will dominate so
the things that were connected before okay become disconnected when
those closure lines go away. Closure is an interesting because we
understand it again relative to the way that things work in the real world. So if you're looking at this particular
image and you're thinking how does this circle sit relative to the rectangle
you're going to understand or believe that there's some continuation
right that goes behind the circle but that doesn't need to be the case and certainly
not with visualization with real data. We might have something
that's actually like this. Okay.
So your I might be fooled in your brain might be fooled because you
understand the A real lions and real things work again in the real world,
but that doesn't necessarily mean that they work that way when it comes to
data last one to think about is this notion of smallness if I have
a particular diagram over here, you have one on the left and one on
the right and you have these two different kinds of crosses inside people tend to
prefer a small things as being units. And so in the one on the left,
you're going to usually see this this cross over here that's going along the
diagonals and on the right you're going to see this cross that's going up and down
in this case where there's a lot of those kind of equivalence between these like
there's not one that's smaller or larger. You're going to be able to switch back and forth between these
different interpretations. Yeah, that's going to be something that
your brain can do because it's not clear that one thing is small and
obvious relative to the others. The notion of surrounding this
is another interesting one. If you look at this particular image,
and I asked you what do you see? Well most people look at and understand this to be is a bunch of these
weird little icons these little glyph. So you have this thing over here
you have this thing this thing and this thing as these different
separate entities and this is totally reasonable again
because of this foreground and background in this notion of surrounding
us the thing that's surrounding this white space that's surrounding these
black sort of Lifts that you see, but if I change this a little bit now
you can see what's actually there. Okay. So the thing that was hard to read because
of this notion of surrounding us becomes easier to read when I create
this obvious difference. Okay.
So this is something that we're going to think about what it is that we're showing
relative to the background how it is that things are surrounding the signal
that we want to portray. A related notion is one of symmetry if
I show this particular image, there are multiple ways one could interpret this
but most people will prefer not this one. They'll prefer this one. Okay.
The thing that is symmetric will be the preferred foreground image. There's nothing in here that's telling
you what's foreground or background, but you're going to read these two different
Towers probably as chess pieces rather than this. Have the notion of symmetry as
being preferable because that is how we see most things in the real world. We see more things that look symmetric
like this then things that look like this. So just to recall the simplest and most
stable interpretations are the ones that are favored and this applies to all
the Gestalt principles that we've seen so far and will continue to use when
we think about visualizations. The takeaways is that Gestalt
psychology indicates that we focus on these simple explanations,
there's lots of specific laws and principles that have been studied
extensively around those and they can be used to our
advantage as we'll see later on.
