Interviewing is a little bit like
detective work, in that you're trying to get your interview participants to
tell you information that either they may not realize you need to know or
that you may not even know that they had. When I was growing up one of my
favorite television detectives was person by the name of Columbo. And detective Columbo was interesting
in that he always wore kind of frumpy clothing. He was absent minded and he didn't seem
like he always knew what was going on. But one of the most interesting
things was his interviewing style. In particular, his trademark was that
after he had spoken with somebody, usually the suspect and
he had gone down to the point where they seem to think okay,
he was about to walk away. And right at the end he would
say just one more thing. And he would ask a question that often
turned out to be the critical bit of information, provide the critical
bit of information that he needed to tie all of the things
together in his case. Now interviewing is both a science and
an art. And in this course, you're going to learn
most of the part that is a little bit more scripted, that's more of the science. But it's also important to realize that
there's an art element of interviewing that you'll have to figure out yourself
through practicing interviews, and trying out the different
things that you're hearing. In this particular segment, we will
talk about the questions that actually should go into the body of
your interview protocol. And you can think of the process of
coming through these questions as being preparation for
the actual interviews themselves. They'll help you kind of think through
the topic background that you need to think through the questions
that you're going to ask and exactly what flow you're going to
use during the interview themselves. As I mentioned there are different
components in an interview protocol. And today again, we're going to
be focusing on the questions. So talking about the key questions that
you're asking in an interview protocol. These are the big questions
that should be trying to get at the main questions that you want to
ask your interview participants. These key questions should be generally
speaking, open ended, meaning that they should ask questions that can't
easily be answered in short answers. You want to ask questions like,
can you tell me about such and such? Or why do you believe that so
and so is the situation? Or how do they do a particular thing? Other open-ended questions you're
going to ask include things like, why do you think that is? Or just tell me more the situation. Close-ended questions on the other hand
are questions that somebody could answer, with a very short answer like
how often do you do something? Or do you believe that x is true. These are all questions that you can
answer with a number, or with a yes or no. And they don't provide the kind
of answer that you're looking for in most interviews. And they also don't open up the interview
participant to keep talking, which is really what you ultimately want. Another kind of category of way
to think about the different key questions is whether they're
asking specific concrete questions or whether they're talking about
abstract or generalized ideas. One way to think about
the interview process is that you're going to be seeking
specific, concrete data from which you as the researcher are going to kind of
find abstract generalized ideas. It really shouldn't be the job of
the interview participant to come up with these abstractions. Partly because it turns
out that psychologically, people often generalize in
ways that are not correct. They tend to be much more factually
accurate when they stick to specific facts and specific concrete instances. And then the other, of course, is that the
way that they generalize or abstract ideas might not be the way that makes the most
sense for you as the researcher. So again, key questions that
you might want to ask, but that are going after specific
concrete information are things like, tell me about the last time
that you did something. You can tell about this particular
prompt that, because you're associating the question with a particular instance, that it's more likely to
elicit a concrete response. People will tell you about the last time
they did something rather than about the general case when they
did that exact thing. Or you can ask, can you think of
a specific instance when such and such a thing happened? And can you tell me more about that? In contrast, abstract generalized
questions will use words like normally or typically, and try to get at
the abstracted generalization. And again, that's your job as
the researcher to come up with. It's not the job of the interview participant. Abstracted questions aren't
necessarily bad questions, but you do want to be sure that you're asking
for enough specific, concrete items so that you're not just getting abstracted
answers from your interview participants. Another thing to think about when you're
asking questions is that they should be non-leading and without a judgement. What does that mean? It means that you don't want
to lead your participants into thinking that you are looking for
a particular answer. You want to try to get the responses in
as neutral a form as possible so that you hear more about what they think and less
about what you're expecting them to think. Some ways of asking non-leading
questions or, for example, what explanation do you prefer? Rather than saying, do you believe that
x is true or that y is more true than z? Or you could ask,
why do you think that happened? Without saying do you think it
was a problem that x happened? Because that suggests that maybe you're
thinking that it might be a problem that you're adding some
judgment to the situation. And that can cause
the interview participant to think that you're expecting
a certain kind of answer. Or you can ask,
how did you think about the problem? Instead of asking, why didn't
you consider this as a solution? Because again,
that sounds a little bit accusatory and they might feel like they
need to defend themselves, rather than tell you exactly
what the actual situation was. Finally, once you have a good set of
key questions, you're going to want to think about what order to put them and
how they should flow together. Again, your goal during the interview,
it's actually to try to create some kind of a conversation in which the interview
participant is talking freely about the topics that you're interested
in hearing from them about. You want to cluster related questions
together so that the interview participant doesn't have to keep changing what the
frame of mind that they're speaking with. You'll also want to have, within each
cluster, the questions arranged in some kind of meaningful order. Sometimes it might be
a chronological order. Sometimes it might have
some narrative order, might go from broader questions to
narrow questions or vice versa. But whatever it is, having a little
bit of an order helps the interview participant understand what
you're trying to get at. And then once you have these
clusters of questions, you'll want to arrange them
in a meaningful order, so that the overall interview protocol
itself also makes some sense. And then one trick that is often useful
is to kind of save questions that you anticipate being sensitive
towards the end. So that you can get as much information as
possible before you get to the point where the interview participant might say, Well, I'm not sure I want to
answer that question. Maybe I'd like to end this
interview at this point. So saving sensitive questions towards
the end allows you to get as much information as possible
while hopefully still having those sensitive questions
answered as well. Once you have the main questions,
you're also going to want to include a bunch of follow up questions
after each of the main questions. These follow up questions can be
a little bit more closed ended, they can be a little bit shorter,
they can sometimes lead. The goal in these follow up questions is
to make sure that you're getting all of the information you need for
each key question. Sometimes you'll have interview
participants who don't say much even when you ask them an open ended question. And you want to make sure that even
with interview participants like that, that you're able to get all of
the information that you need. Some follow up questions that
you might want to ask are just simple things like, why? Why did you do that? Why did you think that? Or how did that happen? Sometimes you might want to have
prompt specific issues such as, did you think about x kind of bias or
y kind of bias? Did you think about such and such a trend? Or did you expect to
find something like this? And note that these are all
leading questions to an extent but because their follow up questions
you would only ask them if you're not getting satisfactory responses
from your interview participant. Sometimes it's helpful to ask questions,
the same question or same class of questions over and
over again. And so you can always repeat and you can
say you told me about the last time that such an event happened, could you tell me
about the time before that, and so on. Again, within each,
under each, main question, you'll also want to think about
the order of the follow up questions. And you will almost certainly not ask all
of the follow up questions but they're useful to have so that you've thought
through them at least once yourself. Some final thoughts about what should go
into the question portion of protocol. Again the protocol itself is meant for
preparation for you, as well as a guide
during the interview. You will usually take the protocol
with you in a printed form so that you have the questions
in front of you. But ideally, you will have
memorized most of the questions and the overall flow of the protocol before
you actually go and interview so that you don't really have to
refer to the protocol itself. An ideal situation that the interview
protocol is just being used as a kind of mnemonic aid for you so
that occasionally you can look down if you feel like you've lost
track of where the interview is. And remember, again that you won't read all of the
protocol questions one after the other. What you're aiming for is a kind of
conversational style where the interview participant feels at ease, has feel some
rapport with you is willing to volunteer information even if you might
not have specifically asked. You'll find in the module handout that
there's more information both about how to conduct interviews,
how to write interview protocols, and how to think of the overall process
of conducting an interview.
