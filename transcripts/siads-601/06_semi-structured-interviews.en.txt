Now we're going to get into
the main content of this course. And the first topic is
semi-structured interviews. So in the same way with
quantitative data analysis, somebody has to collect the data. In the case of qualitative research,
the way you collect data can vary. But one of the most common ways to
collect data is through interviews. Now, there are different
kinds of interviews that qualitative researchers use. And in this particular course we'll
go over semi-structured interviews. They're probably the most
widely used methodology for doing interviews in qualitative research. Now, of course, interviews can be by
group, or via individual, one-to-one. They can be remote, possibly via phone,
or teleconference, or of course, they can be in-person. And then the degree of structure
of the interview can vary. So it can be very structured
as in a questionnaire. It can be semi-structured and we'll
talk more about that in this segment. Or they can be unstructured, where you really just have a freeform open
conversation about a particular topic. In this segment, and in this course, we'll be focusing on individual
interviews that you conduct one-to-one. In-person ideally, although to the extent
that that might not be possible in some of your projects, it's fine if it has
to be by phone, or by teleconference. But I will say that in general, there's a very different vibe that happens
when you have a interview in-person. It's much more conducive to get
establishing rapport with the person and actually getting very
good qualitative data. And then of course, this style of
interviewing is semi-structured. And I'll talk a little bit more
about what exactly that means. So in a semi-structured interview, one of
the key issues is that you want to strike a balance between the, you as
the researcher directing the questions and the focus of the interview. But also being open to responses
that you might not expect. And to do the latter, you really want to
maintain a kind of conversational style with the interview participant. You want to put them at ease, really try to speak to them as if it was
just a regular conversation you were having where you're just kind of
picking their brain for information. For the purposes of
a semi-structured interview, you would have an interview protocol. And in a later segment, we'll discuss exactly how to
prepare a interview protocol. But the interview protocol basically is
a series of questions and an outline for how you want the interview to proceed. Now even though you have these series of
questions in a semi-structured interview, you would not actually ask the questions, one after the other in
a kind of machine gun style, like you might do in a questionnaire.
Instead, you just use it as a guide, and anytime you hear the interview
participants say something interesting, that's relevant to your overall purpose, you would actually deviate from the script
and just keep following up until you're satisfied that you heard everything
that you wanted to about that point. Because you might do this
multiple times in the interview. Again, you won't follow
the interview protocol exactly. Also, depending on what the interview
participants says you might actually skip sections, you might decide to go back to
a section of your interview protocol. And you might even ask questions
that aren't on the protocol at all. And so in a semi-structured interview,
the basic expectation is that you'll have a rough sense for
what the interview will be about. But frequently, you'll go off script. Now there are some parameters
that you should try to aim for. These are guidelines more than
they are hard, rigid constraints. As you heard already, to some extent the
people that you want to interview for the data set project are people like
the people who might have commissioned the data set. People who might be
tasked with analyzing it. People who might have contextual knowledge
about the content of the data set, even if they don't have direct
knowledge of the data set itself. Or people who might have contributed to
the data in some way, shape, or form. Basically, anybody who cares about
the information that might be contained in the data set. And who might have some insight
into what kinds of trends and patterns you might find. Now, another thing to think about
is where to conduct your interview. And again, there is an ideal situation
which is where you would conduct the interview in an environment where
the data is most relevant to the person. For example, if it's a data set that is
collected in a formal work environment or it would be analysed in
a formal work environment, you'd probably like to have the interview
in your interview participants' office somewhere where they would most likely be
doing work that's relevant to the data. If that's not possible for some reason, it's perfectly okay to have
the interview in a neutral location. Again, ideally in-person rather than the
third option, which is to do it remotely, by phone or teleconference. Finally, one thing to think about
is when to conduct interviews. For the purposes of the course,
you definitely want to have them happen within about the second or
third week of the course. Again, please see the written text
assignment for the details of that. They should, of course happen at
a mutually convenient time for you and the interview participant. And then finally, it's helpful if you
conduct interviews at a time when the participant would normally be thinking
about things relevant to the data. So again, during work hours, if it's
something relevant to somebody's work, or during possibly the evening, if it's a topic that's more
relevant to their evening habits. And the reason for this is people tend
to have rhythms in the, what they pay attention what they think about. And if you're there at a time when they
would most likely be thinking about the topic that's most conducive to the
kinds of responses that you're seeking.
