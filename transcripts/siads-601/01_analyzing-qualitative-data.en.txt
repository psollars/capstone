This week, we're going to be talking
about analyzing qualitative data. And actually this slide deck, even though it's called analyzing
qualitative data is actually going to be just about what the underlying concept
is behind analyzing qualitative data. So take a look at these colored shapes and imagine how you would go about
trying to memorize these items. I'll give you a few
seconds to think about it. And if you want, you can even start trying
to memorize exactly what the different colors and shapes are. Okay, now if you are thinking about this
then one of the things that you probably notice is that some of
the shapes are repeating and some of the colors are repeating. And so
if you can somehow put them all together, it's much easier to remember exactly how
many of which color shapes there are. So for example, one thing you could do
is start by clustering these shapes, for example by color. And already you can see there's a little
bit more order to the actual shapes and colors and so
it's a little bit easier to remember. Now if you cluster again into
the different shapes, then again, you can see that it's
even easier to look at. For example, you can immediately
see that there are four red discs, one blue disk and so on. Finally, if you sort them in an order that
seems to make sense, then you'll find that there's an even easier way to think about
all of these different shapes of colors. So for example, we can see that there
are three of each of the shapes of disks, triangles and squares that are in purple. If you see the other colors, what you
find is that there are four red disks, four blue triangles and
four green squares. And then of every other possible shape,
color combination, there's basically just one. Now if you think about it this way, then
all of those initial colored shapes that you needed to remember
are much easier to remember. In fact, if you think about it, you will
probably be able to remember them today and other than minor mistakes,
you might be able to remember this for several weeks or even for
much longer than that. As opposed to trying to remember each
of these shapes in their, initially, apparently random position. So what I'm going to suggest is that in
qualitative data analysis as well as other kinds of data analysis,
including quantitative, something like this process is what is
underlying the attempt to understand data. So the world of course is full of data. You can't possibly remember it all. There's just way too much. And so what do we do as a way to both
condense that data and understand it is we cluster it, sorted it, look for patterns,
and then relate things to each other. And by doing this, you end up condensing the immense
amount of data into a smaller amount. This is true both in the qualitative
analysis technique you'll learn in the next segment, and also,
in quantitative data analysis. So for example, when you do a regression,
you can think of it as finding a way to condense all of the information that's
contained in a bunch of data points. And by, let's say, representing them as a
single line finding an easier way to think about what those data
points actually represent. I think of condensing as
a kind of understanding and understanding is a key
part of intelligence. So if you really understand
this idea clustering, sorting, finding patterns and so on,
I would suggest that it actually helps to contribute to very intelligent
analysis of all kinds of data. Now in the next segment we'll
learn about affinity walls, which are one kind of
qualitative data analysis. And you'll see as we go through it
that what's underlying get is exactly this sort of clustering, sorting,
and finding of patterns.
