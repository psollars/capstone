Let's go a little bit deeper into what
qualitative research is really all about. So again, think back to this example
I gave, where maybe the local police department has dumped a bunch of data on
you about traffic stops and citations. And as often happens with data scientists,
the people who give you data might just assume that you can work your
magic and come up with all kinds of interesting analyses without
knowing much more about the situation. Of course, we all know that
that's not quite the case. Quantitative research, of course, is very
good at putting numbers to phenomena, revealing all kinds of statistical
trends and patterns, and confirming or rejecting hypotheses. But quantitative research is
not necessarily as good at incorporating non-numerical,
heterogeneous data. In fact, you could argue that it's very
difficult to do that unless you come up with ways to quantify that data. Also, oftentimes the data that you
have to work with has blind spots. There is data that
hasn't been collected or that should have been collected, but
which you don't have access to. And then certain kinds of
hypothesis generation are also very difficult through
quantitative means alone. And that's where a qualitative
methodology can be extremely helpful. So for example, if you wanted to know, just even before you begin
your quantitative analysis, what kinds of trends in the police
data matter more to residents? Or is the police department concerned
about some form of bias that maybe they want you to look into? Or possibly,
if they know that there is bias, how might bias actually
creep into officers' work? These are all questions that,
if you knew in advance, and you knew that somebody
was interested in them, then it would help guide your
quantitative data analysis as well. And so one thing that qualitative research
methodologies are very useful is actually getting answers to exactly
these kinds of questions. So qualitative research is, of course, dealing with all kinds of data,
not strictly non-numerical. In fact, qualitative research can also
incorporate numerical data as well. But it's very good at handling
heterogeneous data sources. Qualitative research also often involves
direct interaction with the people or the context that are relevant
to a particular problem. And it results in very
rich information and detail that is very hard
to get purely numerically. Again, some of its strengths are rich,
in-depth information, that you can cover a broad range of
things and topics relatively quickly. It's also very flexible to whatever access
you have to people or data or information. And then one of the great things
about qualitative research for the sake of data scientists is that
it's very good at hypothesis generation. You can often generate a whole bunch of
hypotheses that might give you hints into what kind of quantitative data analysis
you do by performing qualitative research upfront, or
even during your quantitative analysis. Qualitative research methodologies,
as I mentioned before, involve things like interviews and
focus groups. Many qualitative researchers also use
observations of various kinds where they go to a context and
actually observe what's happening. There's many, many other methodologies. And then data analysis
itself is a rich area in which you can do
what are called coding. In which you take text or video or
other kinds of information, and have human coders go through and try to explain what
different themes that a content covers, or what different polarities
people might be expressing, whether they're angry or sad or upset. People do content analysis
on actual text documents. There's also something called thematic
analysis, in which you try to extract the themes and the highlights
of particular qualitative data. And all of this are things that people
who use qualitative research methodology tend to use. In this particular course, I'm going to
kind of focus on the barebones qualitative research methodologies that
you need to really take advantage of the methodology for
the sake of quantitative data analysis. So we'll focus on interviews,
primarily semi-structured interviews that you conduct with real people,
of course, and do thematic analysis on that content through something
that's called affinity walls. And part of affinity walls, you'll see, is
a process by which you cluster information and then hierarchically organize it,
so that you can come up to higher and higher level insights about what
people believe about the data, or what they expect to see in the data. The nice thing about qualitative
research is that it complements what you would otherwise do through
quantitative data research. So for example, qualitative research is
excellent, again, at generating hypotheses that you can confirm or
reject through quantitative research. Qualitative research can supply
rich details that you won't get in any data set. Oftentimes, qualitative research
is a good way to combine and synthesize different types of information. Even as a quantitative data scientist, you will often have situations in which
you're given documents, you're given the chance to talk to other people
who know something about the domain. And you need to combine
that information with the hard numbers that result
from your data analysis. And then finally, qualitative research methodology is very
good at developing narratives, so that you can tell a strong story about the analysis
that you ultimately do, whether it is quantitative entirely, or involves both
qualitative and quantitative elements. So in the next set of videos, I'll talk a lot more about semi-structured
interviews and how to conduct those.
