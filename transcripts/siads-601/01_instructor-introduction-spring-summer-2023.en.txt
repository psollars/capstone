Hi, everyone, welcome to qualitative
inquiry for data scientists. My name is Anthony Josiahs, and
I will be your instructor for the spring summer term. I'm a lecturer at the School of
Information at the University of Michigan. I've taught courses in the online and residential master's programs
in the last three years. Some additional background about me
is that I graduated from the PhD program at the School
of Information in 2013. Prior to starting my PhD,
I had about 15 years of professional experience in
the world of archives and museums. Therefore, my research and dissertation, which was primarily qualitative,
was about social memory and archives. I've been both a lead and secondary
instructor for Qualitative Inquiry for Data Scientists before, so I have in
depth knowledge of the content and how the course works. Some of you may already know that my
colleague, Professor Quintaro Tayama, designed this course and
that he has taught this course many times. You'll see Professor Tayama's name
frequently in course documentation and that all of the course videos
have been recorded by him. My role as an introductional lead for this iteration of 601 is
as a course facilitator. I'll be your first point of contact
to answer questions about the course content and assignments. I would also encourage everyone to move
as swiftly as you can in defining your main project for this course. The details of the project
are available on Coursera. You also have an opportunity to meet the
instructional team who will be providing feedback on your projects over
the four week duration of the class. We hope to see many people
at office hours and look forward to working with
you over the next four weeks.
