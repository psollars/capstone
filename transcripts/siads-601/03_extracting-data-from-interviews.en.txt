In the previous segment
we talked about tips for how you actually conduct the interview. In this segment, we're going to talk about
what you want to do after the interview. Now you remember that you either
have an audio recording or you'd have taken good notes with
respect to any given interview. Ideally, you'll have both. And these notes and
the audio recording themselves will basically be the raw
material out of which you're going to extract the qualitative data
that is going to be used for analysis. Now, as soon as possible
after the interview, and ideally no more than about 48
hours after the interview itself. You're going to want to review the notes
and go through the audio recording, and write down what we call affinity notes. An affinity note is basically
a sticky note in which you write a participant code,
like participant P1, P2, P3. And a statement that comes from
your notes or audio recordings, which is probably relevant
to the overarching question. Now what do I mean by sticky note? Well, those are those notes that people
use to write notes and put on let's say, the refrigerator door. And what you're going to do when we get to
the affinity wall analysis section of this course, is actually use these notes and
rearrange them in various clusters. But before you get there, we need to actually create that
affinity notes themselves. What makes a good affinity
note is really the main part of the substance of this segment. What you want to include in these affinity
notes are various kinds of statements. They could be factual statements that
came out of the interview themselves, and it's important that they're complete
sentences that stand on their own. They could be participant quotations,
which you will definitely want to write in quotation marks so that you remember that
they came straight from the participant. Again, they could be quotations that
are about a particular statement that the person made, tt might even be a question in some cases, it might be something
that they just suggested. They don't necessarily need to be facts
as long as something that they said seems relevant to your overarching question. You might want to capture observations
that you made while you were interviewing the person such as that the person seemed a little
bit nervous when they were talking about something or that they seemed angry
when they're talking about something. And then, on top of that, you can also
include your own interpretations of some of the things that people have said. So if you heard, let's say three
different interview participants, all say the same thing, you might want to add in
a fitting note that says, everybody seems to agree that
a certain fact was true. And then finally, you can include certain related
questions that you might want to ask. These will be relatively rare,
but they might help organize some of the notes later on when we
get to the affinity wall section. Some tips to be mindful of when
you're writing these affinity notes. You want to be very concrete but
also very concise. So especially, unless they're quotations, direct quotations from the actual
interview participants, then you want to use statements that
capture the essence of what you're trying to say, but without being too long. On the flip side, it's really important
that every affinity note stands on its own, in the sense that you can understand
what was meant by it later on. It's very easy to forget,
just within a couple of days, all of the details of what
happened within an interview. And so you want to make sure that every
affinity note it's clear what the context was and what exactly
was being talked about. In cases where you have participant
quotations, you might need to preface it with a little description of what
they were saying it in response to or what it was about that you're
writing the quotation down for. And then one general guideline,
this is not again a hard rule but you want to aim for about one affinity
note per minute or two of interview. So if you have a 60 minute interview, you'll likely to end up with anywhere
from 30 to 60-ish affinity notes. And again, these will be
the qualitative data from which you conduct your qualitative analysis,
using affinity walls. This week you're going to
start your interviews, so hopefully you were able to schedule
some of the interviews for this week. Each of these interviews should take
about one hour, plan for about an hour. They might be a little bit shorter if it
turns out that the interview participant doesn't have that much to say. In some cases they may go over,
if they really have a lot to say. And of course, take notes, get permission
for an audio recording if you can, and then aim for somewhere about 100 to 200
notes total for all three interviews. Again, if you have about an affinity note
per every one or two minutes of interview, then you'll end up with about 100 and
200 notes naturally. Otherwise, please see the assignment for
specific details, both for the interviews as well as for
this data extraction exercise.
