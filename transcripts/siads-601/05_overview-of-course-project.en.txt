In this segment, we'll talk about the course project
that you're going to be using throughout this course because in this course you'll
be conducting interviews, performing qualitative
data analysis, and writing a report, we need something that you're going to be doing
these things about. So for that, you'll
need to choose a single project that runs
through the entire course. Basically what I want you to do is think about a
scenario in which you're a data
scientist who's been tasked with analyzing
some data set. Assume that you know
relatively little about the content and domain of the data set but
you have access to people who care about the
information in the data set. Maybe they're the people who commissioned the data
set or the people who care very much about the outcome of your data
analysis but in any case, by interviewing
them you can learn something about the
expectations of the data in the data set as well as what people are expecting
to hear from you. When you analyze
what they tell you, it will provide a
starting point and possibly a rough
framework for how you direct your quantitative
data analysis. So again, for the course project, and this is very important
that you do this really well because it will
affect the entire course, you'll need to identify
a data set and a set of three stakeholders that you could interview that
fit the scenario above. So what particularly
makes a good project? First of all, I want to emphasize that you
want to look for an existing
quantitative data set. The data set should
be reasonably rich, probably unexplored, especially by you and you
want to have good contacts with the data-set stakeholders so that you could potentially
interview them, I'll get back to
this in a moment. It's not necessary that you have actual access to the data set
but I do want to emphasize that it should be a real
existing data set and the reason for this is the people
that you interview, will treat you and
the interview and the whole situation differently if it's something that
they're merely imagining. So it's important that
there's an actual data set associated with your
project for this course. Another thing is that I
would like you to choose a data set that you're not
that familiar with, and again, this is because you want to go in fresh in these interviews in a situation in which
you probably know very little about the
data or the domain. We'd like you to interview at least three people who are connected to the data
set in this course. You could interview more
people if you're really interested in practicing
your interviewing skills, but it's important
that those three people are chosen so that they care about the data
that's in the data set. They might have
different perspectives about the data or the data set, or how they relate to the data and the information
that's contained in it and they should all be willing to do 30-60 minute interviews around the 2nd and 3rd week
of this four-week course. In the actual written assignment, you'll find that there's much more specific details about roughly what days you should
aim for these interviews, please look at those, and then finally the scope of the data set
should be just right. The data set shouldn't be
too large or too complex, it shouldn't be too
smaller or simple. Think of it as the
kind of data set where you could gain some
insight about what you might be expected to do quantitative data
analysis through three interviews or so. I'm going to go
through some examples of good data sets and
then towards the end, I'll give a couple of examples of data sets that would probably not be good for this course. So here's a good example of a potential course project
you might propose. Imagine that you know that there's a data
set collected by your local police department
about traffic stops and citations between
some 10-year period. It's likely to be something like a single Excel spreadsheet with thousands of rows
and dozens of columns. Big enough that you wouldn't immediately be able to
tell patterns within it, big enough that there's lots of interesting trends and patterns you might be able to find, and also sufficiently
complex that is not immediately obvious what
kinds of analysis to do. Potential stakeholders
you might want to interview might be, for example, this department's
deputy chief who obviously would have a very
good perspective about how the police department views this data and what kinds of
trends they would expect to see. Another possible
interviewee would be a police officer from the
department who obviously has daily interaction with
people that they would stop in traffic and
issue citations for, and they might be able
to give you hints into certain trends that you
would see in the data. Another possibility is the
administrative staff member who's responsible for
putting the data together. They would have an idea about
how the data was collected, what kinds of gaps there might
be in the data? What kinds of problems there
might be in the data? In any case, all three of these people will be people
that if you interviewed, would be able to give
you some pointers into how to begin a
quantitative data analysis. Here's another example. This could be data
collected over five years, let's say by an
e-commerce company that specializes
in selling shoes. You might have several
database tables with, again, thousands of rows and dozens of columns and here are some stakeholders that you
might interview, again, assuming that you
have access to them, the company's head of sales would obviously be
very interested in understanding what kind of
pattern the data contains with respect
to what shoes are selling and
who's buying them. A member of the marketing staff might be interested in seeing whether the data reflects
their marketing efforts, and of course even a frequent user of the e-commerce website might be able to tell you
the different ways in which they have interacted with the e-commerce website and how their buying decisions might
influence their behavior. So these are all possible stakeholders you could
interview to getting some insight about a data set about e-commerce shoe company. Here's a third example, imagine that your state's Department of Parks
and Recreation has some kind of data about how
its resources are used by residents over the past year. This might be a
mish-mash of spreadsheet and databases with
this information for each county in the state and here are some stakeholders that you might want to interview. It could be the department's
research director who would obviously be very interested in any kind of analysis of this data. It could be a park
ranger who knows a lot about the people that use these parks and other
resources or it could be somebody who is a regular user of the
state's parks and who again, might be able to point
you towards trends that you might expect to find
in such a data set. Again, the important
thing is that there is an existing data set overall, that you're going to work with
and which you're going to propose for your
course project and that you can name
three people that you already have ties with who will already have agreed to conducting an interview with you sometime in the next
couple of weeks. A couple of bad examples. These aren't necessarily
terrible in the sense of you could get by
by doing a project but it'll be much harder to
find interesting things to conduct an interview
about and then to do a meaningful qualitative
data analysis at the end. You don't want to address
a data set that's too big. For example, all of
the data collected by your country's national census
bureau for the 50 years, that just seems too big to
really get a handle on. You could interview a few
people but they would tell you very different things
about the trends that they would expect and
it wouldn't coalesce as a coherent framework
for you to do future quantitative
data analysis on. On the other side, you don't want to go too small, sales data from your
child's candy sale at school last month
might be too small. Maybe there's a spreadsheet
with a couple of columns. It's not likely that
you're going to get meaningful responses to any questioning with stakeholders who would be involved in a
very small project like that. So try to find a data set that is of reasonable size
something that you might actually do a single quantitative
data analysis project on but which you don't have
too much background in, and where you have connections to different people who would be open to doing
interviews with you. For more details, please look at the written assignment that is on the platform and it
will contain a lot of details about exactly when you should plan for these
interviews and again, I would recommend that
you try to schedule the interviews in
order to fulfill the assignment so that
there's no question about whether you'd be able to do three interviews
during the course.
