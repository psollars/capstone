Affinity walls are one way of doing qualitative data analysis. I personally like using
affinity walls because, they make the actual clustering and sorting of
ideas very visible, and also they're fun just
because you're using lots of Post-it Notes and
moving them around. You've probably seen
or at least heard of people using Post-it Notes
to think through ideas, and now we'll get to see
exactly how that works. So an affinity wall is basically, you take all of your
affinity notes in this photograph it's
the yellow notes, and then you cluster them. Then after you cluster them for each cluster, you're
going to create a summary. So the idea is that
you cluster first, write summaries, and then depending on how
much notes you have, you'll end up with
lots of summaries, which themselves
could then be further clustered and you can
repeat this hierarchically. Ultimately, you're
going to stop when the summaries themselves
either become too broad to be informative or when you have a relatively small
number of summaries. For affinity notes, when
you're constructing them, the first thing is to lay out
all of your affinity notes. You're going to make the
clusters very quickly. Just try to find affinity notes that seem to have something to do with each other. At this stage, you want to create clusters
relatively quickly. Don't think about it too much, and also don't get too
attached to any one cluster. You're going to move
your notes around. Whenever you see a new clusters
form, you might say, "Oh, this note actually belongs
in a different location". You can keep merging clusters together or
breaking them apart. Generally you want to aim
for clusters that are about 3-7 affinity notes. These are not strict rules, so you can definitely
go beyond it or have even clusters with
two or fewer notes. But generally try to think, if I have seven or more notes or certainly getting into 10, 20 notes, you want to break
them up so that you can find more granular clusters that can be summarized at an
even more precise level. Or if you have a,
very small clusters that seem to be about
the same thing, you want to merge them. After you form these clusters, you're going go to
the next phase, which is the most important. So as you can see
in this photograph, on top of sets of
clusters of yellow notes, you're going to see
these light blue notes. In these light blue
notes, what you see are this particular group handwriting the summaries of what the yellow notes
underneath them represent. Now the colors don't
matter that much. But the important part
is that when you're writing these summary notes, this is where a lot of the interesting
analysis is happening. So you want to make
sure that you're taking enough time
to do them well. The goal is to summarize the information of all of
the notes in the cluster, you want to write
a summary that is a full sentence and that
makes sense on its own, so that if you read
only the summary, you can still get
a sense for what the notes are about
underneath it. Then you want to
balance abstraction and precision. So
what does that mean? On the one hand, you want
to write a summary that is an abstracted version of the summary of all of
the notes underneath it. On the other hand, you
want it to be specific enough that it captures something interesting about
the series of notes. So for example, if you have a series of notes
about, let's say, potential police bias
in police data records, you might write, "There
seems to be a bias". That's a very abstracted thing that's certainly likely
to summarize everything. On the other hand, it
doesn't tell you that much. So you want to be
even more precise. For example, you might say that, "According to the
notes underneath here, there's bias that is
specific to gender. Maybe male traffic, male drivers are being treated
worse than female drivers," and if that's true, you want to mention that fact
very specifically. In any case, you
want to summarize the affinity notes that
are within the cluster, and then as I mentioned, you want to repeat
this hierarchically. So for every cluster you'll have a summary and then once you
have a lot of summaries, each of those summaries
could be again, clustered and then summarized. You're going to stop creating
these new levels when the summaries themselves seem
to become uninformative, usually because so much gets
pushed under one cluster that the only statements
you can make are super broad and largely not
saying anything again. A good affinity wall,
if you do this, will naturally lead to a good
report because now you have an organization of
the different ideas that are in all of your data, and they're clustered,
they're 'summarized, and then those summaries themselves are further
clustered and so on. We'll talk more about how you
put together these kinds of affinity note summaries into a final report in
a future segment. Now in the assignment
for the affinity wall, what I would like you
to do is to complete the affinity wall using
your own affinity notes. Now I strongly encourage that you actually try this with
actual Post-it Notes. It's helpful if you have
several different colors. You want most of your affinity
notes, of which you'll have the most, in the color that
you have the most of. Then at different
levels of the summary, it's useful if you have
different colored Post-it Notes, but it's not strictly necessary. The important thing is that the hierarchy is very
clear for you to see and that you can very
easily move these notes around. There are also
online tools for you to create either affinity walls explicitly or to just organize virtual Post-it
Notes on the screen, and you can certainly use those. At some point, it
might be helpful, but I find that this exercise
is actually more fun, and also you get a sense for the clustering much
more quickly if you do it physically on
physical Post-it Notes. Ultimately, for this assignment, you're going to submit
a photograph or a file. The resolution of the photograph should be high enough that you can actually read
individual affinity notes, if at least you zoom
into the photograph. For further details,
please see the assignment. Ultimately, again, I think that affinity walls are a lot of fun, so try to enjoy the process. It can be really interesting
to see physically how your thinking process
evolves and how the analysis of data
happens. So have fun.
