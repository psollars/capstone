Hi, and welcome to Qualitative Inquiry
for Data Scientists. This is the introduction to
the course that is all about qualitative research
methodology that is useful for data scientists. As a data scientist, you
might be asked to do something like analyze
a set of data. Let's say in this case
about a bunch of data that you have gotten from
the local police department. Maybe they have a
huge amount of data over the last decade
about, let's say, traffic citations, traffic stops, and what ultimately happened
in each of those stops. Now, if you were just given the data as sometimes data
scientists are given, you might not know
what questions to ask, what kind of data analysis
to perform. Also in some cases you might want hints about what to
actually look for. What are the causal
mechanisms for some of the phenomena
that you might find? Then ultimately, you need
to find a way to tell the right story about the
data analysis that you do. That can also be a process
where you need to understand the larger context of the dataset and of
the domain itself. In this course, what you're
going to learn is something that is very different
from a lot of the other MADS courses. It will be content that has to do with a qualitative
research methodology. Now you might ask,
of what value is qualitative research
to data scientists? After all, data
scientists work primarily with quantitative
research methodologies. But in my research, I often find that qualitative and
quantitative methodologies can compliment each other and even if you don't do an explicitly mixed-method
type of project, it's still helpful to
do a little bit of qualitative research
as a way to help frame and ultimately to possibly
tell a good story about your quantitative
data analysis. Qualitative data analysis is, and qualitative research
methodology overall, is generally very
good at generating hypotheses and
insights into data. Sometimes it can give
you insight into causal mechanisms for
things that are not immediately obvious in
numerical data itself. It often will complement data science with
rich descriptions of phenomena that you won't have
in the numerical dataset. You can also compile,
organize, and synthesize information, not just from your quantitative data, but from all kinds of other
sources of information. One of the strengths of
qualitative research methodologies is
that it gives you tools to synthesize very heterogeneous
sources of information. Ultimately, good data
scientists are able to provide strong narratives about their quantitative analysis and a lot of that process of constructing a good
narrative is actually better studied through
qualitative methodology than in the quantitative
data sciences. So what does this mean overall? What are the different kinds of
situations in which qualitative research
might actually apply to a data science project? You might want to use it before quantitative
analysis and in fact, before you even have any
kind of data at all, it's important to have some sense of the context and the domain, to understand what kind of
data to collect, to understand what kind of
hypotheses to test. During your quantitative
data analysis you might also use qualitative
methodologies to generate further hypotheses or to provide conjectures
about gaps that are not represented in the data itself or which don't
come out in data analysis. Then of course, after you've done your quantitative
data analysis, qualitative methodologies
can be helpful for synthesizing findings, again, providing some ideas for
gaps in the data analysis, and constructing a
broader narrative that will allow you to make your own data analysis as compelling as possible
to your audience. The focus in this particular
course will be on three things, on
semi-structured interviews. This is a very widely used method for qualitative data collection. Affinity walls, which are a specific way to do
qualitative data analysis. I'll tell you later
on why I believe that qualitative data analysis of this kind is actually
a certain way to create, to do analysis in an intelligent way when you don't have a structure
to that data. Storytelling is
also an element of qualitative
methodologies and a lot of the narrative
construction that can help you tell
your story about any data analysis is also something that you'll learn through qualitative methodology. Again, the strengths of qualitative research
are that it can often cover a broad
range of information, it can help you decide what to hone in on and what to focus on. It often results in very rich information of a kind that is missing from quantitative
datasets, and of course, you can do qualitative
research in the absence of quantitative data and so it's
often a very good way to kick off a research project before you actually have
any numerical data in hand. I also want to let you know what things the course
does not cover. Qualitative research
methodology actually covers a wide range
of methodologies. People do everything
from, of course, interviews and focus
groups, to case studies. Many people do what's called
ethnographic observation, where you actually go to a specific context and watch what's happening
very closely, observing all of the phenomena. Some people actually participate in an activity to
learn more about it and then there's all kinds of analysis that happens
with records, documents, and actual
text, written text. Then some people do
qualitative coding of data in which you
take texts material, and then code it in various
ways so that you can understand what the
actual text is about. There's a lot of theory
based analysis as well. Largely we will not be covering these topics
in this course, even though they
are methodologies for qualitative research. I should mention there's also other
kinds of research in which you take all kinds of
different data, whether it's video
data, audio data, sound data, and even that can be thrown into
qualitative methodology. You'll learn a little
bit about how to potentially incorporate
data from those sources, but in this course, we will focus primarily on interviews.
