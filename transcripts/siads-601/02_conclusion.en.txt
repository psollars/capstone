In this final video segment for
the course, we'll cover the things that we went over
and talk a little bit about the different names under which some of the
methodologies that we covered are called. We of course,
covered semi-structured interviews, affinity walls for
doing qualitative data analysis, and we talked a little bit
about storytelling as, a way to aid report writing. Now some of the strengths of qualitative
research that you've learned cover a broad range of information and
data, you can often use, incorporate rich information
that isn't just numeric. And of course, you don't need quantitative data to be
able to do a qualitative data analysis. I want to remind you also of the value
that qualitative research might have to data scientists. Now you might never actually do the
interviewing or the affinity walls that we learned in this class, but hopefully
you'll have gained some appreciation for what qualitative research can
get you as a data scientist. It might be that somebody else does
the qualitative research part and hands over their findings to you. You can use qualitative data research to
generate hypotheses, offer insights into causal mechanisms and otherwise to kind
of to compile and synthesize information. One thing that some people say is that if
you become a good qualitative researcher on top of already having
the quantitative background, then what you can do is use mixed methods as
a way to triangulate information and data. So that you have a more comprehensive
picture of any particular situation that you're analyzing. The methodologies taught in this
course were basically based on qualitative research methodologies that
are sometimes called other things. For example, you might hear contextual
inquiry, user-centered inquiry, human-centered inquiry, or
simply ethnographic research. The affinity walls that we used in this
course were a methodology that was invented by a Japanese
ethnologist named Jiro Kawakita. And sometimes you'll hear them
called affinity diagrams. In some entrepreneurial circles,
they're called the KJ method. KJ being the initials of Kawakita, the way that they would occur in Japanese
where you have the last name first. But what's interesting about
this is that when he was thinking through this methodology, he
thought that he was coming up with a way that was different from deductive
reasoning or inductive reasoning. But ultimately,
I think it's just good reasoning. One thing I will say is that all of the
methodologies you learned in this course are actually applicable for
a broad range of scenarios. You can use them on their own to do
actually qualitative research without data without quantitative data. Or you can use them as a way to learn
new things that you don't understand especially if you have access
to that context. And then as far as qualitative data
analysis goes, affinity walls are a great way to bring together information
in all kinds of contexts. I've heard from some of my
students who use them for just planning out, strategizing
about their future careers, or thinking through something that, a problem
that they've been mulling, whether or not it's specifically a project
that is for their work. And finally, I want to say that,
just like with all data analysis methods, that qualitative research is really
a skill and so the more you practice it, the better you become. So hopefully you'll have a chance
to practice your interviews and qualitative data analysis going forward. Ultimately, I'd like to thank you for
joining us for this course. Hopefully, it was fun. And if nothing else, I hope you learned
the value of what qualitative data researchers do, in addition to the work
that you're doing in data analytics. Thank you.
