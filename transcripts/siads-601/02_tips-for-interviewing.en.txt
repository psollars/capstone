In this segment, we're now going to start talking
about the actual interviewing itself. So as I mentioned with
interview protocols, they're kind of the preparation,
both mentally and in fact in the form of the questions,
for your actual interview. But during the interview, especially
as you're going to try to maintain this conversational style,
you're going to have to improvise, you're going to have to think on your
feet and let go of the interview protocol itself as a guide to how you're
actually going to proceed. Let me tell you about an interview
that I conducted many years ago. It was one of the most challenging
interviews I've ever had. This was a time when I lived and work in
India, and I was doing work in the rural areas of the country to try to understand
different challenges they faced and how we could potentially find solutions for
them that would use digital technology. In any case, in this one instance,
I was speaking with a woman, I of course, didn't speak any of the local languages,
and so I had an interpreter with me from
a local nonprofit organization. I asked the interpreter to translate
everything that she said, or I said. And the idea was that I would ask these
questions, and I would listen for the responses. Now, this particular woman, probably due
to the fact that this complete stranger had arrived in her village and
was asking all kinds of questions, she obviously looked very intimidated and
she really didn't respond to many of my questions with anything other
than a nod or a simple yes or no. And ultimately I felt like I
had to break the ice somehow. And one of the nice things was in
that case she was at her home and I noticed that she had several
children running around her. And so I started asking questions about
her kids and about how old they were, and how, whether they went to school and
what they liked to do and so on. And almost immediately her
facial expression changed. She just became much more cheerful
talking about her children. And I felt that if I continue that
conversation just a little bit, that eventually she would feel
a little bit more comfortable with me. And that's exactly what happened. I wouldn't say that her answers were as in
depth as some of the other people I spoke with that day, but
it was definitely an easier interview once I chit-chatted with her a little bit and
connected with her in a very human way. Oftentimes when we're
interviewing participants, we need to establish that kind of rapport. It's very unlikely that you're
going to end up doing interviews with somebody whose language
you don't even share. But there will still be times when, due to
personalities or the way that people feel or even the circumstances in
which they're being interviewed, that there'll be a little bit
reluctant to speak with you. So as a result, it's very useful
in any interview search situation to consider starting with
a little bit of small talk, find something in common
that you can discuss. Sometimes if you're at the workplace, they'll have photographs
that you can talk about. If you know a little bit about their work,
you can of course compliment them on their previous work, or, there's always
the fallback of discussing the weather. Whatever it is, you want to make sure that
you set the interview participant at ease. It's often helpful to let them know that
you're really here to learn from them, and to make sure that they understand that
this is not a situation where you're judging what they're doing or thinking. One of the most important skills in
any kind of interview is really to listen to what they're saying,
not just in terms of the words, but their whole body expression,
what is it that they're talking about? When do they seem to have concerns? When do they think that something that
they're saying might not quite be right, or when do they think that they're
saying something that they're very, very convinced of? I'm sure most of you have seen
one of the many Star Wars movies. This is a scene in the first
movie New Hope, Episode Four. Where Luke Skywalker is basically about
to drop a torpedo into the Death Star. One of the things he finds is that
his old Jedi Master, Obi Wan Kenobi is basically speaking to him from
the other side since Obi Wan has just appeared to have
died in a previous scene. And what he tells Lucas to
let go of the computer, and just trust your feelings,
trust your instincts. There's a similar thing that you
want to do during the interview. It's not quite trusting your instincts and
your feelings, but you do want to really keep your mind
on the overarching question, and let go of the interview protocol as,
again, a sequence of questions. Very often in a good interview what will
happen is that your interview participant will mention things that
are really interesting but which you might not have anticipated. And at those points, what you want to do
is follow up on the interesting point and try to go as far as you can,
that's in a way that's still relevant for your overarching question
without necessarily feeling that you have to stick to the questions
in the order that you have them written. Again, you want to use the interview
protocol as a backup reference, not as a strict set of questions that
you have to ask one after the other. One of the most important skills in any
interview situation is to listen for these unexpected but relevant comments. And as you practice more interviews,
you'll find that you get better and better at trying to understand where
people have something more they want to tell you even though they might
not be expressing it verbally. Ultimately, if you're really
curious about the situation and keep your mind on the overarching
question, you'll find that the interview goes quite well, even if you haven't asked
many of the questions in the protocol. Finally, one thing about note taking. During any interview,
you're going to want to take notes. Note taking is something that you
have to develop your own style for. If you have an audio recording, it often
means that you don't need to take very careful notes about everything that
the interview participants said. But you'll still want to capture
things like potential questions that you might want to ask later in the
interview or hand gestures that they made that might have indicated that something
that they said wasn't quite true, or anything that might have occurred
to you that isn't necessarily, wouldn't be in the audio recording, or that you might think is
really worth emphasizing. Of course, if you don't have permission to
take an audio recording of the interview, then you'll definitely want to
take very careful notes on, not just of these kinds of things, but
of the substance of what they're saying. Some people can take very good notes, especially if they have a laptop with
them, my recommendation is at least to try a couple of interviews with
note taking on pen and paper. And the reason for
this is that there's something about the screen that sets up a physical barrier
between you and the interview participant. And it can also create
a mental barrier for them, like they might not feel that you're
actually interested in what they have to say, because you seem more interested
in what's happening on the screen. Another thing is that,
when you're taking notes on a laptop, and especially if you're a good typist,
then you end up taking a lot of verbatim transcripts which again is repetitive
if you have an audio recording. And it also causes you to focus more
on the exact words that the participant is saying and not at the high level of
what they're actually relaying to you and what you should be thinking about
as the interview progresses. Ultimately again,
there's no one right way to take notes, you want to develop your own style. And the best way to learn that style is by
practicing and trying several interviews. As I mentioned, interviewing is a skill, it's not something that
you can learn right away. Some of us come with a certain amount
of talent and can do it very easily. Others of us have to practice
hard at getting good at it. There's a well-known joke among the
musicians which is, if you're walking down somewhere in New York and somebody asks
you, how do you get to Carnegie Hall? Well, the answer is,
practice, practice, practice. You want to maintain a conversational
tone throughout the interview and that's something that requires practice. You want to keep the overarching question
in mind, sometimes you end up getting so stuck on the protocol questions
that it's hard to remember why you're asking these questions
in the first place. The attitude of being curious and really
wanting to learn from the other person is one that for
some people require some practice. And ultimately these tips and
more are in the module handout for this particular segment. And I wish you good luck in
the interviews that you conduct. In a future segments we'll have a sample
interview that you can take a look at, and we'll also talk a little bit about how
to get the data that you want out of the audio recordings or the notes that
you've taken from your interviews.
