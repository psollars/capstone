Hi, my name is Kentaro Toyama, and I'll be
the instructor for Qualitative Inquiry for Data Scientists. My background is in computer science. I did a PhD in an area
called computer vision, which is a sub area of
artificial intelligence. For 12 years I worked at Microsoft
Research as a research scientist in areas that had to do with
artificial intelligence, computer vision, and
human-computer interaction. I was also a co-founder of
Microsoft's lab in India, where I did a lot of work where
we applied digital technology for socio-economic development of
the world's lower income communities. Today, I'm a professor at the
University of Michigan, School of Information. I teach SI 501, Contextual Inquiry. This is a course that's all about
qualitative user-centered design. And much of the methodology
that's taught in this course is material that's taken from
that residential course. I'm also the author of
a book called Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from
the Cult of Technology. And that's a book about how digital
technology can often amplify whatever underlying human forces
that are already there. I look forward to Qualitative Inquiry for
Data Scientists and I hope you enjoy the course.
