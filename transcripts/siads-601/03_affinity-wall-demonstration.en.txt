Welcome to the segment
on affinity walls. So in this segment, what I'm going to do
is do a demonstration of a very small affinity wall. It will give you a sense for
what exactly you need to do, even though the
scale is obviously going to be much smaller than
what you would actually do. So in this particular case, the scenario is that, let's
say, a company has asked you to do a data analysis
of all of their HR data, their human resources data, and you have already conducted interviews with one of the vice presidents
of the company, with an HR manager, and with an employee. Here are some affinity notes
that you have extracted from your interviews according to the instructions that you've already seen in other segments. What we're really going to
do at this point is start the clustering process
for the affinity notes, and then create summaries, and then ultimately see what the overall analysis for all
of this data is gonna be. I'll start by reading each
of these affinity notes, because they'll be
helpful for each of the notes to be
understood before we start. So in this case, P1 indicates the
Vice-President of the company. P1 believes that the company should expand its client
base internationally. Again, P1 has a quote, "I've been at the
company for 30 years, the last 25 as a VP." Again, P1, "We know that women middle managers are unhappy." Now I'm moving on to
some of the things that P2 said, the HR manager. P2 suggests that
there is a pattern of junior employees
leaving the company after five to ten years. P2, "I can't think of
any major problems we've had in the last year with
employees or managers." P2, "Our pay is generally good compared with
our competitors." Another one from P2, "In an
exit interview last week, a Manager who took a job
with a competitor told me that she didn't feel her
work was valued by her boss." Then moving on to an
employee interview, P3, "One client I had, they completely ignored
our recommendations." P3, "The work is great, but I don't see a
clear career ladder." Again, P3, "Last month I made a big mistake
with a client, I felt terrible, but my manager helped me
fix the situation." A couple more from P3,
"At my previous company, it took three hours to
file an expense report. It's not like that here." P3, "There are two execs
I often go to for advice. Though they're not
my immediate boss, they remind me of my uncles." Then I've also added a couple
of things that you might have gotten out of
other material, written material possibly that the company might have provided. One is that the company
was voted best place to work by a local
business magazine, and another, that last
year's employee poll showed a disparity
in morale by gender. Okay, so the question is, how do we organize all of this information so
that it provides a little bit more structure than just a bunch of random
quotes and facts? So the first thing you want
to do in an affinity wall, is to start clustering
things by theme. So for example, here's a affinity note that's
talking about clients, so maybe we can put together all the notes that
are about clients. Here is one, one client had, they completely ignored
our recommendations. Here's another one about clients. Just so that we can
still see all the notes, I'm going to reorganize them. So this looks like a cluster
that is just about clients. Now, if you look at
some of the rest, you might notice that there
are positive statements that are made about the company's work environment and
some that are negative. So maybe we can start by putting all the positive ones together and all of the negative
ones together. So let's say company was voted best place to work, that's
definitely positive. Pattern of junior employees
leaving the company, that doesn't sound so
good, so that's negative. Here's another one, in an
exit interview last week, a manager told me she didn't feel her work
was valued by her boss. At my previous company it
took three hours to file an expense report but
not here, that's good. I can't think of any major
problems, so that's good. I've been at the company
for 30 years the last 25 is a VP, that sounds good. We know that women middle
managers are unhappy, that doesn't sound so good. Last year's employee poll showed a disparity in morale by
gender, that's not good. There are two execs I
often go to for advice, so the execs seem approachable, that's usually a good thing. The work is great, but I
don't see a career ladder. That sounds mostly negative, although there's some positive. Our pay is generally good with our competitors, so
again, that's good. Now, if you look at this
you might say, okay, are there other ways
in which we can further split these up? Now, I would say, generally you want to stick to somewhere between threeish to seven or eight different
affinity notes, but in this case, I think we can further break down
some of these notes. So for example, on this side
for the negative comments, you'll notice that there's
something that has to do with maybe women. So women middle
managers aren't happy. Some disparity in
morale by gender. Then here's another one, in
an exit interview last week, a manager who took a job told me that she didn't feel
her work was valued. So these are at least
very clear cluster about women being
unhappy at the company. There's also something
about junior employees leaving the company is not
strictly about gender. Again here, a clear
career ladder. Now if you look back at these, most of these are on the whole, they're positive,
but they might also contribute to some
of these situations. So for example, P3, let's suppose we happen to
know this employee is male, it might be that there's
a good connection between the men at the company, but that the women are not feeling that kind of connection. So we might decide that we
want to put this together. I've been at the
company for 30 years, the last 25 as a VP, and this is generally I
would say it's a good thing, the people at the top level
of the company are happy, but it could also be that there is contributing to
a larger problem where people don't
feel like they have a way to get promoted. Let's take a look
at these. All of these sound generally positive, so let's put all
of these together. I'm going to reorganize
this a little bit. You can see when I'm doing
this clustering process, one of the important
things about this is that you want to make
sure that you're not too attached to any one
cluster and that you're willing to let go of whatever classifications you
made initially. Now let's go back to
look at the client ones. If you look at these,
you might say, okay these don't seem as relevant to this larger question of
the company culture. In fact, I would say
that this one about the company expanding
its client base is actually pretty irrelevant. I'm going to move it
over here because it might just be a
miscellaneous one-off. Similarly, the fact that one client ignored their
recommendations doesn't seem to be too relevant to this question
of the corporate culture. Last month I made a
mistake with a client, but my manager helped me fix it. This is a positive thing, it suggests that the company
is generally, has a very positive managing culture. These are all
positive statements. These are some
negative statements that seem to have something to do with the career ladder
or the absence thereof. Then these are all about
possibly there being some disparity in the way women, specifically women
managers, are treated. At this point we have
three different clusters and what you want to do
for each cluster next is to create summary notes that basically summarize the
content of the cluster. Now the important
thing when you do the summary is to think about, you want to make sure that the summary is broad
enough that it captures most of the
content of that cluster, but also precise so
that it's saying something a little bit interesting and not just
a very generic statement. Let's start over here. This one I think is going to
be pretty generic, despite what I just said,
because they're all about how the company is overall a
pretty good place to work. Let's take a look at that. I'm going to add a note up here. This is a summary which I've
pre-written in anticipation, so overall work environment
seems to be good. Now let's take a
look at this one. I've been at the
company for 30 years, the last 25 as a VP, there's a pattern of junior employees leaving the company. The work is great but I don't
see a clear career ladder. This suggests that
there's a little bit of a problem with how the company thinks about its career
trajectories for its employees. Maybe some people are leaving because they don't see opportunities
for advancement. A summary statement might
be junior employees leave because of limited
opportunities for advancement. Now, I put a question mark
here because these are really just the statements coming from three
different people. We don't know how widespread this phenomenon is and that
would be something that, for example, further
a quantitative data analysis should reveal. But as a tentative hypothesis, this seems reasonably good. Now let's go on to this one. Here, men seem to have a reasonably good relationship with the leadership
of the company, women middle managers
are unhappy, there's some evidence
that there might be a disparity and morale by gender, then a woman manager felt like her work was
not valued by her boss. This suggests in this case that maybe women employees
and managers might be relatively undervalued by their managers and
by the executives. At this point I would
say we are done with this set for the clustering and for the summarization, and I want to make a few
comments at this point about how you might use
this going forward. First of all, what
you have now are three potential
hypotheses that you might want to verify through further quantitative
data analysis. So right there, all of this work that you've done
so far through interviews, through doing the analysis gives you something that you
can actually latch onto with respect to what
you might want to look into when you do a data
analysis going forward. Another thing is that,
should the data analysis actually substantiate
each of these points, then you actually have something that looks like
an interesting narrative. If you look at
these three things, it says maybe that the overall
work environment is good, but there's a couple of problems. One is that there're not very clear opportunities
for advancement and another that maybe women employees
and managers are not being treated the same way that the men at the company are. Again, we don't
know whether or not this is true or
not at this point, but there are pretty
strong hypotheses and if you look at the
overall narrative, what you get is that
overall work environment is good but there are a couple of problems along these lines. The affinity wall in this case both helps you get a sense for all of the different facts that you collected in interviews. Then clustering them into individual hypotheses that you might want to verify through
quantitative data analysis. Then even the beginnings of a narrative that tells
you how you want to organize the overall story if each of these
points is born out. I will say that in this
case, we were a little bit lucky in that this
one came out first. When you're constructing
the narrative you want to think about what's the right
order to present things. For example, do you want
to lead with the fact that junior employees have limited opportunities
for advancement, but everything else seems good. Or you want to start
with everything seems pretty good but there's a
couple of residual problems. That's really up to your sense
for the audience and what you think they might
want to see most. That's really the end of the
affinity wall demonstration. At this point hopefully
you've gotten a sense. The wall that you
work on will have many more affinity notes and so you'll have to go through
this clustering process at a much larger scale. Also, once you get through
this level, you might find that
you can even further cluster the summary notes as well and so that will give you a hierarchically
clustered situation. But the essence of what you're going to do is very similar to what I just
demonstrated. Thank you.
