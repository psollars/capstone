In this segment,
we'll talk about what goes into an interview protocol at a relatively high level. Interview protocol
is basically a set of instructions for
the interviewer for a particular set of
interviews that includes scripted elements and guidelines again, for the interviewer. The components of any
given interview protocol will generally include
the following elements. An overarching question, an introduction in
which you describe what the interview protocol
is about and gain the interviewees
informed consent, a bunch of questions, and then finally, a conclusion. The overarching question is an element of interview protocols that a lot of people who actually work with the interviews don't always talk about, but which I find to be really important for the actual
process of doing the interview, as well as for managing
the interview protocol. You can think of the
overarching question as the main question
that you're going to try to answer throughout
the interview. It's something that is
really helpful to keep in mind throughout the
interview when you're actually conducting
the interview and talking to the people
that you're interviewing and you won't necessarily ask the overarching question to interview
participants directly, although in some cases you might actually do that
at the end as well. The introduction to
the interview protocol is the section in which you have a script that gives us some background about what
the interview is about. It basically prepares the
interview participant for the remainder of
the interview itself. You'll give a little
introduction about yourself, some of the goals of the
interview at a high level, and give a sense for roughly how long you expect the
interviewer to take place. Informed consent is often part of the introduction as well. It's a section in
which you're going to explain some of the more ethical issues
around interviews. Generally, we will
tend to protect the confidentiality of our
interview participants and we want to make sure that
they know that and we also want them to know that the whole interview process is voluntary and that they
can stop at anytime, ask us to delete all of the data that we've collected through them as part
of that interview, or possibly to completely cancel the interview altogether. Request for permissions are
something that you want do towards the end
of the introduction, both to conduct the interview and also to audio record
the interview itself. In the interviews that we will be conducting for this course, I'll be asking you
to actually try to get audio recordings of
the interviews themselves, but some participants may
refuse, and that's okay. You're just going to ask for the permission and if
they don't give it, you might have to
take better notes, but it doesn't change the
fact of the interview itself. Then comes the main body
of the interview protocol. These are the
interview questions. You can think of them as
a rough storyboard for the kinds of questions that
you're going to ask in the range of the topics
they're going to cover, as well as the order that
you're going to try to guide the interview through. They often will
start with a set of background or warm up questions. Interviews often have
something like momentum, where once an interview
participant gets going, they're really quite happy to answer questions in the
way that you ask them. Sometimes at the
beginning you need a little bit of warm up just to get them used to
answering questions, getting them comfortable
with you and so on. These background questions will tend to be a little bit shorter, they'll tend to be
simple and close ended. In contrast the main questions
that you're going to ask, the core questions for the interview are going to be open-ended and conversational. In fact, throughout the
whole interview process for a semi-structured interview, you want to maintain a
conversational tone and try to put the interview
participant at ease. The core questions will
involve both key questions, which are some of the bigger questions that
you want to have answered, as well as follow-up
questions that you may or may not ask depending on whether the participant
actually answers the original key questions
and how deeply they do so. We'll talk a little
bit more about the core questions
in the next segment. Then finally, in an
interview protocol, you'll have a conclusion. You can ask participants if
they have anything to add. It's always a good idea
to thank them not just once or twice, a few times, since they really provided
a lot of the data that you need for your analysis. You want to tell them
about followup plans, if they have any
additional questions or if they have anything that they might want to report to you that they should
get in touch with you. Also, of course, you may have additional questions that
you want to ask them. You want to let them know
that that might happen. Again, it's good to end
with general requests for any questions they might have and then finally to
thank them again. Some other things
to remember about the interview protocol
and the interview itself. Again, the interview protocol is just a set of guidelines. There aren't hard rules during the interview itself
about what you can ask. It is expected that
you'll go off script multiple times during
the interview itself. So you don't want to think of the interview
protocol as a set of questions that you ask one after the other in a
machine gun fashion. The most important thing
in any given interview is to be aware of the
ethics of the situation. Sometimes you may be
putting people in uncomfortable situations or ask them questions that they
really don't want to answer. You want to be sensitive
to that and make sure that you don't push beyond
ethical boundaries. Of course, the most
important thing as far as your interests
are concerned is answering your own overarching
question and getting the information that you need from the interview participant. In the next segment, we'll cover specific
interview protocol tips.
