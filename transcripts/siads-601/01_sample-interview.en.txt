Hi. For this segment, we're going to be conducting
a sample interview. This is a scenario in which
I have, in this case, Jasmit Kaur, who in real life is the CEO and co-founder
of Culturebie, a talent analytics
firm but in this case, she's going to be taking
on a role which is as the head of HR for a company called the Acme Widget Company. I'll be conducting the interview. A couple of things I want to tell you about before we start. First is, as you'll see, I have my interview protocol here
and you might be a little bit difficult to see but I've printed it out in such a
way that there's lots of room for notes because I'll be taking notes
during the interview. Another thing you'll notice is that when I do the
introduction with her, I won't actually ask her
about audio recording until I've started asking
a couple of questions. That's often a good way to build up momentum
in an interview and often it results in a little bit less
resistance to being recorded by the interviewee. All right, we'll begin. Hi, my name is Kentaro Toyama. I'm conducting
an interview that is ultimately to understand
what kinds of trends and patterns there might be about employees
at your company, the Acme Widget Company. I'm really here to learn as much as
I can about your company, I understand that you're the
head of HR for Acme Widget. I don't know anything about
the company at this point so you can just treat me as
somebody who doesn't know, you're really the expert. I'm going to ask you a bunch
of things and ultimately, some of this might end up in an internal report for your company but
I'll make sure that none of the comments
that you make to me will end up associated with your name. I'm also interviewing
several other people so all of the comments will
ultimately be aggregated, and I don't expect in
this case that any of the comments that you make
will be ever made public, so it shouldn't be something
that you're concerned about. But if there's anything that
you want me to take off the record or something
that you want to unsay, you can let me know and
I'd be happy to delete those comments and those notes. The other thing I want
you to know is that this interview is
completely voluntary, so if at any point there's
anything that causes you to want to stop or want to cancel the interview
altogether, please let me know. Okay.
Alright, do you have any questions for me? No, nothing for now. Okay. Then let's get started. How long have you been in your role at Acme Widget Company? So I started at Acme six years ago in an HR business partner role and I then stepped into recruiting for a little bit and currently I'm the head of HR. Great, terrific. Now, I have a dataset from your company
that actually one of your colleagues provided with me, which is a couple of years of employee polling data and all
the data that your company has about hiring,
termination, and promotions. Do you know about this dataset, and if so, what's your
relationship to it? I absolutely know
about the dataset, our HR operations team is the one that manages the HRIS
system from which all the data around tenure and demographic aspects of the employees collected
and maintained, and then the employee
pulse, employee feedback survey which we collect
at least twice a year, we conduct these surveys, we get lean list data. I am very closely
associated with that. Okay, terrific. By the way, do you mind if I take an audio recording of
this conversation? Absolutely. All right. Let me
get that started. Since you oversee the HR
function at Acme Widget, can you think of
anything that you've recently heard in the way
of employee complaints? We have, especially among some of our women employees.
We've had, a specific, an example that comes to my
mind is of a manager who surfaced this issue
that his direct report, who's a very
experienced, long-term, good performing employee, is very dissatisfied with her
growth at the company. Yeah, tell me a little
bit more about it. It sounds like you heard
from the manager and not directly from the employee? No, not in that case because I do very regular one-on-ones with our management team and
this particular manager is a very senior manager
in the organization and I like to keep
a pulse of what's happening and I just heard this particular
instance and I've heard some similar issues even from the other HR partners
who're reporting to me. That's something I'm sensing in the organization and I'm
very concerned about it. Can you tell me a
little bit more about what this manager told you? So the manager said that his
direct report, the employee, she's a woman who's
been in the company for the last eight years and
has performed really well. She surfaced the
issue of not getting as many promotions as she felt like some of her other
colleagues were getting. She felt that she
was putting in a lot of work in terms of
sheer number of hours which by itself may not be a
good gauge of performance, but we also know that in terms
of performance indicators, she's brought in a
lot to the company. But this, the perception that she has, is that she's not
getting the same kind of growth opportunities that some
of her male colleagues are getting is very very
concerning for me. Is that something
that you've heard, otherwise do you
have any theories about why that might be the case? I don't exactly know. We should probably look at
the data but definitely, there's a pattern and it's worth investigating a little bit more. Okay, great. And, you know, what do
you think - you mentioned that you had heard others' kind of,
complaints maybe through your current reports from your other HR business partners. Do you have instances
where you've heard very concrete things about
some of these issues? Uh, yes. Are you talking specifically
about the women employees? Yes. We've had one
particular group, it's based out of
Seattle and we've seen a lot of churn in women
employees in that group. So, I am just connecting the
dots and wondering if possibly that's an
issue that is related. Okay, terrific. Now I want you to think back
to the last time that you interacted with the specific data that I mentioned earlier. So again, that's employee
polls and also the hiring, termination, and promotion data. Can you tell me about the
last time you interacted with that data and what exactly
that interaction was about. So I mentioned earlier that when it comes to the employee
surveys I'm very, very closely
associated with that. One of the key things
that I look into it is to see what's the
morale at the company, from a different demographic
standpoint and at overall company level so that's something that I
keep a close tab on. Good. What did you find? So if I understand
correctly, the new poll has just been conducted, but what about the last poll? Did you do any analysis on it?
Did you discover anything? We did. So we look at the
data from two standpoints, just the absolute scores, and then we also get text data. We read the employee
comments to get a sense of how our
employee's feeling at the company but we also look separately at the
numerical scores. There we sense that on average the company
morale is really high. We haven't drilled down into details from a
demographic standpoint. But overall, we feel like
we're doing really well. We also got recognition from external agencies
which give you best work or workplace awards and we've received that
nomination for the last three years
in a row and we were recognized for the last
three years in a row. It sounds like things
are going quite well for the company in
terms of its culture. Did the last poll surface anything that might be an area
that you want to address? I think, growth, promotions, long-term career growth at the company that's something
that again has surfaced. Then the other aspect
we've seen is that there's a dichotomy in our data in terms of how
employees feel about the pace of change and
innovation in the company. We see some sets of
data which suggest that employees are really happy with how we are proceeding
with things. But then we have some data that suggests that
employees are extremely dissatisfied and they want faster pace of change
and innovation to occur. Okay, terrific. Anything
else along those lines? That's about it. Let me this time ask you to speculate a
little bit about what you're expecting to
find possibly with the latest round of data. What kinds of trends
or patterns do you think you'd expect to find, especially based on what
you know about the company? I mentioned earlier that in the Seattle region we're seeing a higher
level of attrition, especially among women employees. I'm anticipating that our scores, especially with regards to career development and especially the overall satisfaction might be lower over in that
particular group. We also measure an index
called innovation and change. I'm anticipating again there repeat of this
dichotomy to occur, where some groups feel very
positive about it and others feel like we need to pace up the rate of change
and innovation. Okay, terrific. Now you might have heard that
I've been asked to do a quantitative data analysis on this data that
we're talking about. I'm hoping to find evidence of some of the trends
that you notice. Are there any other
trends that you can think of that I might look into? I would recommend looking at the rate of
promotions that occur, especially since that data
comes from the HRIS system, it's easy to know by gender, by different other
demographic groups. I would say speaking with some of our other
senior managers and getting that direct pulse from
people would also be helpful so those two might be good sources
of information for you. Okay, terrific.
Thank you so much. Those are all the
questions I have for you. If anything else occurs
to you at any point, please get in touch with
me, you have my email. Otherwise, I'll let you
know the results of what I find here and
then eventually of our data analysis and I'm sure you'll be
interested in that. Do you have any questions for me or anything else
you'd like to add? No, that's about it.
Thank you so much. All right. Thank you. Alright so, that
was a sample interview, it was probably much shorter than the interviews that
you will do yourself. As you saw, the interview
protocol itself was shorter, relatively short for a 30
to 60 minute interview. You could see that if this was a situation with a lot more data, that she would likely have had a lot more to say
about the data itself so the time is something that will adjusted based on the complexity of the data-set that
you're working with. That is the conclusion of this sample interview. Thank you.
