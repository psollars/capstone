Frequently, you'll hear that data scientists need to have very good communication skills. In fact, according
to some people who study data science as a field, they find that the one of
the most wanted skills in data scientists is good
storytelling ability, the ability to tell a good story, about the data analysis
they've conducted. Now storytelling is a key
element of any kind of communication because it
helps with understanding, it helps people remember what it is that they were exposed to, and ultimately it's very
effective as a way to persuade. So if you want your data analysis to actually persuade
other people, then you want to be
a good storyteller on top of having done
a good data analysis. In this segment, what
we're going to talk about is how to take the qualitative data analysis that you've done and turn it into a report that has
elements of good storytelling. Now the reason why people talk
about storytelling is that ultimately it is about telling a good story, and what
makes a story a story? Well first of all it
will tend to have a plot and I don't
mean the kind of plot that you see in movies where
let's say girl meets boy, girl gets ignored by boy, and then ultimately she
wins the boy's heart. That's the kind of
typical plot that you see it in a romantic
story, let's say. But the kind of stories that you're going to tell are
also going to have a plot. So a typical plot in any
kind of presentation will be for example that you go
through the background first, then you might have
some questions, then you'll show how
you did the analysis and finally you will answer
some of those questions. But it's also possible to tell different kinds of stories. So for example, you might
decide you're going to lead with the answers and then only after you present
the answers to go back into how you ultimately
arrived at them. That's also effective
depending on the context. The most important
thing about a story is that all of the
things that you're saying are organized in a meaningful way and not
just at this high level, but also at a very
detailed level. So within each of the sections
of your overall story, you might also be thinking through: what should I say first, what comes next, and so on. You always want to
have some kind of rational order for why you're saying things
in what order. Then finally a good
story is something that keeps the reader or the listener interested and here
what you really want to think about is when you're
thinking about the order, what's the best thing
to present next so that the people who will be absorbing your story are always wanting to hear what
you're going to say next. There aren't really any
great hard rules for writing good stories but what
we're going to do is practice this skill in the
context of writing a report. So in this course you're
going to be writing a report about the
qualitative findings that you found through
your interviews and through your affinity walls, but in a way that sets up a potential future
quantitative analysis. So you can think
of all of the work that you've done in
this course as a way of understanding what somebody
who's a data analysis, maybe you, would actually do next as a way to
understand that data set. Your affinity wall
actually has done a lot of the work of
helping you create a story because it's basically created the clusters
which means that a lot of the organization of the
individual pieces of information that you have have already been put into
different sections. But what remains to
be done is now you have to order all of
that information. Like so different
kinds of evidence, you want to make sure that they're ordered in a
way that's effective in conveying the
ultimate summaries that you have and then
among the summaries, you want to make sure you
think about what summaries are worth presenting first
and so on and so forth. One thing I'll say is
that anytime I'm thinking through a presentation
or a report, it takes quite a bit of effort to get this
ordering right, and I'll tweak the order
over and over again throughout the process
of writing the report or putting together
the presentation. I find that even after you've done the
actual data analysis, this figuring out the ordering, figuring out the transitions, figuring out how information
connects to each other is a critical part of presenting the information and your
analysis to somebody else. Some other things to think about when you're
constructing a story, it's really important that
you understand the audience. For this course of course your audiences is just, imagine it's a future data analyst
who's going to take your qualitative analysis
and start from there. But in other contexts you might be presenting to, let's say, the CEO of a company, you might be presenting to an audience of people who
care about the issue, you might be presenting to a bunch of citizens
who are really interested in
understanding what you've uncovered, but understanding
the audience and what they're interested in and what ultimately motivates them is really important in figuring out a good story and a good way
to present the information. Another important thing
about storytelling is you want to prioritize
what's important. So the last thing you
want to do is just say, well here's a one finding,
here's another finding, here's yet another finding
and so on and just keep going through findings
in a very flat way. That often received as
monotonic and boring frankly. What you want to do is say, all the findings that I found, what's really
important is this one and the reason why it's
important is because of this and here's another thing
that's important and you might end up not presenting
all of the other data, even though you can
always leave it in an appendix or leave
it for Q and A. The other thing is
that it's found in cognitive science that
people tend to remember the beginnings and ends
of things better than things that happened
in the middle and so for this reason, if you can, you want to arrange the ordering of some of
the stories that you're telling in such a way that the most important information is either at the
beginning or the end, or even repeated and of course since we're
talking about, in this case, qualitative data, you want to make sure that you're
not overreaching. You want to hedge
as necessary say, "We suspect based on some of the things that we
found from our interviews, that certain kinds of trends
will exist in the data and that needs to be
confirmed either through further data analysis
or data collection." Then ultimately a
great way to become a better storyteller is
to read other reports, especially ones that
you find to be good, and kind of break them apart, break them down and see how
they're telling the story, what are they saying
in the introduction? How are they presenting
the analysis? What's the relationship between the individual findings in their reports and the ultimate
conclusions that they draw? In the final report that
you'll write for this course, you're going to write
basically about what your qualitative research suggests you should investigate through a future
quantitative data analysis. There are more details
in the assignments please see that. Thank you.
