I've got Chris and
myself here today, and we're going to be
interviewing Kevin Hartman. Kevin is the director
of Analytics in Google. He's going to talk to
us about what he does, and how he brings
value to Google, and his insights on marketing, on Analytics, and on data itself. Kevin, why don't you introduce
yourself and give us some background on how you
got to where you are now. Absolutely, great.
Good to see you guys. Thank you so much
for inviting me. Also, I want it known
right up front, I am a Michigan guy. I grew up in Mount Pleasant,
right in the center. Spent many of my finest
years in Michigan, so very happy to be
here speaking with you all. I am Kevin Hartman. Director of Analytics
means that I lead a team, the Google Media sales side, that works with advertisers
to better construct campaigns that those advertisers
will run on YouTube, on Google search, on any of the display advertising
media that we offer. That includes both
insight work that we will do to just improve the
effectiveness of those campaigns, targeting of those campaigns, as well as the back-end
measurement and proof that the campaigns
actually worked, that they wind up having
some desired effect. I have always worked in data, whether it was in
my stent working in the public sector
and government, to the consulting work that
I did to then working in an advertising agency
running analytics for a long time as well. I think that's been
a constant theme. I was fortunate enough right around 10 years ago to
wind up coming on over to Google to do many of the things that I've
been doing at other places. Just Google's a
whole new ballgame. I have been really happy doing the work
that I do here now. When you started out, what
kinds of technologies were you using yourself to do this work? Both to do the analysis, but then also to orchestrate
it and keep track of things? Sure. Great questions. When I was hands-on keyboard, I was using MySQL. I was using a lot of
throughput products, and I don't even
remember their names any longer, to be honest. I was using SAS and SPSS. Eventually, I became very enamored with
[inaudible] overtime. I still have not been
able to master Python, but I'm one of those people with firm belief that you really should choose one or the other, and never the
[inaudible] should mix. But I've also developed into Tableau and other data
visualization tools. But full disclosure,
once you get to Google, we've got a lot of homegrown
tools that we use here, either Data Studio
or the way that we access data internally. Then, in my role today, frankly, working with large advertisers, there are a lot of analytics
tools we use for sure, but I spend a lot of
my time working with third-party measurement
vendors like Nielsen's and others in constructing
their experiments. So I move a little away from the hands-on tools into more of the application of those
tools more broadly. Pre-COVID, what does a typical
day look like for you? The irony about it is
that it doesn't look, in many ways, that different. Google is a very
connected company. I lead a team of around 80 people that we
are all over the map. So I spent a great
deal of my time going from video conference to video conference,
back to back to back. In Google's culture,
for the most part, every meeting is a
30-minute meeting. I will in the course
of an eight-hour day have 16 of those
just lined right up. Pre-COVID the only thing
you would add would be a nice commute
down to our office, the West Side of Chicago
in the Fulton Market area, and then a free lunch. Those are the things
that I've missed out on, as well as the trip
to the barista that you traditionally do
in the afternoon. A lot of meeting with people, a lot of virtual
meetings with my team, and a fair amount
of travel as well, just to go see customers go visit my teams in different areas. All of that now just keeps me seated right here flowing through these video conferences. Random fact about your office, at least if it's still the same way it was the
last time I was in there. There are random 'Did
You Know Facts?', in the bathroom stalls. There are. It's interesting
that you know that. There is something that we call, I can't even remember it now, it's coding in the Jan, maybe. Don't quote me on that.
It's something like that. They are coding directives that engineers swap out very
frequently in those areas. Yes, they are there, indeed. I've been in your
Chicago location for a while which is how I know that. Yes. It's not unfair to say that
your team is responsible or is responsible for helping with one of Google's
primary profit centers, which is advertising revenue; is that an unfair classification? No, it is the revenue center. It's 90 whatever percent
of our revenue today is the ads that we
want to serve to you as a consumer when you come watch videos on YouTube
or come to Google.com. Can you tell us a little
bit about the data you're collecting and how you're making decisions around that data? Absolutely. All of this is
anonymized and consent-driven. Unlike a place like say, Facebook where you
have to be signed in, we do allow people to come to YouTube and watch
videos without signing in, no personal identification,
then it's done. We allow people to opt out of location tracking and
location history. You don't get the
benefits of Google Maps, but you can still opt out of that product or
make that decision. You can search without having to have it tied back to
your profile as well. But when you are tied
to your profile, we're looking at what you're watching, how you're behaving, the ads that you skip, those that you watch
all the way through. We're looking at the categories of searches that you're conducting and what it
is you're looking for. What we're doing primarily then, is rolling that into
an anonymized sort of aggregate consumer segment that you will fit or what we
call interest categories. You can actually see it at, I believe it's
google.com/ads/preferences. We actually show you what interest categories
we think fits you as a person based on all of those
markers that I talked about. The whole intent there
is for us to serve you ads that are relevant to you. We don't want to show you
things you don't want to see. You're going to see
ads. Again, it's how we make our money. The alternative is that you pay for your Google
searches, right? Or you do the monthly YouTube Red and then you don't have ads. But we are trying to
create an experience for you at our Google properties that will keep you coming back because we want you to come back. That's much of the information that we are tracking
and collecting. I want to freaking talk about
your team a little bit. What kinds of backgrounds do
people on your team have? What kind of skills do you have? Also, when you're hiring
and building the team, what kind of soft skills
are you looking for? Sure. How does that look and what are your philosophies
around that? All great questions.
To be honest, I'm probably looking at soft skills more than anything
because the hard skills, have become pretty democratized. When we're hiring for our roles, we are looking for
people who are curious. We are looking for
people who have great attention to detail and
take pride in their work, and we're looking for
people who are optimistic. When you can fit those
things into the ability to have a data strategy
point of view, meaning the ability to connect data that you're
collecting to some kind of business decision and have the understanding and the
context that is needed to translate that data for a non-analysts in
the business world. The technological hard
skills like I talked about, that you can collect data, analyze data, manage data. Then importantly, what we call the data designer or the data storytelling aspect. Being able to take this
stuff and make some narrative out of it,
develop a hypothesis, prove or disprove it, and then tell, again, a non-analyst what the data says. Soft skills there and hard
skills and somebody who can, when I'm talking to students
or talking to prospective When I'm talking to candidates, someone who can stand in front of me and link their left brain and right brain really shows me that they can do those things, they have the hard skills that are exhibited
on the left side, and they can tell these stories, and demonstrate the curiosity, and do the right things
on the right side. That in a nutshell, I think, are the things that
we're looking for. Can you talk about Google's use within your
area of machine learning, and how you'd use
machine learning, and where it works well, and where it has
failed spectacularly? Absolutely. There
are all examples. It is a fantastic, absolutely crucial tool for us. What machine learning does is, you all know this, I'm sure, but it looks at past history, looks at data in the past, and will discern relationships
and patterns and things that we just wouldn't see
any way or any other way. We will use that,
machine learning, to classify you as someone
who's interested in boating, or someone who's interested in baseball, or whatever it is. Those interest categories
that I talked about, those are all machine
learning driven. It's not an analyst like me
looking at it and saying, "I think this is the
baseball lover," it's a machine figuring that out. That's one of the ways
that we'll use it. We'll also use it in measurement. I mean, in the
analytics environment that we are in today, with privacy such a concern, and the degradation
and deprecation of third-party cookies and other identifiers that
we've always used, we are going to have a
much more difficult time tracking someone's path through the World Wide Web and understanding how
advertising influenced them. I mean, that's a big
part of what I do. As that data disappears, we are turning more and more to machine learning to help us with what we call probabilistic models complete those paths. I might not be able to see
you all the way through, probably even worse
than I was before, but I'm able to use
machine learning and other heavy technologies to complete that picture
a little better. That's another way
that we're using it. It fails when there are
no humans involved. I was just sharing
this the other day. One of my favorite examples,
and you can look this up, is some work that Google led in image classification
using machine learning. You're basically training
machines to just identify what is a guitar, or what is an automobile, and find one of the early
pictures of dumbbells, the weights that you lift. It's hilarious because what a machine learning algorithm
believed the dumbbell was, was the correct two pieces
of metal with a joining bar, and then a disembodied
hand that's fixed to it because every picture that it saw of a dumbbell
had a hand on it. It's creepy as all get out, but it's a perfect example of how these machines are great
at identifying patterns, but they don't
always get it right, and they need humans to
really step in and add the intuition and make the
real decisions for them. In your workflow, in your team, do you have
human-in-the-loop workflows, and how do you leverage that
and take advantage of it? Yeah. The interesting
thing about Google, and one of the things
that I love about it, is that I don't need to go out and build
many tools anymore. Particularly, the
machine learning algorithms that are constructed
are all given to me, I just become a consumer of
those things and my team. We are the ones who
are able to use that technology as an
input into our decisions. We are the ones that
get to figure out, all right, how do
I position this? Is this the right context? How do I use this
input, this tool, to influence a marketer or someone who is trying
to decide if they should give their
next marketing dollar to Facebook,
television, or Google. It puts us in a great position because being bootstrapped like I was in a previous life in an advertising agency
where you're just trying to piece together
anything you can, we have an embarrassment of
riches when it comes to that. But more to your question, it allows us to play
that human role. All the way through,
it is what we do. There are so many tools and inputs that we are
able to choose from, it relies on us
being the human in the process to make
it worthwhile, to make those tools really work. I'll be honest. When we set up this call, I immediately went
online and Googled you and found that you
had written a book. You're not asking me
to plug the book, but I'm plugging the book
here. I'm not even halfway. I'm just in a few
chapters into this, but the title got me. This is Digital
Marketing Analytics: In Theory And In Practice. My immediate question was, how does the theory
differ from the practice? Where does the theory say this
is how things should work, and then you get
into the practice and that's not how things work. Yeah, I think I painted
with the theory and some of the frameworks that I've used in the book
and that I've used, that book is a culmination of the 30 whatever years that
I've been doing this. It's things that I've learned that helped
me along the way, but frameworks like the
consumer decision journey, ideas and concepts of the
zero moment of truth. The process that we use
to identify hypotheses, test them with data we collected and then all
the visualization work, is an idealized state. I think the practice, it doesn't hold up when
in a couple of ways, either when that client
meeting gets moved from Friday to tomorrow and suddenly you don't have
nearly as much time. It doesn't get applied. Frankly, when I see, and I've seen a lot of
this in my careers, you see just bad marketers or people who don't
exhibit intuition who aren't willing to make
risks and they're not using any of these concepts, any theoretical approach to
the decisions that they make. They just want to get into
the data and get right down into the weeds, and they want everything
to be perfect and it just isn't perfect. Then I think the other way that the theory doesn't apply to the practice when we frankly as analysts get sloppy. That happens, we're human
and we're prone to it. If you deviate, you cut corners, if you start to introduce bias
into the work that you do, then you just wind up
in the wrong place. The theory is
definitely idealized. I understand it, but those instances of the practice not holding to the theory are, I think, fortunately
not the majority of the experiences that
you'll have as an analyst. Make some predictions here. Actually, let me ask
this in two ways. Sure. What's been the biggest change in the last five years for
the work that you've been doing and what do you think the biggest change in the
next five years will be? It's not probably the
sexiest of answers, but it's a pretty easy one. I mean, the biggest
change has just been the enormous amount of data, the culmination of
data, processing power, and our ability to really
make sense of that. That has all come together. I mean, five years ago, location history and location
tracking to know if someone saw my ad on YouTube and then wound
up going into my store, I didn't have that like I do now. I can make those
sorts of connections. As long as we can
respect the idea of consumer consent and privacy, that has been the biggest change. In five years it is all about consumer
consent and privacy. I think where we'll
see measurement go, again with Apple and their Intelligent Tracking
Prevention is introduced, and what GDPR means in the European Union and whatever we'll have
here in the US, means that we'll have
much more regulated use of personal data. What that means for
marketers is probably a greater reliance on technology to create the measurement, to make the insight, create the insight,
than we were before. I think we'll be
able to do it with less data using bigger and
more powerful machines, which to the conversation
that we're having, just makes even more necessary
the role of the analyst, someone who then make
sense of that stuff. Which means that anyone
who is a student of analytics today is
in the right field, I would say, and on their
way to a successful career. Speaking of students
of analytics, which most of our
students would call themselves in one
form or another. What's some advice for them both as they leave this program
and go for the job market? Also, in their jobs, once they start, you mentioned the left-brain,
right-brain side of things. But what are some of
the things that they can do to provide that value back other
than buy ads with you? Yes, right. Click on a lot of search ads is
what I always tell them, and don't skip your YouTube ads are the things that they
can do to really help. I would say, the
advice that I have is it links back to what Chris
and I were talking about. I would say think of
yourself as having three functional roles that you have to be able
to demonstrate. That idea of the
Business strategists or the Data strategists, that idea of your technical
hard skill functions. Then the idea of being a
designer and a storyteller and just try to balance
all three of those things. There was a time when companies would hire people
for one specific role, and those days are gone. Now you need to do at all. You can do it. I would
say balance those things. Then once you're in a role, I think probably the best advice that
I could give someone is don't think about your career, particularly in
analytics, as linear. You will get in. You will see that I am
in an analytics team, and I've got a boss, and that boss has a boss. In five years, who knows where
this thing is going to be? I think there is so much
opportunity for analytics that I think everybody's
idea and conception of what an analytics
program looks like, it's going to change quite a bit. I would say, be willing
to take risks and just operate on the
cutting edge of that and be interested and curious in what's
coming next and what are the things that
technology can bring to improve these data in your organization and
try to get into that. One last question that I've been asking all the people
we've interviewed, and I'll ask it in two ways. What are your or your team's favorite tooling
that other people can use? The open-source tools
or commercial tools? Obviously not like
internal Google things. I just find it to be,
and particularly for me, and maybe it's because I've
got a sweet spot for it. It's what I always use, but the unlimited capability. I'm in awe of some of
the people who use it. Hadley Wickham is someone that I've known for a long time, and love what he's done and what the
RStudio team has done. I look at someone like Nathan
Yau in flowingdata.com, and the tutorials
just blow my mind. My analysts use it. It's a tool that when we
need to move a lot of data, we will use it in
our secure privacy, safe areas on our laptops
to conduct our analysis. It's a tool that, on the engineering side of
the house at Google, is used widely as well. It's something that is
pretty pervasive here, and something that I've always
loved and my team loves. Any other tools other than R? As I said, most of the other
things that we use are, say, Data Studio, which
is a Google product. We use all the Google
productivity suite and Sheets and Slides, and Docs. My team can be outfitted pretty well with our Google
internal tools. The customer-face are the ones
that I just talked about. The ones that aren't
customer-facing, that we use as well. Then our Tableau, and we're pretty good
to go, to be honest. I've got some people
that are using Python and some other more even TensorFlow and some of the other tools they've
googled that google has. But that makes for a pretty
complete set for my analysts. No, I think this has been a
really great conversation. I've really appreciated
the insights around the work you're doing and the character
of your team. It's been great. Thank you so much for
your talk, gentlemen. Of course, guys, it was really, really nice to speak with you. Thanks for inviting me, and
thanks for taking the time. Pleasure. Thank you.
