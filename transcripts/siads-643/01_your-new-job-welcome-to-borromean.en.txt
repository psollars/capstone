Hi, welcome. Today I want to
talk about some of the structure we have
set up for this class. I'm a firm believer that the real-world does not take the form of a
written assignment. In classes, you're handed
a written assignment, it typically has an introduction, it tells you exactly
what we're expecting, sometimes it even tells
you how to complete the task and you turn
in the assignment. We grade it. We sometimes get feedback, sometimes we don't,
sometimes it's auto graded, and then you move on to
the next assignment. That works great in a classroom. The problem is when you
get to the real world, that's not how things work, that's not what we do
in the real world. So what I'd like to
talk a little bit about is how this
class tries to mimic the real-world as closely as we can within a
classroom setting. To do that, I'd
like to welcome you all to Borromean Digital. You've now been hired
at Borromean Digital. HR says, "You've passed
your background check. Congratulations. We're excited to have you as a member
of this team." Kelly Davenport is our CTO. Borromean is a fake company. It doesn't actually exist. It's very obvious this
company doesn't exist if you go to their website,
borromean.digital. This is a framework
we use in this class. Some of your homework
assignments, will take the format
as if you are communicating with
your coworkers. At a job, for those
of you who had jobs, you're familiar with this;
for those of you who are about to go out and get jobs, most of your work
does not come from a faculty member or
a professor saying, "I have an assignment
for you to do it." It comes from someone in your company asking
you for information. So the following people are
going to be those people who ask you for information
here at Borromean. So I want to review some of
their personas with you, so that when you get
an e-mail from them, and an email is code
for an assignment, you know where
they're coming from. Let's start off with our CTO. Our CTO is Kelly Davenport. She has two degrees, one of them is an
MBA from Harvard. She is not actually
a technical person. She's a business person. She's not going to understand
technical details, but she understands the
business of Borromean Digital. By the way, I don't know what Borromean Digital's
actual business is, if you figure that
out, let me know. She is your boss's boss's boss. She has three cats and one dog. She likes to read the physical
newspaper in the morning. We used to get newspapers printed and they were delivered. She still likes to
read one of those. She's in her early '50s
and she's married to Ian, who actually works at Borromean here at the product department, and there's a lot of drama. Raj, he is your
direct supervisor. He has a CS degree from Oxford. He likes to tinker
with Amazon Alexa. He used to be on the web team
here at Borromean Digital. He's 43 years old
and has been here for the last 10 years. In his personal life,
he's been married to Eve for three years and has one very, very fat cat. Kim is our director of security. Has been here for five years. Started in development,
then moved up through DevOps and now runs the
security department. Has four dogs and loves racing, not the dogs, cars. He's unhappy because
somebody keeps going into his desk drawer and
takes candy out of it. Lawrence, finally. Lawrence is our head
of our research group. Lawrence looks for new
products and investments. He started as an
analyst 11 years ago. In his personal life, he got married to
Nadine last week. So these are the primary people
who you will be receiving communications from
throughout this class, or throughout your tenure
here at Borromean Digital. They will communicate with you, and some of them have greater or less knowledge
around technology, and so when you're
communicating back to them, when you're answering their
questions, keep that in mind. This leads to ambiguity. This class has a decent amount of intentional ambiguity.
What do I mean by that? Well, in a real-world, you're not handed
an assignment and told exactly how to
complete the assignment. We do that in classes and
we do that in places where we need to use
auto-graders because the auto-grader has to
be able to interpret it. But here we put some ambiguity
into our assignments. Don't get me wrong. Some
of them are going to be very clear cut, this is what you do,
this is how you do it. Some of them are going
to be a little bit of replicating aspects
of the real world. So when in doubt, there's
a couple options. If you read an assignment and
you're not sure what to do, do what you would do in the
real-world, ask questions. Go on Slack, ask some questions. You can e-mail us
and ask questions. Or do the work and provide a solution and provide
context with your response. It's not wrong to say, for a written response, "I read your request, I interpreted it
this way and here's how I provided the response." Oftentimes there'll be two
or three different ways to respond to a problem, and as long as you're not
completely out of left field, you'll be fine from a
grading perspective.
