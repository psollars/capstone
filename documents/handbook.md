# Academics

## Master of Applied Data Science (MADS)

The curriculum of the Master of Applied Data Science is evolving to meet your needs. Rather than reproduce details of the program here, we ask that you refer to [MADS Degree Requirements (Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mTgmzn42DYNm6G1DPvfVN7oLK5ADLxFWXliIW4aqTNQ/edit) and the appropriate section of the[ Master of Applied Data Science Student Orientation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/siads-orientation/home/week/1) for information about the MADS curriculum, degree requirements, and academic planning and course scheduling. This handbook includes policies, procedures, program and service offerings, and other helpful information.

### Summary of Degree Requirements

To earn a Master of Applied Data Science at the School of Information, you must complete a minimum of 34 credit hours of SIADS coursework, with a cumulative grade point average of a B (3.0) or better, including required coursework and electives.

## Drop/Add Policy

You can drop courses in Wolverine Access up to one week after each session begins without incurring monetary penalties or a “W” (indicating withdrawal) on your transcript. The drop/add deadlines for each MADS session are posted on the Office of the Registrar’s website under [Student Registration Deadlines](http://ro.umich.edu/calendar/) (click “Master of Applied Data Science Online Program” under Professional School Calendars).

After the drop/add deadline, you may request a late drop in Wolverine Access. A “W” (indicating withdrawal) is posted for courses dropped after the drop/add deadline, regardless of the reason for the drop. The deadline to submit your request for a late drop (withdrawal) is 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the last day of the current MADS session.

Adding classes after the drop/add deadline requires an [online](https://csprod.dsc.umich.edu/htmldoc/eng/dftie/lsaa/htm/sr_ss_latedropaddform.html) late add request in Wolverine Access. The instructor should also email [umsi.registrar@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.registrar@umich.edu) to request that a seat be opened for you.

## Waitlists

MADS courses are delivered in such a way that waitlists are generally not necessary. However, if you are unable to register for a course that you have all necessary prerequisites for, please email the UMSI Registrar Team at [umsi.registrar@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.registrar@umich.edu) for assistance with registration. If you cannot register for a course due to missed prerequisites, please contact the MADS Academic Advising Team at [umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu) for assistance with your academic plan.

## Overrides/Permission to Enroll

It is unlikely that MADS students will need overrides; however in the event where a MADS course requires one please follow the protocol listed below. If Wolverine Access is not allowing you to register for a course, and there are seats available, please request an override by emailing the UMSI Registrar Team at [umsi.registrar@umich.edu](mailto:umsimadshelp@umich.edu). Provide the following information in your email request for an override: your name, student ID number, term (fall, winter, or spring/summer), catalog number (e.g., SIADS 501), and section number (001, 002, etc.). Once an override is approved, your override will be processed and you will receive a confirmation email indicating that you may register online. Please allow two business days for your override to be processed. _Receiving an override does not enroll you in the course; you must register through Wolverine Access to claim the seat that has been opened for you._

## Independent Study

Students who want to pursue an independent research project or explore a data science topic not currently being offered within an existing course may consider enrolling in an independent study course(s). Students may count a maximum of two (2) Independent Study credits toward the MADS degree. To enroll in an independent study course, SIADS 691: Independent Study, propose a paper or project to a UMSI faculty member (mentor). Students may identify a mentor from all regular UMSI faculty, clinical faculty, lecturers III and IV, as well as faculty with courtesy appointments. With the faculty member, determine one (1) to two (2) credits of work. Content, assignments, meeting times, and grade requirements are arranged with the faculty member; however the expected scope of work should roughly comply with the one (1) credit per month MADS model. It is encouraged, although not required, to enroll in back-to-back SIADS 691 sessions if electing two (2) credits.

## Visiting (“Auditing”) a SIADS Course

“Visiting” is the official University term for taking a class for no grade and no credit toward your degree. This is also commonly referred to as “auditing” a course. Per University policy, students who are attending (or auditing) a class must register and pay the appropriate tuition and fees.

To audit a class (also known as an official visit), you must first register for the class as you normally would, then use an election form (available from the UMSI Registrar Team at [umsi.registrar@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.registrar@umich.edu)) to request a change to official visit status. The form must be signed by the instructor and by the UMSI Registrar or your MADS academic advisor. Then you submit the form to the U-M Registrar’s Office.

It is up to you and the faculty member to agree on expectations for the audit, though typically students are expected to attend class, participate, and complete assignments (and even tests), though they would receive a grade of “VI” for visitor instead of receiving academic credit with a letter grade. Students who need a class for credit will receive priority for seats. Students may not change their status to official visit after the last day of class.

## Petition for Modification or Waiver of Policy

The ​​School​ of Information policies​ are detailed in this student handbook. ​​All​​ School policies ​​have ​​been ​​formulated ​​with ​​one ​​objective:​​ the ​​pursuit ​​of ​​academic​ ​quality.​​ This ​​goal requires​​ that​​ the ​​policies ​​be ​​equitably ​​and ​​uniformly ​​applied​ ​to ​​everyone.​ ​However, the School of Information does recognize the infrequent occurrence of extenuating circumstances that warrant individual consideration. School of Information students may petition the school for a modification or waiver of any UMSI policy by submitting a [UMSI Petition Form](https://forms.gle/F6oxKLBQUXPEBhX5A). ​​In completing the form, state in writing all facts that have a bearing on the case you wish to present. If the petition involves a course, it must also be endorsed by the instructor. ​Please note that a reduction in time to degree, a reduction in tuition, or a reduction in final term enrollment are not extenuating circumstances for a modification or waiver of policy. If you’d like to submit a [UMSI Petition Form](https://forms.gle/F6oxKLBQUXPEBhX5A), please first contact the MADS Academic Advising Team at [umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu) to discuss your petition request with an advisor.

## Term Withdrawal

To withdraw from all classes/credits for a given term, you must submit a term withdrawal form, available from the UMSI Registrar Team (umsi.registrar@umich.edu) and have approval from the School of Information. If you must withdraw from the term, it is strongly recommended that you do so before the start of the term to avoid [registration and disenrollment fees](https://umich-regoff.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1229), or by the drop/add deadline to avoid a “W” (indicating withdrawal) on your transcript and additional monetary penalties. Please contact the MADS Academic Advising Team at [umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu) to discuss your academic plan prior to withdrawing.

## Leave of Absence

If you decide to take a leave of absence and have not yet used the online course registration, you do not need to submit any paperwork, but should notify the MADS Academic Advising Team at [umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu) of your intentions. If you have already registered for classes you will need to submit a term withdrawal form available from the UMSI Registrar Team (umsi.registrar@umich.edu).

To register for classes following a term in which you were not enrolled, you will need to contact the Office of the Registrar by email at [ro.registration.questions@umich.edu](mailto:ro.registration.questions@umich.edu), or phone 734.764.6280 / 734.647.3507, to request a registration appointment assignment. If using email, please include name, UM ID number, term, and school or college in which you wish to register.

Students not enrolling within a year (12 months) will have to apply for readmission to UMSI.

## Time Limit

Students are expected to complete all coursework within five years from the date of first enrollment in the program. Students exceeding this time limit must file a petition for modification or waiver of policy. Petitions must describe explicitly the amount of work remaining and a timeline for completion. Students must be making good progress and have good academic standing to receive an extension. A student who does not complete degree requirements within five years and does not petition for an extension may be withdrawn from the program and required to apply for readmission.

## Grades and Grading Policy

To earn a Master of Applied Data Science degree from the University of Michigan School of Information, you must complete a minimum of 34 credit hours of graduate coursework, with a minimum cumulative grade average of B and a minimum grade of C- or greater in any course, including all required courses.

Within the 34 credit hours of graduate coursework, a minimum of 34 credits must be coursework taken within the MADS program (SIADS courses). Additionally, you must complete all Milestone and Capstone courses. Currently MADS does not accept transfer credit of any kind including credit earned from other academic programs or MOOC certificates.

### Letter Grades and Points

The method of grading is the letter-grade system (A, B, C, D, E), except for special courses as noted. Courses in which D or E grades are earned do not count for degree credit. Grades of + and – may be given to graduate students whenever such fineness of discrimination is possible. These letter grades are translated into points for each hour of credit in a course as indicated in the following table.

| Grade | Points | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A+    | 4.0    | Extraordinary achievement. Rarely given.                                                                                                                            |
| A     | 4.0    | Consistently distinguished performance in all course aspects, such qualities as analytical ability, creativity, and originality are exhibited at a very high level. |
| A-    | 3.7    | Strong, solid achievement in most aspects of the work.                                                                                                              |
| B+    | 3.3    | Good performance. Consistent with performance expected of students in a graduate degree program.                                                                    |
| B     | 3.0    | Acceptable                                                                                                                                                          |
| B-    | 2.7    | Borderline                                                                                                                                                          |
| C+    | 2.3    | Poor performance. This is a marginal grade which alerts students to their limited performance in a particular course.                                               |
| C     | 2.0    | Very poor performance                                                                                                                                               |
| C-    | 1.7    | Minimal. Performance not at a graduate student level.                                                                                                               |
| D+    | 1.3    | Significantly below standards for graduate work. Course does not count for degree credit. If given for a required course, the course must be repeated.              |
| D     | 1.0    | Extremely poor performance. Course does not count for degree credit. If given for a required course, the course must be repeated.                                   |
| D-    | 0.7    | Near failure. Course does not count for degree credit. If given for a required course, the course must be repeated.                                                 |
| E     | 0.0    | Failure. Course does not count for degree credit. If given for a required course, the course must be repeated.                                                      |

### Grade of Incomplete (I)

If a MADS student needs to drop a course, effort should be made to do so within the first week (or seven days) from when the course starts, before the MADS drop/add deadline. However, when extenuating circumstances prevent completion of coursework by the end of the MADS session, and the student participated in the course past the standard MADS drop/add deadline, a grade of incomplete (“I”) may be assigned.

To request an “I” grade for a course that has not been awarded a letter grade or course withdrawal (W), students must complete the [MADS Incomplete Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccjy5cRpEN5eljekRqiTJg_CK1ihFvvMa3y-BPj-82zXHH4g/viewform?usp=sf_link) as soon as possible, and no later than the last day of the MADS session (11:59 PM Eastern Time). After the request is submitted, an academic advisor will partner with the student to create a plan for resolution of the incomplete, typically through placement and participation in the course in a future session. Students with an active incomplete from a previous session are also required to meet with an academic advisor when requesting an incomplete.

The MADS Academic Advising team will notify the course instructor when a student’s request for an incomplete is approved so that an “I” can be submitted as the student’s final course grade.

An “I” grade is not calculated into the student’s term or cumulative GPA. The grade point average is based on credit hours of completed work.

An “I” grade can be changed to a letter grade only if the incomplete is resolved within one year (12 months) from the end of the term in which the course was started, regardless of the student’s subsequent enrollment status. If an “I” remains on a student’s record after that point, it becomes a lapsed incomplete, or a permanent “I” grade, and credit can only be earned by retaking the course under a new registration. Students planning to resolve the incomplete through placement and participation in a future session may be manually enrolled in the course one (1) time (within one year from the end of the term in which the course was started).

An incomplete has one of three statuses:

- Active Incomplete: The “I” grade is within the resolution deadline (within one year from the end of the term in which the course was started) and may be able to be changed to a letter grade and counted toward degree requirements.
- Resolved Incomplete: This status refers to a course that previously had an “I” grade, but has been subsequently completed and received a letter grade. The letter grade replaced the “I” grade.
- Lapsed Incomplete: An “I” grade that has passed the resolution deadline (one year from the end of the term in which the course was started) and is not eligible to be resolved. The lapsed incomplete remains on the transcript but will be excluded from the Degree Audit in Wolverine Access, as it does not count toward degree requirements.

For more information about requesting an “I” grade, please refer to the [MADS Incomplete Policy Student Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3vnEdnP8KyZR7delogoXGi2CTytSuFg03G53c5DYWM/edit#heading=h.9d2d25mpldb).

## Academic Standing

A student in good academic standing:

- Is making satisfactory progress toward the completion of degree requirements and is within the time limits of the degree program, including approved extensions;
- Has a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (B) or better;
- Has not been found to have breached the academic integrity policy, such as plagiarism or cheating, or other unethical practices in academic work. (Refer to the [Professional and Academic Integrity Policy](#academic-and-professional-integrity) for additional information.)

A student not making satisfactory academic progress may be required to meet with the Associate Director of Academic Programs to discuss whether the student may continue to enroll. Examples of not making satisfactory progress include withdrawing from the term, earning multiple W, I, or unsatisfactory grades in a term, and not making forward progress on degree requirements.

### Academic Probation

A student whose cumulative GPA falls below a B (3.0) in a given term, or who is not making satisfactory progress toward the completion of the degree, will be placed on academic probation for the following term of enrollment. Students placed on academic probation will be notified in writing and are required to meet with an academic advisor to discuss strategies and steps to return to good academic standing.

If a student has a GPA below a B (3.0) for two consecutive terms, UMSI may extend the probation, put a hold on registration, or have the student take a required academic break from courses.

Students on academic probation are required to periodically discuss their academic progress with an academic advisor to learn whether they are performing satisfactorily and making sufficient progress toward the degree. Upon raising the cumulative GPA above a 3.0, a student is returned to good academic standing.

#### Stages of Academic Probation

| Stage   | Status                           | GPA                                                                                                                                                   | Required Meeting                                                                             | Return to Good Standing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Required Academic Break and Dismissal

#### Required Academic Break

A required academic break may be assigned when a student is in severe academic difficulty for multiple terms. Students are expected to be out of registration for at least one full term during the required academic break. Specifically, if cumulative GPA is below 3.0 for two successive terms, or if a student is not making satisfactory progress towards a degree for two successive terms.

#### Reinstated on Academic Probation

When a student is required to take an academic break, the student must submit a reinstatement petition prior to returning to classes. The reinstatement petition must be submitted at least two months before the student’s intended term of return and within two weeks of meeting with an academic advisor and a member of the Academic Success Team.

Upon reinstatement approval and once a student returns, they will be placed on probation and will need to continue to make satisfactory academic progress towards degree completion and meet regularly with a member of the Academic Success Team.

When a required academic break has been assigned and if the student has not already been reinstated on probation, the student may appeal the action, in accordance with procedures established by the School of Information. The student will be required to explain in writing the particular reasons for the low academic performance and present a compelling argument why continuing enrollment or readmission should be permitted.

#### Dismissal

Students may be permanently dismissed from the School if continuation in the School is unlikely to lead to a degree. A student whose cumulative GPA continually falls below a 3.0, who is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree, or who is failing to demonstrate an ability to succeed in their academic program, may be dismissed from the program. A student with more than two terms of academic probation or with severe indicators of academic problems will be offered an opportunity to meet with the Executive Director of Academic and Student Affairs. After this meeting, a decision about academic dismissal will be made after careful consideration of all factors involved by the Academic Discipline Committee. The Academic Discipline Committee includes the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Executive Director of Academic and Student Affairs, and Director of Student Success and Residential Programs.

# Academic and Professional Integrity

We regard the highest standards of academic and intellectual integrity as crucial for information professionals in a civil society. In pursuit of our goal to educate future professionals, we treat any breach of academic and intellectual integrity as a learning opportunity. To respect the importance of integrity, we also assign appropriate and fair consequences for breaches. Students are expected to read, understand, and abide by all policies indicated in this handbook upon entry to the program.

If a faculty member identifies an occurrence of academic misconduct (some instructors may use applications or services to detect plagiarism), whether it is intentional or unintentional plagiarism (including improper attribution and citation), or any other breaches of academic integrity as outlined in this handbook, they are to report the incident to the Associate Director of Academic Programs and Student Life, who serves as the academic integrity officer for UMSI. The student will be asked to meet with them and will have the opportunity to discuss the situation fully.

The instructor will determine the consequences of a breach on the grade for the assignment and/or the final course grade. Additional sanctions may be imposed by the school. Sanctions related to academic misconduct may range from assignments such as educational readings, workshops, or writing a statement to demonstrate understanding of an issue, to dismissal from the program, depending on the nature of the offense.

A student with repeat instances of academic misconduct, or with a severe one-time instance, will be offered an opportunity to meet with the Executive Director of Academic and Student Affairs. In follow-up, a decision about academic dismissal will be made after careful consideration of all factors involved by the Academic Discipline Committee. The Academic Discipline Committee includes the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Executive Director of Academic and Student Affairs, and Associate Director of Academic Programs and Student Life.

A clear sense of academic and professional honesty and responsibility is fundamental to good scholarship. This policy statement has been written to affirm and clarify the general obligation of students to maintain high standards of academic and professional integrity. It defines some of the serious offenses of academic misconduct and outlines, in general terms, the standards to which students are held relative to professional conduct.

## Proctoring

In order to maintain standards of academic integrity and to mitigate risk of plagiarism there are occasions throughout the MADS program where students will be asked to participate in live proctored exams. These exams will likely be proctored by a third party company UMSI contracts with to manage the proctoring process. MADS students will know ahead of time when a test is proctored, and will have the opportunity to schedule proctoring at a time that is convenient for them.

## Understanding Plagiarism

At the University of Michigan, plagiarism (for example, using the writings or ideas of another without proper attribution) is considered a serious academic offense. Penalties for violators of academic policy regarding plagiarism range from loss of a grade to expulsion from the University. It is the responsibility of each student to understand what plagiarism is and the consequences of committing plagiarism, whether intentional or unintentional. There is a comprehensive overview of what constitutes plagiarism, especially as it relates to computer programming, in this Orientation. The University Library also offers[ information about plagiarism](https://www.lib.umich.edu/academic-integrity/understanding-plagiarism) and how you can protect yourself. Also see the “[Policy Statement on the Integrity of Scholarship](https://research-compliance.umich.edu/research-integrity)” on the U-M Research website. MADS students, as they complete their degree on Coursera, are required to uphold the[ Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) which includes registering for only one account, using your own work for homework, quizzes, and exams except when explicit permission is given to collaborate, not sharing solutions with others unless given explicit permission by the instructor, and not engaging in activities that will dishonestly improve or damage your results or the results of others. If a MADS student violates the Coursera Honor Code in a Coursera learning opportunity (MOOC, degree course, etc.) this is considered a violation of the UMSI MADS academic and professional integrity policy as well.

## The Roles and Responsibilities of Students

A clear sense of academic honesty and responsibility is fundamental to our scholarly community. To that end, UMSI and the University of Michigan expect their students to demonstrate honesty and integrity in all their academic activities. As professionals in training, students assume various roles depending on their coursework and activities. These include the roles of scholar/researcher, teacher, supervisor of employees, representative to the public (of the University, the discipline and/or the profession), and professional colleague and even the role of provider of services to clients. Therefore, students are responsible for maintaining high standards of conduct while engaged in coursework, research or thesis preparation, and other activities related to academics and their profession. Because students take on multiple roles in multiple settings, some types of conduct are both academic and professional in nature; hence, the inclusive nature of this policy. Educational training, like future professional life, includes demands that might tempt some students to violate integrity standards. There are pressures on students to achieve high grades, obtain financial support, meet research or publication deadlines, gain recognition from the scholarly community, and secure employment. Although faculty members can help students to maintain academic integrity despite these pressures, each student has final responsibility for maintaining integrity in their individual conduct. Finally, conduct that violates the ethical or legal standards of the University community or of UMSI may result in serious consequences, including immediate disciplinary action and future professional disrepute. In support of UMSI’s commitment to maintain high standards of integrity, this policy makes provisions for bringing forward and hearing cases of academic and professional misconduct.

## The Role of the UMSI Faculty and Others in the University Community

The UMSI faculty is accountable for maintaining high standards of academic and professional integrity and for serving as models in this regard. Many of the same policies and codes of conduct that apply to students also apply to faculty.

Since each of the roles played by a student carries with it some measure of public trust, the awarding of a university degree confers on its recipients some assurance of the individual’s suitability to bear that trust. Therefore, faculty and administrators associated with students’ education, both at the unit and central levels of the University, must hold students accountable according to these standards. Toward this end and taking into account the pressures on students that may lead to misconduct, faculty members are responsible for educating and mentoring students on matters of integrity and for monitoring students’ actions in this regard. Attention to matters of integrity should be given in both courses and research settings. Such guidance is particularly important for students as they assume independent roles as course assistants or begin to conduct their own original work. Traits that should be fostered are those that are common to all scholarship and also those that are unique to a particular specialization.

## Forms of Academic and Professional Misconduct

### Forms of Academic Misconduct

Offenses against the standards of academic integrity include the following:

- Cheating
- Plagiarism and other misappropriation of the work of another
- Falsification of data
- Improperly obtaining or representing laboratory or field data
- Dishonesty in publication
- Publication or attempted publication of collaborative work without the permission of the other participants
- Abuse of confidentiality
- Misuse of computer facilities
- Misuse of human subjects
- Falsification or unauthorized modification of an academic record
- Obstruction of the academic activities of another
- Other forms of academic misconduct that are commonly accepted within the scientific community
- Aiding or abetting academic misconduct
- Attempted academic misconduct

### Forms of Professional Misconduct

Professional misconduct is behavior that is inconsistent with ethical standards in any of the professional roles for which the student is being trained that is not covered by policies governing academic integrity. This may include the student’s performance in the role of researcher or scholar, teacher or mentor, supervisor, service-provider or colleague. Of particular note in this regard are behaviors that make the workplace hostile for colleagues, supervisors or subordinates. UMSI students are expected to adhere to ethical standards in a variety of work settings (e.g., offices, classrooms, and laboratories) within the explicit standards set by University policies. Language or behavior that is threatening, disruptive, abusive or hostile can make the workplace so unsafe or unpleasant that others cannot do their work. However, graduate education must take place in an environment in which free expression, free inquiry, intellectual honesty, and respect for the rights and dignity of others can be expected. Ethical standards of conduct should help ensure, not compromise, these features of the University environment. Sources of the norms or standards to which students can be held accountable (and charged under this policy if they fail to adhere to them) are as follows:

State and Federal Laws: Students, like all members of the University community, are expected to abide by all State and Federal laws.

Relevant University-Wide Policy Statements: Students are responsible for being familiar with, and are held accountable to, the formal norms or standards that are identified in University-wide policy statements and that apply to them, including the following. Please note that with the exception of the two policies that are specific to students (the final two policies on the list below), these standards apply to faculty as well as to graduate students.

- The Sexual Harassment Policy for Faculty and Staff (Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action).
- The Regents’ Bylaw on Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action.
- The Policy Statement on the Integrity of Scholarship and Procedures for Investigating Allegations of Misconduct in the Pursuit of Scholarship and Research, which applies to all instructional faculties and others in the institution as specified in the document.
- The Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities.
- The Student Policy on Alcohol and Other Drugs.

The text of these policies can be found on the U-M website. See also the Office of the Vice President for Research site on policies and research responsibility.

Specialization-Specific Professional Standards of Conduct or Codes of Ethic: Students are expected to meet professional standards of conduct associated with their own specialization and/or fields as articulated in formal codes of ethics. Such formal codes can include but are not limited to codes of professional conduct or codes of ethics published by professional associations. UMSI faculty and graduate students share responsibility in this regard. Faculty should make such policies available to students, and, in turn, students should take the initiative to familiarize themselves with such codes of conduct or ethics.

Additional Forms of Professional Misconduct: In addition, students can be held accountable for the following professionally relevant behaviors, which may or may not be identified as violations in other formal codes of conduct relevant to the student. With respect to the following behaviors, the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, in consultation with UMSI faculty, serves as the authority for whether a specific student behavior warrants review under this policy.

Misrepresentation of One’s Credentials or Status, or Failure to Correct Others’ Inaccuracies or Misrepresentation of One’s Credentials: This includes professional experience, paid or unpaid, including positions held; and relevant timeframes and dates (e.g., the timeframe in which a professional position was held, or the date on which a degree was earned).

Unethical Consulting Activity, Including Misrepresentation of One’s Status, Credentials, or Level of Expertise to Secure a Consulting Assignment; and Knowingly Taking on a Consulting Assignment Without the Necessary Knowledge or Expertise: Consultation should only be provided by individuals who have demonstrated knowledge, expertise, and competence related to the consultation. To avoid problems in this regard, students are strongly encouraged to seek the advice of their faculty advisors or other appropriate members of the faculty before taking on a consulting assignment.

Unethical Professional Practice Based on Conflict of Interest: This includes engaging in unethical professional behaviors to promote, benefit or protect one’s self, family, friends, or business colleagues; and exploiting personal knowledge about an individual (e.g., personal life as well as political and religious views).

Deliberate Failure to Protect Confidential Records, in Accordance with Relevant Professional Standards

Abuse of the Peer Review Process: This includes the following:

- Simultaneous submission of a manuscript to more than one journal without approval from the respective editors
- Submission of previously published material without clarifying the extent of the previously published material to the editor
- Submitting a manuscript without the permission/agreement of all authors
- Judging a peer’s work on other than professional grounds
- Judging a peer’s work unfairly or in an uninformed way
- Serving as a peer reviewer despite conflict of interest (e.g., having a personal relationship with the author) or otherwise being knowingly unable to judge the merits of scholarly work without prejudice
- Trying to unduly influence a colleague’s review of one’s own work

Other Fraudulent Behavior: This includes actions, taken individually or with other people that the Associate Dean for Academic Programs believes to call into question the student’s ability to ethically and competently join the profession. Specific examples include knowingly providing false information in one’s professional role, embezzling funds, and misusing school resources.

Aiding or Abetting Professional Misconduct: Aiding or abetting any individual in the violation of any of the categories of professional misconduct outlined above shall itself be considered misconduct.

Attempted professional misconduct: An attempt to commit professional misconduct may be treated as seriously as the completed act.

Other violations of State or Federal laws or University policies, brought to the attention of the School of Information that are not explicitly mentioned in the policies and standards of conduct mentioned above but which appear to merit review under this policy, will be evaluated on a case by case basis.

# Academic Dispute Resolution

At the School of Information (UMSI), we are committed to fostering a reflective community working to actively embed equity, accessibility, and inclusion into our policies and daily practices.

[UMSI’s Academic Dispute Resolution Policy and Procedures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tv2u0-QOgrDzDlHZsXvBOJuMI-eTk2CunDxIHb66kdw/edit#) are available to students who have a dispute regarding final grades where UMSI is the home unit (UMSI-owned courses); academic policies of UMSI; and sanction, suspension, or dismissal decisions for UMSI students.

If a student has an academic dispute or disagreement with faculty or staff about the equity and fairness of decisions, policies, or procedures that affect their academic standing and progress towards their degree, or feels they have been assigned unfair sanctions, they can have an initial conversation with an academic advisor about their circumstances. Students should consult an academic advisor to decide which avenue is best, and about counseling and university resources that may be appropriate. Please see additional policy, guidance and processes below.

If the basis of a student’s academic dispute is that the student was subjected to harassment or discrimination, the student can be referred to the appropriate resources in collaboration with the UMSI DEI Office. While it is not the function of the Dispute Resolution process to evaluate claims of discrimination or harassment, we encourage you to speak with someone and file a report of your concerns with the university. If you are a witness to or experience conduct that discriminates, stereotypes, excludes, harasses or harms you or any person in our community based on an identity (race, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, work status, or religion), there are multiple options for sharing or reporting concerns. For information on university reporting options, visit the [University’s Expect Respect website](https://expectrespect.umich.edu/topic/report-campus-climate-concern).

Reporting incidents to the university is important — and you can also contact the UMSI DEI Office to discuss the incident, situation or concern and determine ways UMSI can be supportive and responsive. For information on talking to someone at UMSI, visit the [UMSI DEI Office Reporting and Feedback webpage](https://www.si.umich.edu/about-umsi/diversity-equity-inclusion-office/dei-reporting-and-feedback).

If the dispute involves multiple offices, please inform the UMSI Office of Academic and Student Affairs. The timeline of the academic dispute will pause until other matters are resolved.

Additionally resources, as well as the Academic Dispute Resolution Process and Formal Student Appeals Process can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tv2u0-QOgrDzDlHZsXvBOJuMI-eTk2CunDxIHb66kdw/edit#).

# Petitions

The UM ​​School​ of Information (UMSI) ​policies​ ​appear ​​in ​​the ​​student ​​handbooks ​​available ​​on each program's Advising Canvas page. ​​All​​ School policies ​​have ​​been ​​formulated ​​with ​​one ​​objective:​​ the ​​pursuit ​​of ​​academic​ ​quality.​​ This ​​goal requires​​ that​​ the ​​policies ​​be ​​equitably ​​and ​​uniformly ​​applied​ ​to ​​everyone.​ ​However, the School of Information does recognize the infrequent occurrence of extenuating circumstances that warrant individual consideration. School of Information students may petition the school for a modification or waiver of any UMSI policy by submitting the [UMSI Petition Form](https://forms.gle/iZ35r3xnhpbwXsU36). ​​In completing the form, state in writing all facts that have a bearing on the case you wish to present. If the petition involves a course, it must also be endorsed by the instructor. ​Please note that a reduction in time to degree, a reduction in tuition, or a reduction in final term enrollment, are not extenuating circumstances for a modification or waiver of policy. If you’d like to submit a UMSI Petition Form, please contact your advising team first for a conversation about your petition request.

# Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Policy

The School of Information’s commitment to diversity and inclusiveness extends to students with disabilities. UMSI is committed to the academic success, professional development and general well-being of all students.

Students with disabilities who require reasonable accommodations from UMSI to assist them in meeting the requirements of their degree program are strongly encouraged to register with the [U-M Services for Students with Disabilities office (SSD)](https://ssd.umich.edu/) and also meet with an academic advisor in the UMSI Office of Academic and Student Affairs. UMSI, through its faculty, staff, and administrators, may require a student to register with SSD to confirm reasonable accommodations and reserves the right to determine if the accommodations recommended by SSD are reasonable. Reasonable accommodations are those that 1) do not fundamentally alter the academic program, academic standards, or professional standards of UMSI; and 2) do not cause an undue burden on UMSI. Only reasonable accommodations first approved by SSD and/or agreed to by a faculty instructor, staff member, or administrator will be provided. UMSI does not provide retroactive accommodations.

Information regarding SSD, the services available to students with disabilities, and the rights and responsibilities of students with disabilities is available on the [Services for Students with Disabilities](https://ssd.umich.edu/) website. If you have questions about obtaining authorized accommodations, please contact the MADS Academic Advising Team at [umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu).

If you have a concern regarding disability accommodations in terms of fairness and equity, contact the Associate Director of Academic Programs and/or refer to the dispute resolution policy sections of this handbook.

Steps to secure a reasonable accommodation:

1. Complete the Student Application Form in [Accommodate](https://umich-accommodate.symplicity.com/) and meet with your assigned coordinator in the Services for Students with Disabilities office (SSD). Alternatively, provide documentation of your disability to your faculty instructor and to your academic advisor in the Office of Academic and Student Affairs to determine a reasonable accommodation. Note that UMSI reserves the right to require that you register with SSD and obtain approved accommodations.
2. You must seek reasonable accommodations for each course for which an accommodation is needed, and you should communicate with the faculty member and with an academic advisor in the Office of Academic and Student Affairs in advance of the start of the term or as soon as possible thereafter. Requests for accommodations for exams, quizzes, or any other assignments or projects must be presented to the instructor at least two weeks before the due date.
3. For any other event or services offered by UMSI for which you need accommodations, submit your request to the appropriate staff member at least two weeks in advance or at the time you register or RSVP if applicable.
4. Because the decision to request reasonable accommodations due to a disability is a matter of individual choice, students have the responsibility to request reasonable accommodations in a timely manner. As a result, we do not assume that an accommodation provided in one course is appropriate or desired in another situation. Similarly, UMSI treats such requests in as confidential a manner as possible. Therefore, do not assume that because one faculty or staff member is aware of your need for an accommodation that others are also aware. You should request a reasonable accommodation each time you determine that one is needed.
5. If you are working with fellow students in group projects or research, it is your choice to disclose your disability and/or to describe needs you may have for completing work as a team. Every student will have their own strengths and challenges, but if you have a disability that may impact your ability to work effectively on a team, discussing this up front and coming up with creative strategies can be important to your success and the success of the group.

# UMSI Student Parental Accommodation Policy

The Student Parental Accommodation Policy assists graduate students immediately following the birth or adoption of a young child. The purpose of this policy is to make it possible for a student to maintain registered full time student status, along with all the benefits of such status, while facilitating the return to full participation in courses, research and teaching.

The policy applies to full time, enrolled students who are in good academic standing, and making satisfactory progress toward completion of their degree. Students must have completed at least one full time semester of their degree program to become eligible for coverage under this policy. The policy covers the situation of students who experience childbirth or the adoption of a child under the age of 6 for whom the student has parental responsibilities. These eligibility requirements cover all three provisions of the policy.

The three primary accommodations available are:

1. Eligible students are entitled to an extension of one year per childbirth or adoption to the 5-year maximum time to degree policy. UMSI must approve requests for extension of time limits.
2. All eligible students will be granted a Parental Accommodation period up to six weeks long immediately following the birth of a child or the adoption of a child under the age of 6 for whom the student has parental responsibilities. During this period of accommodation, the student will continue to be enrolled as a full time student. Because the student remains enrolled as a full time student and continues to pay tuition, this is not a leave of absence. It is instead a modification of deadlines and academic expectations to accommodate the student’s new parental responsibilities. Students are expected to work with faculty and staff in advance of their leave to develop a workable plan.
3. Students in GSRA positions are eligible to continue in their positions with funding and to have modified schedules and the stated 6 weeks leave time upon birth of a child or adoption of a child. The terms of employment for students with GSI or GSSA appointments are covered by the contract between the University and the Graduate Employees Organization. The provisions of the contract will govern stipend and benefits for these students. Students receiving fellowship or scholarship funds will remain enrolled and as such these funds will not be impacted.

# Funding

## Conference Presentation Travel Grant

# MADS Slack Policy, Standards, and Practices

## MADS Slack Policy

[MADS Slack Policy, Standards, and Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgxAYs2ZxNew4q9vSHCOGLNk6ZkFV8ueLCkXic5wPQo/edit#heading=h.lbr4s95fau6e)

As an official tool used by the entire MADS community:

1. Students recognize that the Slack Workspace (UMich MADS) is _exclusively_ for MADS students and alumni and MADS program affiliates (i.e., faculty and staff).
2. All users of the MADS workspace will join using their U-M (@umich.edu) email addresses. Non-@umich.edu email addresses will be expunged from the workspace.
3. All communications, regardless if they are in a direct message (DM), private channel, or public channel, are subject to this policy.
4. This policy is inclusive of the University of Michigan’s Responsible Use of Information Resources: [https://spg.umich.edu/policy/601.07](https://spg.umich.edu/policy/601.07). Violations may result in muting (i.e., you may not post to the channel but may still read others' posts) and/or revocation of Slack privileges.
5. In instances where Slack administrators (i.e., MADS staff) discover that there are one or more items in a channel where they do not belong, they reserve the right to remove them from the channel(s).
6. Faculty moderate their course channel(s). They reserve the right to remove content from their course channels deemed inappropriate or irrelevant to the purpose of their channel(s).
7. Faculty may mute members from posting excessive, disruptive, or unprofessional content. Faculty will warn individual students at least once before muting for one week. Repeated violations may result in expulsion from the channel.
8. The same muting policy applies to non-course channels in instances where there are violations of this Slack policy and after a warning has been issued.
9. Direct messages (DMs) between two or more people are only allowed to be screenshot and shared in private or public channels with the explicit permission of every person in the DM. Violations will result in the removal of the screenshots from the private or public channel(s).
10. UMSI will employ automated tools to add users to the official program Slack channels, create/archive channels, remove non-UM accounts, and perform other logistical activities.
11. Users understand that UMSI/U-M faculty and staff and Coursera staff have access to the workspace, and certain members have administrative access to any/all channels contained within it.
12. Students will use the material in Onboarding and Orientation and Slack Help to understand how to use the tool. MADS team members and other MADS students may also be able to answer questions about Slack on a case-by-case basis.

## MADS Slack Standards and Processes

### Slack Workspace and Course Channel Participation

- Students will be automatically added to course channels based on official course rosters provided by the University of Michigan.
- UMSI automated processes ensure students are added to course channels regularly and frequently.
  - If you cannot access a course channel or would like to be removed from a course channel due to a course add/drop, **please wait for the automated process to complete**.
  - Slack additions and removals are based on official course rosters pulled directly from Wolverine Access. If you've waited for **24 hours** and are not in the channel where you belong or are in a channel where you don’t belong, please email [umsimadshelp@umich.edu](mailto:umsimadshelp@umich.edu) for assistance.
- MADS alumni will retain, in some capacity, their access to the Slack workspace.
  - MADS students who leave the program will lose their workspace access after one week from the time their program withdrawal is processed.
  - MADS students taking a leave of absence will remain in the workspace if they indicate that they plan to return to the MADS program. The same withdrawal policy applies when those plans change, and the absence turns into a withdrawal.

### User-Created Channels

- Students may create both private and public channels.
  - Note that the naming prefix \_siads\* \_is considered reserved and should not be used for student-created channels. Channels that conflict with this naming convention will be removed.
- Slack administrators (i.e., MADS staff) will occasionally audit user-created channels.
  - Channels that will be removed from the workspace include those:
    - With only one member
    - That have been inactive for 12 or more months
    - That are redundant to other channels
    - That are inappropriate for a professional workspace

### Leaving Course Channels

- While a course is active, students listed in the official class roster will be re-added to the course channel per the automatic process above if they leave the channel. Students should [mute notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages) if they do not want to engage in the channel.
- Students may leave course channels after the course has ended to clean up their channel list.
- Course channels remain open for three months after the course has ended. After three months, the channel is automatically archived.

### Archiving Channels

- Users who were enrolled in a course will have ongoing access to the associated course channel content via [search](https://slack.com/help/articles/202528808-Search-in-Slack) after it is archived. However, the channel will no longer be listed in the **All channels** section of the workspace.
  - Before archiving, all students who were enrolled in the course based on the final official roster will be re-added to the course channel. (This ensures that everyone has search access to the channel after it is archived).
- Archived channels are searchable but not modifiable (e.g., content cannot be added or deleted).

### Use of Slack

The UMich MADS Slack workspace is an official communication, question and answer, and community space. We recognize that MADS students, faculty, and staff may use Slack in a variety of ways. Each community member is responsible for their communication and behavior while using Slack. As a sanctioned tool of our program, which all MADS students use, we expect the following:

- **Communication in Slack remains professional**. While there are various ways to define “professional,” we expect that members of our community will respectfully engage one another. The professional and personal relationships you make here may last well beyond your participation in the MADS program.
- **UMSI faculty and staff will generally share how they prefer to use Slack**. If a UMSI faculty or staff prefers not to respond to DMs, they will let students know. Students, in turn, should not expect UMSI faculty and staff to respond to DMs or mentions (@) if they have indicated they do not use Slack in this way.
- **Group DMs will be utilized if instructional teams require it**. Please remember to DM an entire instructional team if they’ve asked students to engage with them this way. If a student DMs a single instructional team member, that member may add other team members to the conversation.
- **Private conversations (in DMs) should remain private**. If DMs are shared in public channels, Slack administrators may remove them.
- **Code will not be shared in Slack unless done privately or allowed by the instructor(s)**. Assignment code that is shared publicly without permission may be removed by Slack administrators.
- **Channel conversations should remain focused on the channel’s purpose/topic**. For example:
  - The #official-announcements channel is for organization-wide announcements. You will find communications from the MADS program staff or MADSA members (our student organization) and other official business in this read-only channel.
  - The #random channel is for anyone to post things relevant to our community. These may include data science humor, questions, or articles of interest.
  - The #peer-to-peer-advice channel is for our MADS students to seek advice and ask/answer questions of other students about the MADS program and courses.
- **Community members should report concerns about Slack to [umsimadshelp@umich.edu](mailto:umsimadshelp@umich.edu)**. These concerns will be addressed by Slack administrators (MADS staff) and our Academic Program Director.

### Use of Slack Apps and Bots

All members of the UMich MADS Slack Workspace may submit requests to the Slack administrators to install app(s) in our workspace. However, **the program is not obligated to install any app in our workspace**. At least one MADS faculty and one Slack administrator (MADS staff) will review each app request and approve or deny apps on a case-by-case basis. Please keep in mind:

- We will evaluate the utility value of an app for our workspace, including how widely used we anticipate it will be, how much or little it makes using Slack easier, and/or the teaching and learning objectives it may help meet for an academic workspace like ours.
- We will look at other apps Slack has published in their App Directory as a guide for whether or not to approve it for our workspace.
- We will not approve apps intended for use by a single user. Once approved, an app is available to every workspace member.
- We will not approve apps that are still in development. An app should be ready and usable by every workspace member.

Some faculty members have created and installed apps in our workspace for teaching and learning purposes. These apps may include tracking, for example, the frequency of posts made in a private course channel. These apps are strictly for faculty and program staff who employ them to meet specific course or program objectives.

We consider apps that specifically post messages or respond to messages from human users as bots. They are generally considered disruptive, and their use is strongly discouraged. Currently, the only approved bot is the course automation bot (MADS Tech Robot). Occasionally a MADS team member may also use an auto-response bot to inform community members about their availability.

## MADS Slack Practices

Slack is an effective tool for online engagement and collaboration. It is one of the main tools our community uses to come together and learn from each other. Our community is global, and our Slack workspace represents this. We make up different cultures, time zones, and backgrounds but have a shared commitment to the study of data science. Our Slack workspace is an inclusive and professional space for members of our community. When using Slack, please remember these practices. **Failure to uphold them may result in the loss of posting privileges or workspace access**.

- **When you start using Slack**

  We recommend using the Slack desktop and mobile apps rather than the web browser. When you set up your Slack profile, we welcome you to include your name, pronouns, time zone, and expected graduation date (month/year). You may also include your job title if employed.

- **Mind the channel's _purpose_ and not just your interests**

  Each Slack channel is designed for a specific purpose, such as project discussion or career development. If you are interested in sharing something, find the right channel to do so. It makes retrieving information from Slack easier, too. Only post to a community-wide channel if you are making an announcement or asking a question relevant to our entire MADS community. If you discover you have an interest not represented in a current channel, you are welcome to create a new one, but before you do, browse the channels first to see if it already exists.

- **Use direct messaging or email when sharing feedback**

  Use direct messages (DMs) or email ([umsimadshelp@umich.edu](mailto:umsimadshelp@umich.edu)) when you want to share crucial individual, course, or program feedback or offer constructive but personal or individual feedback to instructors, staff, or other students. Given the volume of conversations and the various ways community members use Slack (i.e., some are heavy users and others are not), this feedback may be overlooked or not responded to if posted in a channel.

- **Use direct messaging when sharing assignment code with an instructor(s). Use course channels when asking assignment questions**

  You may want to ask an instructor for specific feedback about your assignment code or writing. If you are communicating with an instructor and they ask to see your work, please direct message it to them so others don’t see it. If you have general assignment questions, start with the applicable private course channel before DMing the instructional team. Your peers may be able to answer your questions. If the instructor allows sharing work in a course channel, you may defer to their guidance but otherwise refrain from sharing solutions publicly.

- **Use [labels] and follow pinned threads to help organize a course channel**

  If you are asking a question about an assignment or other course topic, begin your message with a label wrapped in square brackets to signal what the assignment or question is about. Be sure to post your question in the appropriate homework pinned thread (typically set up by the instructional team on the first day of the course). For example, if you had a question about how to approach the first assignment, you would start the message with [Assignment 1], or if you had a query about question two from the third homework, you would start the message with [HW3 Q2].

  How you refer to the homework depends on what it is called in the course and how others refer to it. By using labels at the beginning of messages, instructors and fellow students can more quickly understand your question and, in the case of fellow students, see if they can help or benefit from that question thread. Additionally, the labels can be used to search the channel more easily.

- **Announce when you’re leaving a discussion if it’s happening in real time.**

  When you are in the middle of a discussion in a channel or DM, let everyone know when you decide to leave the discussion if it’s happening in real time.

- **Switch to email when you have large attachments**

  Slack is not great at handling a lot of attachments in one place. Whenever you have large attachments you're sharing with others, you can send an email or use Google Drive instead of posting it to Slack.

- **@channel is reserved for announcements**

  @channel is generally reserved for announcements from program faculty and staff. Please don't use @channel. If you'd like to alert everyone who is active for an @here announcement, you may do so. However, be mindful when using @here, as we have many time zones represented in our program.

- **Don't pin and unpin messages**

  Typically, MADS faculty and staff have pinned a message to a channel so others can easily access or reference it. Unpinning an item makes it much harder to search for. Please reserve pinning and unpinning for MADS faculty and staff.

- **Tailor your writing style**

  Think of Slack as a conversation instead of a presentation. Don’t feel like you have to write everything in one go.Communicating in one sentence at a time will keep the conversation going. It will help others process the information in real time. However, if you have multiple things to say, threading the rest of your messages under the first one helps keep things organized and prevents pinging everyone in the channel multiple times.

- **Acknowledge, even when you want to work on it later**

  You may get a question or request from your classmates on Slack when you’re busy with other things. Instead of leaving the message unattended, tell them you have seen it and will get around to acting on it later.

- **Send a direct message before adding someone to a new channel**

  The message should help them clearly understand what to discuss in that particular channel.

- **Set your Slack status and availability**

  Ensure you [set your Slack status](https://slack.com/help/articles/201864558-Set-your-Slack-status-and-availability), which shows a custom message and emoji, such as “in a meeting” or “on a flight,” to indicate what you are up to.

- **Make sure your notifications are set at the "right" level for you**

  This way, you won’t miss any critical discussion but also won't be bothered by frequent pings on topics less relevant or you care less about. If interested, U-M Information and Technology Services provides an overview of [Slack notification best practices](https://documentation.its.umich.edu/slack-notifications) to help you manage when and how you’re notified.

- **Mark conversations for later**

  Every time you discuss something that you feel might be useful to reference later, [mark the conversation using the bookmark icon](https://slack.com/help/articles/360042650274-Save-messages-and-files-for-later) (“Save for later”). These conversations will be saved to your “Later” section at the top of your sidebar.
