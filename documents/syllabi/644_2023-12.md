## Course Schedule

- This course begins on November 21, 2023, and ends on December 18, 2023.
- Weekly assignments will be **due on Mondays at 11:59 pm** (Ann Arbor, Michigan time; U.S. Eastern time zone).

Week 1 focuses on the mathematical foundation of reinforcement learning. Students will learn dynamic programming and the principle of optimality. Students will focus on the Bellman equations for different types of reinforcement learning problems.

Week 2 focuses on the algorithmic foundation. Students will learn value iteration and policy iteration algorithms. After that, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning and SARSA will be introduced. Students will also learn linear function approximation for complex reinforcement learning problems. Students will be asked to use linear function approximation to play simple Tetris.

Week 3 focuses on deep learning algorithms such as Q-learning, actor-critic algorithms, and deep policy gradient algorithms. Students will be asked to train a BipedalWalker in OpenAI Gym.

Week 4 focuses on the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and the ideas behind Alpha-zero. Students will learn upper-confidence bound and Monte Carlo Tree Search. Students will be asked to program a simple Alpha-zero based on self-play.

## Weekly Office Hours Via Zoom (Ann Arbor, Michigan Time):

Your instructor will hold weekly, synchronous office hours using the video-conferencing tool, Zoom. The schedule of office hours can be found by clicking on the **Live Events** link in the lefthand navigation menu. Additionally, all office hours will be recorded and archived so that you can retrieve them at a later date. Office hour recordings will be available in the course. Password for all office hours will be 644 and take place in EST time.
