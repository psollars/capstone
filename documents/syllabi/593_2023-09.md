Note: All assignments are required to earn credit for this course.

## 8.0 Late Policy

Late assignments will be penalized 25% of the total points to be earned each day a submission is overdue. An assignment that is submitted four (4) calendar days after the due date will receive a score of zero (0). Please note: Submitting your work on time is very important in this course. Your peers are relying on you to submit your work on time in this course so they can complete their work (in the form of peer reviews). The instructional team will periodically reach out to you and ask you about your progress; if you fall behind on your project work you will be overwhelmed and you will be at risk for not succeeding in the course.

## 9.0 Course Grades

## 10.0 Academic Integrity/Code Of Conduct

## 10.1 Collaboration

UMSI strongly encourages collaboration while working on some assignments, such as homework problems and interpreting reading assignments as a general practice. Active learning is effective. Collaboration with other students in the course will be especially valuable in summarizing the reading materials and picking out the key concepts. You must, however, write your homework submission on your own, in your own words, before turning it in. If you worked with someone on the homework before writing it, you must list any and all collaborators on your written submission. Each course and each instructor may place restrictions on collaboration for any or all assignments. Read the instructions carefully and request clarification about collaboration when in doubt. Collaboration is almost always forbidden for take-home and in class exams.

If you are a more advanced student and are willing to help other students, please feel free to do so. Just remember that your goal is to help teach the material to the student receiving the help and not do their work for them.

## 10.2 Plagiarism

All written submissions must be your own, original work. Original work for narrative questions is not mere paraphrasing of someone else's completed answer: you must not share written answers with each other at all. At most, you should be working from notes you took while participating in a study session. Largely duplicate copies of the same assignment will receive an equal division of the total point score from the one piece of work. You may incorporate selected excerpts, statements or phrases from publications by other authors, but they must be clearly marked as quotations and must be attributed. If you build on the ideas of prior authors, you must cite their work. You may obtain copy editing assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others, but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own, or be explicitly attributed to another. See the (Doctoral, MSI, BSI) student handbooks available on the UMSI intranet for the definition of plagiarism, resources to help you avoid it, and the consequences for intentional or unintentional plagiarism.

## 10.3 Generative Artificial Intelligence

Emerging generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools provide news ways to learn and master computational thinking and creative programming. Using generative AI to complete SIADS 593 assignments is permitted, unless expressly prohibited by the assignment instructions. If you utilize generative AI to generate assignment code you _must_ cite the tool(s), prompts, and outputs employed to complete the assignment. If you fail to disclose your use of generative AI you will receive a score of zero (0) for the assignment. Repeated use without disclosure will be reported to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.

Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, UM-GPT, and Github Copilot can increase productivity and accelerate software development. But downsides exist and you _must_ exercise caution when leveraging AI in your work. AI tools are imperfect and can produce content that is inappropriate, offensive, or otherwise problematic. AI tools can produce code that is inelegant, inefficient, insecure, unreliable, unreadable, and/or unmaintainable. Within a classroom context, AI tools can produce code that performs the desired computation but nevertheless fails to meet the requirements of an assignment problem. You are responsible for the code you submit. If you are unfamiliar with the syntax, structure, and/or semantics of AI-generated code _do not_ include the code in your assignment solution. If you cannot explain to your instructor the computations that AI-generated code performs _do not_ include the code in your assignment solution. You do yourself no favors by submitting code that you do not understand. In the end, however, you need to decide on the degree to which you use generative AI. Do you want to be the sort of data scientist who merely repeats what others have done, or do you want to be one who contributes to the future work of other data scientists? This is not a black-and-white distinction and we encourage you to use generative AI when appropriate, but consider lessening your reliance on the technology as you gain experience with data science tools.

## 16.0 Disability Statement

The University of Michigan recognizes disability as an integral part of diversity and is committed to creating an inclusive and equitable educational environment for students with disabilities. Students who are experiencing a disability-related barrier should contact Services for Students with Disabilities; 734-763-3000 or ssdoffice@umich.edu). For students who are connected with SSD, accommodation requests can be made in Accommodate. If you have any questions or concerns please contact your SSD Coordinator or visit SSD's Current Student webpage. SSD considers aspects of the course design, course learning objects and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SSD, instructors, and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience. The instructional team will treat any information that you provide in as confidential a manner as possible.

## 17.0 Religious Holidays

Although the University of Michigan, as an institution, does not observe religious holidays, it has long been the University's policy that every reasonable effort should be made to help students avoid negative academic consequences when their religious obligations conflict with academic requirements. Absence from classes or examinations for religious reasons does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence. Students who expect to miss classes, examinations, or other assignments as a consequence of their religious observance shall be provided with a reasonable alternative opportunity to complete such academic responsibilities. It is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious holidays on which they will be absent. Such notice must be given by the drop/add deadline of the given term. Students who are absent on days of examinations or class assignments shall be offered an opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, unless it can be demonstrated that a make-up opportunity would interfere unreasonably with the delivery of the course. Should disagreement arise over any aspect of this policy, the parties involved should contact the Department Chair, the Dean of the School, or the Ombudsperson. Final appeals will be resolved by the Provost. The Office of the Provost maintains a list of religious holidays that may pose a conflict with the academic calendar.

## 18.0 Technology Tips

We will be using Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, and Google Sheets to facilitate communication. The comprehensive oral exam will be conducted using Zoom, and the team project will be Python-based and Jupyter notebook-based. This course differs from your other MADS courses in many ways including technology. We have created a Jupyter environment for you that is functionally equivalent to SIADS 516, which is a superset of the base MADS environment.

You can access that environment via the "ungraded lab assignment" in Coursera. You can use that environment or choose to use any of the environments from courses you have already completed. Alternatively, you can use your own locally installed environment. Another possibility is to use Deepnote or Google Collaboratory which may facilitate collaboration.
