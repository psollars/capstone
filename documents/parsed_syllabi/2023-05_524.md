# Course Syllabus - SIADS 524: Presenting Uncertainty

## **How to Get Help**

If you have questions concerning the degree program, encounter a technical issue with Coursera, or issues using Slack, please submit a report to the ticketing system at umsimadshelp@umich.edu.

If you have an issue specific to the Coursera environment, you can also begin a [live chat session](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/360024928831-Chat-with-us) with Coursera Technical Support (24/7) or view [Coursera troubleshooting guides](https://learner.coursera.help/) . (You may be asked to log in to your Coursera account).

For questions regarding course content, refer to the **Communications Expectations** section below.

## **Course Overview and Prerequisites**

This course covers strategies and techniques for effective uncertainty visualization. Uncertainty communication is essential for data analysts to learn, both to better understand their data and to effectively communicate the implications of data and models to others. This class covers a wide variety of uncertainty visualization techniques, including continuous uncertainty encodings, intervals, and frequency-framing approaches. Students will learn how each technique impacts people’s ability to perceive and reason about uncertainty and what biases and pitfalls to be wary of when communicating uncertainty. Uncertainty visualization techniques are placed into a coherent theoretical foundation, the Grammar of Graphics, and programming exercises are conducted in a Grammar of Graphics-based API, Altair. Finally, as it is crucial to accurately represent the limits of our knowledge, strategies for dealing with large-world uncertainty (communicating uncertainty about model specifications themselves) will be discussed throughout.

**Advisory Prerequisite** : Visual Exploration of Data

**Enforced Prerequisites:** Math Methods for Data Science, Information Visualization I

Students should have seen different types of data plots (e.g., histograms, box plots) before entering the course (covered by the stats prerequisites), but they don’t need to be able to generate them through programming. Students should have an understanding of probability and Bayes’ rule (covered in Math Methods) and the Altair visualization library (covered in Infovis I).

## **Instructor and Course Assistants**

Instructor: Nick Sheltrown - [sheltro@umich.edu](mailto:sheltro@umich.edu)

Course Lecturers: Deepti Pandey - [deeptip@umich.edu](mailto: deeptip@umich.edu "Deepti Email") ; Jake Huang - [yiju@umich.edu](mailto:yiju@umich.edu "Jake email")

- **Contacting your instructor and course assistant(s):** Use the course channel in Slack **(siads524_ss23_001); for private messages the preferred method is to direct message us on Slack** . You can also email us (see above), but this is not preferred: Slack response time will be better than email.
- **Slack response time:** Slack is the preferred communication medium **for any questions and conversations that the group would benefit from,** such as questions relating to course structure, and assignment clarifications. Posts received by 5pm Eastern will receive a same-day response; posts after 5pm Eastern will receive a response within 24 hours. As has been done in other MADS classes, we are going to set up separate threads for each week under which you can post your questions. Please tag both instructors in your question so that we won't miss any questions posted. If you’d like to ask a private question, please send a direct message to both of us, instead of to an individual instructor, so that your questions can be answered more quickly. This also helps keep the instructional staff on the same page as we work through issues, because we see each other's answers.
- **Email response time:** 48 hours; use only if you have been unable to reach us in Slack.
- **Communicate proactively.** If you find yourself in the position that you are not going to have an assignment ready for a deadline, please reach out ahead of time to discuss your options.

## **Required Readings**

You will be given a list of required and recommended readings within the course. Online access to these readings are provided through the University of Michigan Library or through approved online sources. For resources provided through the library, you will be asked to sign in with your UMich uniqname and password to access these materials.

## **Technology Requirements**

All course activities can be completed using core MADS technology, primarily Jupyter Notebooks within the Coursera platform. Accessibility For those who choose to use Jupyter Notebooks, please see the [screen reader configuration for Jupyter Notebook Content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ct4BShNTYVU2J_oYeuTTsODSAFlEhtODXMlfc4-t5PM/edit?usp=sharing) . For other accommodations needed related to COVID-19, please reach out to the instructors in Slack.

- Read uncertainty visualizations
- Select appropriate uncertainty visualization encodings given the type of uncertainty and a decision-making task

## **Student Mental Health**

University Students may experience stressors that can impact both their academic experience and their personal well-being. These may include academic pressures and challenges associated with relationships, mental health, alcohol or other drugs, identities, finances, etc. If you are experiencing concerns, seeking help is a courageous thing to do for yourself and those who care about you. If the source of your stressors is academic, please contact me so that we can find solutions together. Ashley Evearitt, a Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) counselor, is embedded in UMSI, schedule an appointment with her by copying and pasting the following url into your browser: https://bit.ly/Evearitt-CAPS-UMSIFor personal concerns, U-M offers a variety of resources, many which are listed on the Resources for Student Well-being webpage. You can also search for additional well-being resources on that website.

## **Disability Statement**

The University of Michigan recognizes disability as an integral part of diversity and is committed to creating an inclusive and equitable educational environment for students with disabilities. Students who are experiencing a disability-related barrier should contact Services for Students with Disabilities https://ssd.umich.edu/; 734-763-3000 or ssdoffice@umich.edu). For students who are connected with SSD, accommodation requests can be made in Accommodate. If you have any questions or concerns please contact your SSD Coordinator or visit SSD’s Current Student webpage. SSD considers aspects of the course design, course learning objects and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SSD, instructors, and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience. The instructional team will treat any information that you provide in as confidential a manner as possible.

## **Audio and Video Recording**

Class RecordingsWe will be doing audio and video recording of all office hour sessions to enable those who cannot attend office hours in person on a given day to access the content. These recordings will not be made available publicly. Recordings of all sessions will be available on Coursera only to students registered for this class. As part of your participation in office hours, you may be recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please contact the professor during the first week of class to discuss alternative arrangements. Students may not copy and share the office hour videos with those not in the class, or upload them to any other online environment (this is a violation of the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)).Personal recordings are prohibited except with permissionStudents are prohibited from recording/distributing any class activity without written permission from the instructor, except as necessary as part of approved accommodations for students with disabilities. Any approved recordings may only be used for the student’s own private use.
