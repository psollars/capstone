# Course Syllabus - SIADS 532

### **Course Overview and Prerequisites**

This course will introduce basic concepts and tasks of data mining. It focuses on how to formally represent real-world information as basic data types (itemsets, matrices, and sequences) that facilitate downstream analytics tasks. Students will learn how to characterize each type of data through pattern extraction and similarity measures.

Course prerequisites: Mathematics Methods for Applied Data Science, Data Manipulation
