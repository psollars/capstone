## **Course Overview and Prerequisites**

This course introduces experiment design for laboratory and field experiments. We will discuss the logic of experimentation, and the ways in which experimentation has been -- and could be -- used to investigate social and technological phenomena. Students will learn how to design experiments and analyze experimental data.Students should have completed at least one undergraduate statistics class at the level of Stats 250.

## **Learning Outcomes**

1. Use experiment as a method for causal inference.
2. When designing experiments, know when to use blocking versus clustering for random assignment and subsequent data analysis.
3. When designing an experiment, know basis power calculation.
4. When implementing an experiment, know how to handle spillovers and non-compliance; know how to correct for multiple testing.
5. Develop awareness of the areas of applications for laboratory and field experiments  -- experiments as measurement of individual preferences, as policy interventions, as evaluation method.

For this course, the late-submission penalty is a 15% daily-recurring reduction in grade for the first three days after the submission deadline. You will receive a zero (0) if your assignment is turned in four or more days late.  Students have one free pass to submit all of one week’s assessments late (up to three days).  Students don't need to explain their circumstances but need to report their late submission by DMing Instructional team. Instructional team will adjust the late grade for one week’s assessments.

### **Academic Integrity / Code of Conduct**

While we offer a number of discussion channels to support your work, if you are stuck **you may not share or receive complete solutions to the assignments.** We also encourage you to support your classmates, but again, without sharing completed code (pointing to resources, describing ideas in pseudo-code, etc. is fine).

### **Accommodations**
