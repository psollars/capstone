## Course Overview

Students will learn how to correctly apply, interpret results, and iteratively refine and tune supervised machine learning models to solve a diverse set of problems on real-world datasets. Application is emphasized over theoretical content. The supervised learning course is an essential part of the core MADS machine learning series: its concepts, algorithms, and evaluation methods are used heavily throughout the following machine learning courses that include: unsupervised learning, deep learning, and machine learning pipelines.

Note : This course is based on material that also appears in the Supervised Machine Learning course in the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization on Coursera. A number of the weekly assessments are different in the MADS version, but some overlap may remain in a few cases. If you've already taken the Specialization version of this course, please contact the instructor if you would like the option of doing an alternate assignment for a given week. This course also contains significant content on additional topics not available in the Specialization.

## Prerequisites

In order to be successful in this course, you must know how to program in Python and be familiar with the numpy and pandas Python libraries for data manipulation, and matplotlib for plotting.

## Schedule

Week 1 : You'll be introduced to basic machine learning concepts, tasks, and workflow using an example classification problem based on the K-nearest neighbors method, and implemented using the SciKit-Learn library. This week's assignment has a refresher on data manipulation with numpy in part 1. Then in part 2, you work through the process of loading and examining a dataset, training a k-nearest neighbors classifier on the dataset, and then evaluating the accuracy of the classifier and using it to classify new data. Readings (Intro to ML with Python): All of Chapter 1 Section 2.1: Classification and Regression (short!) Section 2.2: Over and Underfitting Section 2.3: Introduction (short!) Section 2.3.1: Sample datasets Section 4.-4.2: Dummy variables and One-Hot Encoding Week 2 : We will delve into a wider variety of supervised learning methods for both classification and regression, learning about the connection between model complexity and generalization performance, the importance of proper feature scaling, and how to control model complexity by applying techniques like regularization to avoid overfitting. In addition to k-nearest neighbors, this week covers linear regression (least-squares, ridge, lasso, and polynomial regression), logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and the use of cross-validation for model evaluation. Readings: Section 2.3.2: K-Nearest Neighbors Classification and Regression Section 2.3.3: Linear models (Warning - long section!). This covers flavors of linear and logistic regression, and linear SVMs. Section 2.3.7: Kernelized Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Section 3.3: Preprocessing and Scaling Section 4.5: Interactions and Polynomials section (for Assignment 2) Section 5.1: Cross-Validation Week 3: We cover evaluation and model selection methods that you can use to help understand and optimize the performance of your machine learning models. For this week's assignment, you will train a classifier to detect spam email, analyze its performance with different evaluation metrics, and then optimize the classifier's performance based on different evaluation metrics, depending on the goals of the detection task (e.g. to minimize false positives vs false negatives). Readings: Section 5.3.1: Evaluation introduction and goals Section 5.3.3: Multi-class evaluation Section 5.3.5: Using evaluation metrics in model selection Section 5.4: Summary and outlook Week 4: We will cover more advanced supervised learning methods that include ensembles of trees (random forests, gradient boosted trees), and neural networks (with an optional summary on deep learning). You will also learn about the critical problem of data leakage in machine learning and how to detect and avoid it. The final assignment brings everything together: you will design features for, and build your own classifier on, a prediction problem on a complex real-world dataset. Readings: Section 2.3.4: Naïve Bayes Section 2.3.5: Decision Trees Section 2.3.6: Ensembles of Decision Trees Section 2.3.8: Neural networks

## Grading And Course Checklist

I anticipate no major changes to this course grading scheme. However, as the course progresses, I reserve the right to offer additional bonus assessments or make minor adjustments/fixes as required, for any evaluation method in this course. If necessary, any such changes will always be done in a way that maximizes a student's grade across options.

Given the highly interdependent nature of MADS courses, it is essential that you properly cover all the topics in this course, each of which is important. Thus, you must "pass" ALL Assignments AND Quizzes to receive credit for this course. What does this mean? You "pass" an assignment or quiz by getting a minimum grade of 80% regardless of whatever late penalty might also apply. If by the end of the course you have any assignments or quizzes that you did not "pass", you will be given a course grade of "incomplete" until you submit those remaining assignments or quizzes to the level of a "pass". Example: You hand in Assignment 3 but only get a grade of 60%, which is less than 80% and thus not a "pass". You continue in the course, and to meet the above "pass" course requirement, a week later you finish the questions and achieve a score of 90% (ignoring late penalty) for Assignment 3. Thus, you now have a "pass" for Assignment 3. Your actual grade for Assignment 3 will be evaluated by the normal grading / late penalty scheme. In this case, it will be 60% (the maximum of your submission grades with late penalty included), not the 90% grade used to satisfy the "pass" criterion (which ignores the late penalty).

| Course Item                          | Percentage of Final |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | --------- |
| Grade                                |                     |
| Passing                              |                     |

## Late Submission Policy

Important! Please read and understand this section, and if anything is unclear, the instructors are happy to clarify. We realize that, now more than ever, the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra time in completing a course assignment or quiz. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy that gives you a limited number of flexible "late day" credits. You have **a total of two (2) free late days** to use during the course. One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. As an example, suppose you had two course late days left. Submitting any time within 24hrs of the original due date counts as using the first late day. Beyond that time, submitting any time within the next 24h counts as using the 2nd late day. After that, each additional 24h period accrues a 25% per day penalty as follows:
Once you have used up your late days, there is a 25% penalty for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late. **For example** , if the due date is 11:59 p.m. ET, Monday, and you have _no_ late days left, penalties would be: Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Tuesday:
25% deduction Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday: 50% deduction Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 75% deduction Submit after 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday:
100% deduction If you were to have **one late day** at the end of the term the submission policy would be as follows:
Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday: 25% deduction Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 50% deduction
... and so on as above.

Important: You **do not** need to explain or get permission to use late days. If you choose/need to use the available late days for a week's work, **you** will be responsible for designating which week(s) you wish to have the late day(s) applied. Your choice could impact your final course grade due to the assignment weighting described in the Grading and Course Checklist section above. Upon completion of all assignments, please Slack DM the course Instructor and Lecturer (s)(combined message) with your desired application of late days. Note that any submissions after the weekly deadline may be counted as a late submission for the week. This late policy applies to both assignments and quizzes .

Very Important: If you intend to work on and submit an assignment after the official last day of the course (e.g. you use late days to complete a week 4 assignment past the deadline), you must make sure to start your work early enough that any assistance you might need from the instructional team can be obtained no later than the last official day of the course (i.e. stated close of the session). There is no guarantee that assistance from instructional staff will still be available after the last day of the course, since their time will already be occupied preparing for the next session's courses.

Please note: Submitting your work on time is very important in this course. Do not leave the assignments for the last minute. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to stay on track, though the instructional team may reach out to you and ask you about your progress; if you fall behind it may be difficult to catch up, and you will be at risk for not succeeding in the course. Start early, finish on time! Important: Each week's assignments for this course are due on Mondays at 11:59 p.m. ET.

## Letter Grades

The grading scale for this course will be as follows:

| A+  | 97% |
| --- | --- |
