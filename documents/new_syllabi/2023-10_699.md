## Course Syllabus For Siads 699

Course Overview and Prerequisites The Capstone is a project-based course in which students propose and build end-to-end data science projects in their domains of interest. Students are asked to demonstrate mastery of data science concepts and methods from their MADS training and produce a creative, original, and technically rigorous portfolio piece. Projects will be supervised by instructors with regular peer review. The core of this class is a group data science project which will be independently designed and executed by students. The intention is to create a resume-worthy portfolio project in a format that is ready to share and present with the broader community of data science professionals. The following are prerequisites for Capstone 699:

- SIADS 694 & 695: Milestone II A and B - 1 data science application course (currently, these are SIADS 682: Social Media Analytics, SIADS
  680: Learning Analytics, SIADS 685: Search and Recommender Systems, and SIADS 688: Data Science for Social Good)

## Instructor And Course Assistants

- Instructors: Winston Featherly-Bean, Elle O'Brien, Michelle LeBlanc, Laura Stagnaro, Kyle Balog

  Learning Outcomes The core of this class is a group data science project which will be independently designed and executed by students. The intention is to create a resume-worthy portfolio project in a format that is ready to share and present with the broader community of data science professionals. Student groups will be submitting the following at the end of the course:

- A report that tells the story of your project. This can be formatted as a blog, a scientific
  manuscript, or something else.
- A GitHub repository full of the code required to reproduce your analysis and figures. Your
  repository should be documented with a nice, informative README so a data scientist from outside MADS could understand what you did!
  And one of the following high-level overviews of your work designed to be shared:

- A 3-5 minute video from your team about what you made. - A poster appropriate for a data science conference, such as the MIDAS Data Science Symposium.
  Student groups will participate in a midway check-in meeting with the teaching team and submit three informal video stand-ups throughout the course.

Note: All assignments are required to earn credit for this course. Typically, group deliverables are assigned a single grade that applies to every member of the group. In extenuating circumstances, faculty reserve the right to apply individual grades to each team member based on their contributions to the project. You will be notified if this option is invoked.

## Late Submission Policy

Several assignments cannot be turned in late: the team-matching survey, your three standups, and your midway-check-in. Credit cannot be awarded for these assignments if they are incomplete. All other assignments have a 10% penalty for each day they are late. This penalty is automatically assigned by Coursera.

Letter Grades and Course Grades Refer to the MADS Assignment Submission and Grading Policies section of the UMSI Student Handbook (access to Student Orientation course required). The grading scale for this course is as follows- note that an A+ can only be awarded at the discretion of the instructors . An A+ is a mark of a truly distinguished final project, and they are rare.

| A        | 90%       |
| -------- | --------- |
| B+       | 87%       |
| B        | 80%       |
| C+       | 77%       |
| -------- | --------- |
| C        | 70%       |
| D+       | 67%       |
| D        | 60%       |
| F        |           |

Academic Integrity/Code of Conduct Refer to the Academic and Professional Integrity section of the UMSI Student Handbook. (access to Student Orientation course required).

## Generative Ai Policy

You are welcome to use ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. You must cite these tools when you turn in your work, though. You must also take full responsibility for your submissionsâ€“any coding or conceptual errors will be graded as your own, regardless of whether they came from ChatGPT. In other words: proofread everything that comes out of generative AI before you turn it in.

Accommodations Refer to the Accommodations for Students with Disabilities section of the UMSI Student Handbook (access to the Student Orientation course required). Use the Student Intake Form to begin the process of working with the University's Office of Services for Students with Disabilities.

Accessibility Refer to the Screen reader configuration for Jupyter Notebook Content document to learn accessibility tips for Jupyter Notebooks.

Library Access Refer to the U-M Library's information sheet on accessing library resources from off-campus. For more information regarding library support services, please refer to the U-M Library Resources section of the UMSI Student Handbook (access to the Student Orientation course required).

Student Mental Health Refer to the University's Resources for Stress and Mental Health website for a listing of resources for students.

Student Services Refer to the Introduction to UMSI Student Life section of the UMSI Student Handbook (access to the Student Orientation course required).

## Technology Tips

- Recommended Technology
- This program requires Jupyter Notebook for completion of problem sets and Adobe or
  other PDF viewer for reading articles.
- Working Offline
- While the Coursera platform has an integrated Jupyter Notebook system, you can work
  offline on your own computer by installing Python 3.5+ and the Jupyter software packages. For more details, consult the Jupyter Notebook FAQ .
