## Syllabus Course Overview And Prerequisites

This course is the first exposure to visual exploration of data students will experience in the program. Where the data manipulation course leaves students with an understanding of how to transform data from files into meaningful data structures, this course will teach students how to look for (visually) aggregate patterns within the data. Importantly, this course reaffirms many of the degree prerequisites, by presenting visualizations using statistical examples which are germane to the area of exploratory data analysis activity. Further, learners will be aware of emerging toolkits for visual exploration of data in Python through an independent assignment.

Prior to this course, students should have an understanding of the pandas library, which is covered in Data Manipulation, and a firm understanding of quantitative measures, such as means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals.

## Learning Outcomes

1.  Create effective visuals for data, including line plots, bar charts, scatter graphs,     histograms, box plots, and heatmaps, all using python libraries;
2.  Relate the characteristics of data, such as the dimensionality of the data, central     tendency measures, and variance, with the appropriate visual exploration mechanisms;
3.  Understand basic statistical techniques and how they might be used in exploratory     data analysis;
4.  Use the python matplotlib package to create charts and visuals quickly as you engage     in other courses in this degree;
5.  Be aware of emerging new libraries for visual exploration of data with the python     language.

## Use Of External Resources And Services (E.G Chatgpt)

There are a number of exciting emerging technologies to help people both learn and be productive in computing, writing, and data science! It's a thrilling time, but also one where we need to reflect on our purpose in this class and how we might incorporate these into our learning, teaching, and credentialing activities. Please read the Guidelines for use of external resources and services for understanding reasonable behavior.
