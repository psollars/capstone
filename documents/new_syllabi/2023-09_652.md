## Course Communication Expectations

We will use Slack for most communication related to the class. We will monitor the channel and try to answer your questions as promptly as possible. This should not happen, but if we do not answer your question within 24 hours (not including weekends and holidays, of course), feel free to contact us again. We also encourage you to answer each other's questions and use this platform for discussion related to the class. While we will try our best to monitor and clarify or remove wrong or misleading responses, we cannot guarantee that all statements made by students are correct. Please remember to be civil and treat everyone with kindness and respect. If you prefer not to use Slack, please feel free to email anyone in the instructional team with comments or questions.

How to Get Help If you have questions concerning the degree program, encounter a technical issue with Coursera, or issues using Slack, please submit a report to the ticketing system at umsimadshelp@umich.edu . If you have an issue specific to the Coursera environment, you can also begin a live chat session with Coursera Technical Support (24/7) or view Coursera troubleshooting guide s. (you may be asked to log in to your Coursera account). For questions regarding course content, refer to the **Communications Expectations** section above.

## Learning Outcomes

- Recognize and categorize real world networked data (social, financial, biological, transportation, information, etc.) and represent them using the appropriate network type (directed, weighted, signed, multigraph, bipartite, etc.).
- Define, compute, and interpret basic network metrics such as distance, clustering, degree distribution, and centrality measures.
- Describe several network generative models and understand the properties of the networks they generate. - Define, compute, and implement several measures that can be used for link prediction using real world data. - Articulate and implement the dynamics and assumptions of several information diffusion models and be able to implement.
- Articulate the influence maximization problem and basic strategies and heuristics to solve it. - Articulate the community detection problem and understand its value in several applications. - Articulate and implement several approaches for community detection.

## Course Schedule

- This course begins on August 29 and ends on September 25.
- Weekly assignments and quizzes will be **due on Wednesdays at 11:59 pm** (Ann Arbor, Michigan time-Eastern Daylight Time - EST, UTC -5). Assignments and quizzes will be due on 9/6, 9/13, 9/20, 9/27. Note that the last deadline is after the official end of the course. If you prefer, you are welcome to submit your work earlier.

## Assignment And Quizzes

Assignments consist of a combination of programming and reflection questions. The goal of the assignments is to apply the theory covered in the lecture and readings and the programming covered in the NetworkX tutorials to analyze both real and synthetic networks. Assignments will be partly auto-graded and partly manually graded. Please refer to the document _Assignment Points Distribution_ on Coursera for the point distribution of all assignments. Quizzes consist of multiple-choice and numerical question. You will have 2 attempts to answer each question and you will be told which ones you answered correctly and incorrectly after each attempt. The goal of the quizzes is to assess your understanding of network theory. While you may choose to use NetworkX to answer some of the questions, this should not be necessary for most quiz questions.

Weekly Office Hours via Zoom (Ann Arbor, Michigan time):
Your instructor will hold weekly, synchronous office hours using the video-conferencing tool, Zoom. The schedule of office hours can be found by clicking on the **Live Events** link in the left-hand navigation menu. Additionally, all office hours will be recorded and archived so that you can retrieve them later. Archived office hours can be found by clicking on the **Resources** link in the left- hand navigation menu then clicking the **Archived Sessions** link.

## Technology Tips

- Recommended Technology
- This program requires Jupyter Notebook for completion of problem sets and Adobe or other PDF viewer for reading articles.
- Working Offline
- While the Coursera platform has an integrated Jupyter Notebook system, you can work offline on your own computer by installing Python 3.5+ and the Jupyter software packages. For more details, consult the Jupyter Notebook FAQ.
