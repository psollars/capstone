Please review this syllabus and the accompanying documents on the comprehensive exam and project components carefully: they contain important information on specific course timelines and policies that you are responsible for understanding. After reading, if there's something in any of the documents you think is at all ambiguous, missing, or unclear, you should contact the instructors and they will be happy to clarify.

## Course Overview And Prerequisites

This course has three top-level goals: (a) You'll undertake a project that you can add to your portfolio that demonstrates the skills you've learned so far, including supervised and unsupervised learning, and effective communication of data analytics results (written and visualization). (b) It's an opportunity for you to review and test your knowledge in a broad, comprehensive fashion across the main prerequisite courses, (c) It will provide a space for you to strengthen your knowledge of previous learning through deeper engagement with specific practice problems (for the comprehensive exam portion) and to explore different data analytics methods for a given problem (for the project components). As with Milestone I, Milestone II will comprise a comprehensive exam and a significant project. This course is a bridge between Milestone I, where the focus is on the exam, and the Capstone, where the focus is on the project. Therefore, Milestone II focuses on the project to a much greater extent than in Milestone I. Student groups will participate in check-in meetings with the teaching team and submit 2 informal video stand-ups throughout the course.

## Weekly Readings

There is introductory material during the first week of the course, but generally speaking, no weekly readings in this course.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will:

1.  (Competency) Propose a data science project based on SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-constrained).
2.  (Competency) Analyze a given machine learning problem (e.g. for supervised and unsupervised) and propose several possible approaches, being able to identify which approaches are preferred as well as possible tradeoffs among alternatives.
3.  (Literacy) Implement different learning frameworks for a learning problem, and different learning representations (feature engineering).
4.  (Competency) Conduct a correct and thorough evaluation (including e.g. ablation tests to identify important features, hyperparameter sensitivity, training data curves, conduct detailed failure analysis), together with a valid and effective comparison between the chosen approaches.
5.  (Literacy) Clearly communicate, via written report, results of each analysis, including effective choices of visualization.
6.  (Awareness) Be able to identify potential future enhancements or refinements that could be explored (without needing to know these methods specifically, but being aware of their possible relevance to the problems at hand.)

## Course Schedule

●
This course begins on Tuesday August 29, 2023 and ends Monday October 23, 2023. This is a two-month course and requires you to work on a project.
●
Group video standups are due in Slack by 11:59 pm (Ann Arbor, Michigan time - Eastern Time) on the following days:.
○
Thursday, September 28 by 11:59 pm (Ann Arbor, Michigan time - Eastern Time)
○
Tuesday, October 10 by 11:59 pm (Ann Arbor, Michigan time - Eastern Time)
●
For each standup, each student is required to respond with feedback to two (2) other teams about their standups by October 1 and October 13 of the standup week. There is a Coursera submission where you can add links to your team's submission and individual feedback submission .
●
There are also individual very brief check-ins for weeks 6 and 7. These are useful to understand e.g. if the workload is being fairly distributed as the deadline approaches, there are any other teams issues that an individual might wish to flag, where they or the team need help from the coach to resolve but would not necessarily be discussed in the public stand-up videos.

## Comprehensive Exam Component

There is a separate document describing the Milestone II comprehensive exam process that will be shared on day 1 of the course.

## Project Component

There is a separate document summarizing the Milestone II project component and guidelines, with link here: MADS Milestone II: Project Guidelines (FA2023)

## Grading And Course Checklist

Note that compared to Milestone 1, the weight of the project component has increased, so that it has been given considerably more weight than the comprehensive exam component. We anticipate no major changes to this course grading scheme. However, as the course progresses, we may make minor adjustments as circumstances require, for any evaluation method in this course. If changes are made, they will always be done in a way that maximizes your grade across options.

## You Must Complete All Assignments And Assessments, Regardless Of Their Weighting In The Final Grade, To Get Credit For This Course.

## Letter Grades, Course Grades

Refer to the MADS Assignment Submission and Grading Policies section of the UMSI Student Handbook (access to Student Orientation course required). Standups are due on the indicated calendar days and comments on other students' standup are due within 2 days of posting videos; no partial credit will be awarded for late submissions to do with standups.

## Late Submission Policy

Because of the group project focus and dependencies between stages in Milestone 2, the previous "free late days" policy has been removed. Unless otherwise indicated, there is now a simple 25% penalty for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that a graded item is late. For example, if the due date is 11:59pm Monday, late penalties would be as follows. Submitted any time before 11:59pm Tuesday: 25% deduction Submitted any time before 11:59pm Wednesday 50% deduction Submitted any time before11:59pm Thursday: 75% deduction Submitted after 11:59pm Friday: 100% deduction Note that resubmissions after the deadline will be counted as late submissions. All items that are required must still be handed in, even if the late penalty would result in a grade of zero for that item. We have a strict policy that no waivers or extensions will be considered for any deadline except in the case of a documented emergency, so please do not send inquiries about extensions unless you have a documented emergency. This policy applies to all graded items (even those that are low stakes), including the final project. Please note: Submitting your work on time is very important in this course: there are important dependencies between some items, e.g. peer feedback must be on time in order to give teams enough time to incorporate changes for the final revision. Also, it is important to check in regularly with your project coach on team progress: if you fall behind in your project work your team will likely be overwhelmed and you will be at risk for not succeeding in the course. The grading scale for this course is as follows:

| A+  | 97% |
| --- | --- |
| A   | 93% |
| A-  | 90% |
| B+  | 87% |
| B   | 83% |
| B-  | 80% |
| C+  | 77% |
| C   | 73% |
| C-  | 70% |
| D+  | 67% |
| D   | 63% |
| D-  | 60% |
| F   | 0%  |

## Re-Grade Policy

If students would like any assignment in this course re-graded, that request must take place within 1 week of the student receiving the grade, and be made in writing via **email** (not Slack). The instructional team is happy to accommodate this request; however, students should be aware that requests for re-grading open the entire assignment up for re-grading, not just the portion requested by the student. Therefore, a request for a re-grade could result in a total grade going up, or going down. The result of the re-grade is final: no additional requests for further consideration of the same assignment will be granted.
