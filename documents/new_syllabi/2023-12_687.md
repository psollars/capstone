## Siads 687 Syllabus Course Overview And Prerequisites

In this course students will study how supervised machine learning techniques are applied in the domain of sports analytics including in individual sporting events, team events, and emerging wearable sensor technologies. Students will engage in applying their knowledge of machine learning through a hands-on competition in one or more sports analytics domains. There are no course prerequisites.

## Grading

Readings and reflections for the first three weeks of the course are mandatory (i.e. you must pass them) in order to gain a passing grade for the course but do not factor into the final letter grade. The final grade of the course depends upon the score achieved in the MADS Sports Analytics Invitational. In keeping with the norms of machine learning competitions, only five (5) submissions will be allowed for the MADS Sports Analytics Invitational by each student. In this course, two (2) of those submissions will be in the pre-season (the first ten days of the course) and three (3) in the playoffs (the rest of the course). The best score in the playoffs will be used to determine the student's letter grade for the course. In extraordinary circumstances, the instructor may allow for additional submissions to be considered.

The letter grade will be determined **in part** by hitting different thresholds of the autograder using the table below, keeping in mind that lower scores are better:

| Score on holdout   | Letter grade |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| <= 0.27            | A            |
| >0.27 but <= 0.30  | B            |
| > 0.30 but <= 0.33 | C            |

Within each of the C and B bands the instructional team will examine the last student submission to read the notebook and may apply a modifier as they see fit (including a completely different letter grade). You are highly encourages to take this opportunity to do exploratory analysis, make your code clean, describe with comments, and demonstrate your abilities.

In keeping with the nature of both sport and machine learning competitions, the best score for the MADS Sports Analytics Invitational will be declared the winner of the course, and afforded an A+ for their performance. Ties are allowed, in which multiple A+ grades will be awarded. In extraordinary circumstances, the instructor may award additional A+ grades. Please note: an A+ at the University of Michigan School of Information contributes the same as an A to your grade point average, and is only a recognition of excellence.
