## Course Syllabus For Siads 516: Big Data: Scalable Data Processing Course Overview And Prerequisites

This course will introduce students to the use of the Spark data analysis framework for the analysis of Big Data. We will cover the theory and application of MapReduce strategies, the use of Resilient Distributed Datasets in cluster computing, and higher-level abstractions such as DataFrames and SparkSQL, which facilitate efficient analysis of large amounts of data. The prerequisites for SIADS 516 include: SIADS 505: Data Manipulation SIADS 511: SQL & Databases

## Learning Outcomes

## Course Schedule

●
This course begins on Tuesday, November 21st, 2023, and ends on Monday, December 18th, 2023.
●
Weekly assignments will be **due on Mondays at 11:59 pm** (Ann Arbor, Michigan time-Eastern Standard/Daylight Time - EDT, UTC -4).
In **Week 1**, after some discussion of how we can define Big Data, you will be introduced to the split-apply-combine workflow common in Big-Data work. After overviewing scaling of distributed systems, week one progresses further into discussing how one can use libraries such as MapReduce, Hadoop, and MrJob for distributed solutions to big-data problems. In **Week 2**, the course shifts focus towards introducing the Apache Spark functionality, structure, and stack. After further exploring the relationship between Spark and Hadoop, students will learn about the creation and manipulation of resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) using Spark and Python. In **Week 3**, you will focus on working with Spark dataframes, including initialization from various file-types, column manipulation, and operations such as sorting, grouping, and user-defined functionality. In **Week 4**, the course shifts focus to Spark's support for Structured Query Language (SQL) and explores methods available for data selection, filtration, and cross-table joining with SQL and Spark.

## Weekly Office Hours Via Zoom (Ann Arbor, Michigan Time):

Your instructor will hold weekly, synchronous office hours using the video-conferencing tool, Zoom. The schedule of office hours can be found by clicking on the **Live Events** link in the left-hand navigation menu. Additionally, all office hours will be recorded and archived so that you can retrieve at a later date. Archived office hours can be found in the last lesson for each week with the heading **SIADS 516 Office Hour Recordings**.

## Letter Grades, Course Grades, And Late Submission Policy

We realize that the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra time in completing a course assignment. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy that gives you a limited number of flexible "late day" credits. You have three (3) free late days to use during SIADS 516. One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. Once you have used up your late days, 25% penalty for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late. For example, if the due date is 11:59pm Monday, with no late days left, penalties would be: Before 11:59pm Tuesday: 25% deduction Before 11:59pm Wednesday: 50% deduction Before 11:59pm Thursday: 75% deduction After 11:59pm Thursday: 100% deduction You don't need to explain or get permission to use late days, and we will track them for you. Note that resubmissions after the deadline will be counted as late submissions. The grading scale for this course is as follows:

| A   | 95%   |
|-----|-------|
| A-  | 90%   |
| B+  | 87%   |
