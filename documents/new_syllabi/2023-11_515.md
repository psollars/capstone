Familiarity with the linux command-line interface Understanding generators, memoizing and cacheing Debugging Efficient data structures Theory and measurement of complexity

## Course Schedule

This course begins on **Tuesday, October 24th** , and ends on **Monday, November 20th** . Weekly **assignments will be due on Mondays at 11:59 pm** (Ann Arbor, Michigan time- Eastern Daylight Time - EDT, UTC -4). In **Week 1** , you will be introduced to the linux command line interface (CLI) and you will learn basic data manipulation techniques without having to use Python. In **Week 2** , you will learn about iterators, generators, decorators, caching, and memoization -- all useful techniques to improve the writing and execution of your code. In **Week 3** , we will review some basic data structures, learn to use advanced ones to help with data manipulation, and debugging techniques for data science. In **Week 4** , we will discuss algorithmic complexity and look at how we can use profiling to improve the efficiency of our code.

## Weekly Office Hours Via Zoom (Ann Arbor, Michigan Time):

Your instructor will hold weekly, synchronous office hours using the video-conferencing tool, Zoom. The schedule of office hours can be found by clicking on the **Live Events** link in the lefthand navigation menu. Additionally, all office hours will be recorded and archived so that you can retrieve at a later date. Archived office hours can be found in respective module of the course. **Passcode is 515** for all office hours.

## Letter Grades, Course Grades, And Late Submission Policy

We realize that the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra time in completing a course assignment. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy that gives you a limited number of flexible "late day" credits. You have three (3) free late days to use during SIADS 515. One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. Once you have used up your late days, 25% penalty for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late. For example, if the due date is 11:59pm Monday, with no late days left, penalties would be:
Before 11:59pm Thursday: 25% deduction Before 11:59pm Friday: 50% deduction Before 11:59pm Saturday: 75% deduction After 11:59pm Sunday: 100% deduction You don't need to explain or get permission to use late days, and we will track them for you. Note that resubmissions after the deadline will be counted as late submissions. The grading scale for this course is as follows:

| A   | 95% |
| --- | --- |
| A-  | 90% |
| B+  | 87% |
| B   | 83% |
| B-  | 80% |
| C+  | 77% |
| C   | 73% |
| C-  | 70% |
| D+  | 67% |
| D   | 63% |
| D-  | 60% |
| F   | 0%  |
