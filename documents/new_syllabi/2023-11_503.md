# I. Course Basics Course Overview And Prerequisites

This class will teach you to recognize where ethical issues can arise when applying data science to real world problems. It will bring more analytic precision to ethical debates about the role that data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence play in consequential decision-making in commerce, employment, finance, healthcare, education, policing, and other areas. Largely through discussions of case studies, we will focus on ways to conceptualize, measure, and mitigate harm in data-driven decision-making. You will learn to think critically about how to plan and evaluate a data science project with ethical concerns in mind, and how to cope with novel challenges for which there are often no easy answers or established solutions.

To do so, you will learn key technical, ethical, policy, and legal terms and concepts that are relevant to ethical assessment in data science; learn about some of the common approaches and emerging tools for mitigating or managing these ethical concerns; and gain exposure to readings that will help you understand the current ethical and regulatory environment and to anticipate future developments. Ultimately, the class will teach you how to reason through these problems in a systematic manner and how to justify and defend your approach to dealing with them.

The prerequisites for this course are admission into the Masters in Applied Data Science program and successful completion of SIADS 501, "Being a Data Scientist."

Members of the instructional team play different roles:

- Melissa and Merve have recorded course videos and iterated course content (e.g. readings, assignments, and quizzes) since the course was launched in 2020. They, along with Nick and Ruth, look forward to interacting with you about course concepts and other content on Slack and in office hours.
- The lecturers supporting SIADS 503 - Melissa, Merve, Nick, and Ruth - should be your first point of contact for everything related to assignments and grading. They are here to support your learning, and will be happy to help you get the support you need to be successful in the course. (Please see "how to get help" below)
- The other team members supporting SIADS 503 - Alexis, Emily and Mike - will spend most of their time behind the scenes grading your work, but you may also engage with them in Office Hours, or on Slack.

## Communications Expectations

Slack is the primary communication mechanism between the instructional team and students for this course. If you do not use Slack, you will likely miss out on important updates, feedback, and discussions on topics of interest to the course.

- Course channel in Slack = siads503_fa23_001
- Slack response time: within 24 hours; weekend responses may be longer - Email response time: N/A; please use Slack
- Office Hours: Wednesday 5 - 6 PM (Eastern (Ann Arbor) time), and Sunday 11 am - 12 pm (Eastern (Ann Arbor) time). Please refer to the Live Events page on Coursera.

## How To Get Help

This is a large class, but it's still easy to get help if you need it:

- _Questions likely to be of general interest to other students in the class:_ please post to the course Slack channel. Note that there will be pinned posts for conversations about each of the four weekly assignments.
- _To request additional individualized feedback or support on weekly assignments:_ If you got feedback that you are having trouble understanding, or perhaps you disagree with it and would like some substantive advice on how to improve in future weeks, please follow these steps:
  - Write up as specific a question as you can, including enough context for the instructor team to understand it. Be sure to include your best interpretation of what the feedback is telling you.
  - Send a Slack DM to **ALL FOUR of the following lecturers** : @Melissa Chalmers, @Merve Hickok, @Nick Sheltrown, and @Ruth Corddry. One of us will get back to you in the shared slack thread, usually within 24 hours.
- _If you have questions concerning the degree program or encounter issues using Slack_ , please email umsimadshelp@umich.edu
- If you have an issue specific to the Coursera environment, you can begin a live chat session with Coursera Technical Support (24/7) or view Coursera troubleshooting guides . (You may be asked to log in to your Coursera account).

## Required Textbook

You will be given a list of required and recommended readings within the course and also below in Course Schedule (section II). For more information, see Further Readings/Listenings (section III). Online access to these readings is provided through the University of Michigan Library or through approved online sources. For resources provided through the library, you will be asked to sign in with your UMich uniqname and password to access these materials. This course does not require the purchase of a textbook.

## Course Learning Outcomes

1. Understand the most critical concepts and principles of ethics that apply to data science and outcomes.
2. Identify potential harms of data collection, aggregation, analysis, and use typically found in applied data science contexts.
3. Identify potential causes of bias and discrimination using data, and evaluate whether a data-driven system is discriminatory to any system stakeholders.
4. Remain vigilant of potential discriminatory outcomes when building data science solution(s); engage in multidisciplinary conversations to actively work against discrimination for solution(s) stakeholders.
5. Understand, identify, and discuss how data and algorithms have been used to perpetuate racism; Introduce how to correct, combat, and prevent racism using anti-racist data and algorithmic practices.
6. Apply course concepts to written ethical assessments and recommendations (e.g. a memorandum) for applied data science use cases (e.g. automated decision-making systems).
7. Articulate reasoning behind the most important ethical challenges of data science as applied to course domains of privacy, bias/classification, provenance/aggregation, power imbalances, accountability/consequences.

Please note that you will also see "Learning Objectives" listed at the start of each week. Think of these as "Goals for This Week."

## Course Structure

Each week, this course consists of **recorded lectures, required and recommended readings** , and two **office hours** produced by the teaching team. Lectures consist of overview material about concepts as well as the discussion of case studies. In addition, a guest speaker will visit or we will take a field trip. This will provide one or more additional recorded lectures, interviews, or conversations. Lectures supplement but do not always review or duplicate the readings; readings supplement but do not always duplicate the lectures. That means some of the course content is available only from a lecture or a reading. For instance a concept may not be mentioned in a lecture, but it may be the key point of a reading. Students are still responsible for that material.

A low-stakes, open-book weekly **quiz** will provide an incentive to keep up with the readings/lecture content. The primary work of the course is one writing assignment each week.

Office hours offer us the opportunity for the teaching team and students to discuss course topics more informally; there will be opportunities for both student-generated questions and conversation as well as teaching-team led presentations of content related to both course topics and assignments. We also hope to welcome some guests to shed light on how ethics issues manifest in real-life professional situations.

Specific information for each week is below in Course Schedule (section II).

## Letter Grades, Course Grades, And Late Submission Policy

Refer to the MADS Assignment Submission and Grading Policies section of the UMSI Student Handbook (access to Student Orientation course required)

Final letter grades for the course will be calculated using the following scale: A+ 98%+; A 93-97%; A- 90-92%; B+ 87-89%; B 83-86%; B- 80-82%; C+ 77-79%; C 73-76%; C- 70-72%; D+ 67-69%; D 63-66%; D- 60-62%; E 59% or below. Coursera does not round up or down (e.g. 86.78% = B).

Late submissions receive 10% penalty per day.

## Regrade Requests Policy

Graders may make mistakes. Gradescope has a system for regrade requests; please use it to request review of an assignment, and describe why you think that the initial grading was incorrect. Regrade requests will be handled by a different grader. The entire assignment will be regraded, applying all elements of the grading rubric. Your grade could go up or down.

## Revise And Resubmit

You will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit **one** assignment. This is not required, but is rather an opportunity to recover from a misstep and earn additional points by responding to feedback and improving your submission. Your revised assignment may earn up to the median score for that assignment. The assignment will be graded using the same rubric as the initial submission. We do not begin with the median grade and then subtract points, but instead add points as usual and award points up to and including the median score. Points above the median score will not be reflected in your grade. Median score for each assignment will be posted on Slack after the grades are released.

# IV. Additional Course Policies

## Academic Integrity Collaboration

UMSI strongly encourages collaboration while working on some assignments, such as work on team projects and interpreting reading assignments as a general practice. Active learning is effective. You must, however, write your individual assignment submissions on your own, in your own words. You should not collaborate on quizzes. Read the instructions carefully and request clarification about collaboration when in doubt.

## Plagiarism

Unless otherwise specified in an assignment, all submitted work must be your own original work. Any excerpts, statements, or phrases from the work of others must be clearly identified as a quotation, and a proper citation provided (inline and reference list). Ideas and concepts from course or external materials used in assignment submissions must also be properly cited (inline and in a reference list). If you do not cite the source of the ideas or quotations you use, this is considered plagiarism.

In this course, an assignment containing plagiarized material will receive zero points. This applies whether the plagiarism is intentional or inadvertent. Any violation of the School's policy on Academic and Professional Integrity (stated in the MADS Student Handbook ) will also be reported to UMSI Student Affairs.

The University Library also offers information about academic integrity and how you can protect yourself. If you are unsure about whether a passage in your writing constitutes plagiarism, you are encouraged to seek help from the teaching team or from the Sweetland Writing Center. Be sure to plan sufficiently ahead in your writing so that you can receive and incorporate feedback if you are uncertain about the boundaries of plagiarism.

AI-generated text tools: ChatGPT is a new AI product that has become very popular over the last few months. It is a generative AI tool that uses large language models to produce answers and responses to questions. There are many potentially productive uses of ChatGPT (and likely some important ethical questions), but the use of ChatGPT or any other AI-generated text tool to write text for class assignments is not allowed. Any assignments found to have used ChatGPT to write text for course assignments will earn zero points.
