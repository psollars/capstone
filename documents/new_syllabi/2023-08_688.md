## Learning Outcomes

- Recognize the class of mechanisms that would be appropriate to nudge pro-social behavior, such as social comparison,   goal setting, leader boards, and team competition;
- Evaluate the impact of such mechanisms either through a field experiment (RCT) or other exogenous policy changes; and - Know when to and when not to apply a specific causal inference technique, such as instrumental variables, regression   discontinuity design, and difference-in-differences analysis   Weekly Office Hours via Zoom (Ann Arbor, Michigan time):   Your instructor will hold weekly, synchronous office hours using the video-conferencing tool, Zoom. The schedule of office hours can be found by clicking on the **Live Events** link in the left-hand navigation menu. The recordings can be found at the end of the corresponding week. Passcode is 688.

## Assignments And Grading You Are Expected To Read An Assigned Paper On Perusall Before Watching Each Lecture, And Complete A Problem Set Afterwards.

- Weekly (4) Perusall reading assignments are each worth 5% of your total grade - Data problem sets (3) are each worth 20% of your total grade
- The final paper in Week 4 is worth 20% of your grade

## Data Problem Sets Assignment 1

- Analysis of a data set from a field experiment using social information intervention to reduce traffic violations   (Chen et al. 2017).
- The data set contains the traffic violation record of 395,204 cars over a 10-month period in 2013 in Tsingtao,   China. The researchers implemented their intervention at the end of the 9th month, and used the 10th month data for impact evaluation.
- Techniques: Poisson regressions, clustering of standard errors   Assignment 2
- Analysis of a field experiment designed to nudge people to reduce their water usage (Ferraro and Price 2013). - The data set comes from a field experiment in the metro Atlanta area. - Techniques: Heterogeneous treatment effects, impact evaluation   Assignment 3
- Analysis of two Kiva data sets to practice the use of instrumental variable regressions. - The data sets for Ai et al. (2016) contains an intervention that evaluates the effects of team membership on   prosocial lending. To argue for exclusion restriction, one needs to use the Chen et al. (2017) data set.
- The data sets contain Kiva lending activities from two field experiments. - Techniques: Instrumental variable regressions, inclusion and exclusion restrictions   Note: All assignments are required to earn credit for this course.

Original Work Policy Collaboration : I strongly encourage collaboration while working on homework problems. Active learning is effective. Collaboration will be especially valuable in summarizing the reading materials and picking out the key concepts. You must, however, write your homework submission on your own, in your own words, before turning it in. If you work with someone on the homework before writing it, you must list any and all collaborators on your written submission.

Plagiarism : All written submissions must be your own, original work. Original work for narrative questions is not mere paraphrasing of someone else's completed answer: you must not share written answers with each other at all. At most, you should be working from notes you took while participating in a study session. Largely duplicate copies of the same assignment will receive an equal division of the total point score from the one piece of work. You may incorporate selected excerpts from publications by other authors, but they must be clearly marked as quotations and must be attributed. If you build on the ideas of prior authors, you must cite their work. You may obtain copy editing assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others, but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own, or be explicitly attributed to another. See the Rackham Graduate policy on Academic and Professional Integrity for the definition of plagiarism, and associated consequences.

If you are late submitting an assignment, the following late policy will typically apply: 15% reduction if assignment is turned in one day late, 30% reduction if two days late, 45% reduction if three days late, and a zero (0) if four or more days late.

The grading scale for this course is as follows:

| Percentage | Letter    |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Grade      |           |
| A+         | 98 and up |
| A          | [95 - 98) |
| A-         | [90-95)   |
| B+         | [85-90)   |
| B          | [80-85)   |
| B-         | [75-80)   |
| C+         | [70-75)   |
| C          | [65-70)   |
| C-         | [60-65)   |
| D+         | [55-60)   |
| D          | [50-55)   |

## Technology Tips

- Recommended Technology
- This program requires Jupyter Notebook for completion of problem sets and Adobe or other PDF viewer for   reading articles.
- Working Offline
- While the Coursera platform has an integrated Jupyter Notebook system, you can work offline on your own   computer by installing Python 3.5+ and the Jupyter software packages, including pyspark. For more details, consult the Jupyter Notebook FAQ .
