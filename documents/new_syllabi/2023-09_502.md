## Course Syllabus Mads 502: Math Methods For Data Science Course Overview

There are no prerequisites for this course. This course will review and introduce some mathematical concepts relevant to applied data science. It will cover important concepts in linear algebra, probability, and statistics. Week 1 covers some math basics about sets, types of numbers, types of proofs, functions, derivatives, optimization, exponents, logarithms, Euler's number, and natural logarithms. It also covers Part 1 of the unit on Linear Algebra, specifically vector operations with math and with Python and the concepts of span, basis, and linear independence. Week 2 is Part 2 of the unit on Linear Algebra. It covers matrix operations with math and with Python, the concept of matrices as linear mappings, determinants, traces, and some basics about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Week 3 is the unit on Probability. It covers the concepts of random variables, introduces some important discrete and continuous distributions, expectation, variance, conditional probability, independence, Bayes' rule, and Monte Carlo simulations. Week 4 is the unit on Statistics. It covers the Central Limit Theorem, hypothesis testing, some math and interpretation of OLS regressions and logistic regressions, and a little bit about maximum likelihood.

## Communication Expectations

- Most questions about the lectures and the assignments should be posted on the Slack channel for the course, so that other students can see the questions, offer their answers and ideas, and see the final answers. Please do not post code related to specific assignment questions (see below).
- If your question is about your specific code for an assignment question, please send a Slack please send one Slack direct message to all of the teaching staff at once. Make sure to include (a) the assignment number and the question number that your question is about, (b) a clean, minimal version of your attempted code, (c) the output of your code, (d) the error message if any, and (e) a short explanation of what your approach to the problem has been.
- Typically instructors will respond to a Slack post or direct message within 24 hours. If you have not received a response in 48 hours, please resend.

## Assignments And Late Policy

This course has four assignments. You have unlimited attempts for each assignment. For any attempt made between 0-24h after the deadline, a 15% late penalty will be applied to the entire attempt. For any attempt made between 24-48h after the deadline, a 30% late penalty will be applied to the entire attempt. For any attempt made between 48-72h after the deadline, a 45% late penalty will be applied to the entire attempt. For any attempt made 72h or more after the deadline, a 100% late penalty will be applied to the entire attempt. Your official grade on the assignment will be the maximum of the grades on your attempts of the assignment. For example, if you attempt an assignment four times and receive the grades 50, 75, 80, 85 (100 with a 15% late penalty), then your official grade on the assignment would be 85. For another example, if you attempt an assignment five times and receive the grades 20, 50, 87, 76.5 (90 with a 15% late penalty), and 70 (100 with a 30%) late penalty, then your official grade on the assignment would be 87 Each student starts the course with one "free pass," which allows them to choose one week of the course (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, or Week 4) and extend the deadlines for all of that week's assessment by three days (72 hours). In order to use your free pass, simply DM everyone on the instructional team (in one DM) and say that you would like to use your free pass for a certain week's assessments.
