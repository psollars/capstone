## Syllabus For Siads 602:Math Methods Ii Course Overview And Prerequisites

 The prerequisite for SIADS 602 is SIADS 502: Math Methods for Data Science. This course will provide a deeper dive into some of the topics covered in SIADS 502 with specific attention on Linear Algebra and Optimization. Each week there will be one quiz and one programming assignment. Week 1  starts the unit on Linear Algebra. The topics  covered are orthogonal vectors and matrices, orthogonal projections, and the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm. Week 2  continues the unit on Linear Algebra. The topics  covered are trace, determinant, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, positive definite matrices, and singular value decomposition. Week 3  is the unit on Probability and Distributions.  The topics covered are permutations, combinations, famous distributions, entropy, KL divergence, and some limit theorems. Week 4  is the unit on Optimization. The topics covered  are vector calculus, necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality, gradient descent, and maximum likelihood. 

## Instructional Staff

 - 
 Instructor: 
 Hanna Hoover (hooverha@umich.edu) 
 - 
 Assistant Instructors: Saurabh Budholiya (srbh@umich.edu),  Alexis Castellanos (acastel@umich.edu>, 

## Communication Expectations

 - 
 Most questions about the lectures and the assignments should be posted on the Slack channel for the course, so that other students can see the questions, offer their answers and ideas, and see the final answers. Please do not post code related to specific assignment questions (see below). 
 - 
 If your question is about your specific code for an assignment question,  please send a Slack direct message to all of the teaching staff  .  Make sure to include (a) the assignment number and the question number that your question is about, (b) a clean, minimal version of your attempted code, (c) the output of your code, (d) the error message if any, and (e) a very short explanation of what your approach to the problem has been. 
 - 
 Typically instructors will respond to a Slack post or direct message within 24 hours. If you have not received a response in 36 hours, please resend. 

## Help Desk: How To Get Help

 For technical or platform problems (Coursera, Slack, etc.), please email umsimadshelp@umich.edu.

## Quizzes, Assignments, And Late Penalties

 This course has four quizzes. For each quiz, there is also a practice quiz. The practice quiz will be exactly the same as the real quiz except for two things: (a) your score on the practice quiz does not count towards your final grade, but your score on the real quiz does, and (b) the feedback you receive after you submit a practice quiz is "limited" (i.e. you will learn which questions you answered correctly and which ones you answered incorrectly), but the feedback you receive after you submit a real quiz is "full" (i.e. in addition to the limited feedback, you will receive an explanation about why the correct answer is the correct answer).  **For each  real quiz, you only get one attempt**  . If your submission for a real quiz is made between 0-24h after the deadline will receive a 15% late penalty. If your submission for a real quiz is made between 24-48h after the deadline will receive a 30% late penalty. If your submission for a real quiz is made between 48-72h after the deadline will receive a 45% late penalty. If your submission for a real quiz is made 72h or more after the deadline will receive a 100% late penalty. This course has four assignments. You have unlimited attempts for each assignment. For any attempt made between 0-24h after the deadline, a 15% late penalty will be applied to the entire attempt. For any attempt made between 24-48h after the deadline, a 30% late penalty will be applied to the entire attempt. For any attempt made between 48-72h after the deadline, a 45% late penalty will be applied to the entire attempt. For any attempt made 72h or more after the deadline, a 100% late penalty will be applied to the entire attempt. Your official grade on the assignment will be the maximum of the grades on your attempts of the assignment. For example, if you attempt an assignment four times and receive the grades 50, 75, 80, 85 (100 with a 15% late penalty), then your official grade on the assignment would be 85. For another example, if you attempt an assignment five times and receive the grades 20, 50, 87, 76.5 (90 with a 15% late penalty), and 70 (100 with a 30%) late penalty, then your official grade on the assignment would be 87. Each student starts the course with one "free pass," which allows them to choose  one week of the course  (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, or Week 4) and extend  the deadlines for all of that week's assessment by three days (72 hours).  In order to use your free pass, simply DM everyone on the instructional team (in one DM) and say that you would like to use your free pass for a certain week's assessments.
