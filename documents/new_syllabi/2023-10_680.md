## SIADS 680: Learning Analytics Course Syllabus Course Overview And Prerequisites

SAIDS 680 provides an overview of a key application domain for data scientists—education. In this course students will examine the application of data science as a means to better understand and improve learning. Specifically, students will think critically about the ways in which data scientists can support research and improvement in educational organizations of all types. Anchored in the fields of learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM), this course analyzes the unique opportunities and challenges associated with applying data science methods to data stemming from schools, universities, and a myriad of learning opportunities. The course will cover the history of learning analytics, typical data and methods used, the importance of measurement, and the implementation of learning analytics products. The prerequisites for this course are fulfilled by having completed the coursework necessary to achieve Milestone II.
