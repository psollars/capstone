   Course Overview and Prerequisites
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  Data scientists need to be able to present their analyses to clients and stakeholders, sometimes “translating” to those without statistical or data fluency. You will learn strategies for effective visual, written, and oral communication and create a technical report and oral presentation for your professional portfolio.

    : Slack is preferred for questions relating to course  structure, assignment clarifications, and other questions and conversations that the group would benefit from. Posts received by 7pm Eastern will receive a same-day response; posts after 7pm Eastern will  receive a response within 24 hours. As has been done in other MADS  classes, we are going to set up separate threads for each week under  which you can post your questions. If you’d like to ask a private  question, please send a direct message to all instructional staff, instead of to an individual instructor, so that your questions can be answered more quickly. This also helps keep the instructional staff on the same page as we work through issues, because we see each other's answers.

   Technology Requirements (unique to this course)
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  All course activities can be completed using core MADS technology. Students may choose from a variety of tools -- including software they own or can access for free that is not part of the MADS package -- to complete course requirements. For example, students wishing to go beyond the provided templates and create custom designs may opt to use graphic tools of their choice, and students. However, some students may wish to trace, and then adapt, existing visualizations. For those who do, we recommend but do not require the free, open-source tool
  <a href="https://inkscape.org/" title="">
   <u>
    Inkscape
   </u>
  </a>
  (a tutorial is provided in Week 3). While you do not need to conduct any computational analysis for this course, optional blank Jupyter notebooks are available for those who would like them.

   Grading
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  There are two project options students can choose: either the traditional project (where you develop a business brief for a fast casual dining, hockey, or micro-financing organization) or the alternative project (where you finish a model that predicts employee turnover). Both projects have the same deliverables, though the due date schedule works differently depending on which project you select.

   Late Submissions
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  This course moves at a rapid pace. Because we use the same scenario throughout the four weeks, getting behind can snowball for you. To incentivize you to stay on track, there is a 15% daily penalty (including weekends) for work submitted late. However, life moves at a rapid pace, too. If you have an extenuating circumstance that will preclude you from submitting work on time, please send the instructors a private message on slack
  <em>
   prior to the due date of the assignment
  </em>
  and we will take that into consideration. Please do what you can to plan ahead so we can all be as proactive as possible.

  <strong>
   Collaboration, Plagiarism, and Synthesis
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  UMSI is a professional school, and professionals converse with one another when making sense of concepts and ideas, as well as to get informal feedback. We know that MADS students come from a wide range of backgrounds and that use of others’ work may be OK in some situations (like a course that encourages you to build on existing code libraries) and not in others (creating reports for this class). The course is designed to provide a wide variety of pathways and scenarios so as to minimize similarity between assignments. You must, however, create original work by yourself. Original work is not mere paraphrasing of someone else's completed answer or substituting words from existing text. Your work should have a strong sense of unique thinking; that is, it should transcend merely stringing together sentences and thoughts expressed by others, and your own synthesis should be evident in your work. Said differently, we are looking for your perspective and decision-making, supported by evidence you gather (and cite) from others.  You may trace existing visualizations if you acknowledge the source graphic in your citations. All written submissions must be your own, original work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Largely duplicate copies of the same assignment will receive an equal division of the total point score from the one piece of work. You may incorporate selected excerpts, statements or phrases from publications by other authors, and you should be referencing data from a variety of sources in your decision-making  but they must be clearly marked as quotations (for text) and must be attributed (text, data, and images). If you build on the ideas of prior authors, you must cite their work.
 </p>
 <p>
  You may obtain copyediting assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others, but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own, or be explicitly attributed to another. Please cite your work using a recognizable citation format of your choice (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago, Turabian, etc.). If you need assistance with this, both MLibrary and Sweetland Writing Center provide significant support -- or reach out and ask. We’d rather chat with you about your unique case than have you submit something you’re not sure about.
