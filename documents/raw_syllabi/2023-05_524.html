   Course Overview and Prerequisites
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course covers strategies and techniques for effective uncertainty visualization. Uncertainty communication is essential for data analysts to learn, both to better understand their data and to effectively communicate the implications of data and models to others. This class covers a wide variety of uncertainty visualization techniques, including continuous uncertainty encodings, intervals, and frequency-framing approaches. Students will learn how each technique impacts people’s ability to perceive and reason about uncertainty and what biases and pitfalls to be wary of when communicating uncertainty. Uncertainty visualization techniques are placed into a coherent theoretical foundation, the Grammar of Graphics, and programming exercises are conducted in a Grammar of Graphics-based API, Altair. Finally, as it is crucial to accurately represent the limits of our knowledge, strategies for dealing with large-world uncertainty (communicating uncertainty about model specifications themselves) will be discussed throughout.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Advisory Prerequisite
  </strong>
  : Visual Exploration of Data
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Enforced Prerequisites:
  </strong>
  Math Methods for Data Science, Information Visualization I
 </p>
 <p>
  Students should have seen different types of data plots (e.g., histograms, box plots) before entering the course (covered by the stats prerequisites), but they don’t need to be able to generate them through programming. Students should have an understanding of probability and Bayes’ rule (covered in Math Methods) and the Altair visualization library (covered in Infovis I).

     Contacting your instructor and course assistant(s):
    </strong>
    Use the course channel in Slack
    <strong>
     (siads524_ss23_001); for private messages the preferred method is to direct message us on Slack
    </strong>

     Slack response time:
    </strong>
    Slack is the preferred communication medium
    <strong>
     for any questions and conversations that the group would benefit from,
    </strong>
    such as questions relating to course structure, and assignment clarifications. Posts received by 5pm Eastern will receive a same-day response; posts after 5pm Eastern will receive a response within 24 hours. As has been done in other MADS classes, we are going to set up separate threads for each week under which you can post your questions. Please tag both instructors in your question so that we won't miss any questions posted. If you’d like to ask a private question, please send a direct message to both of us, instead of to an individual instructor, so that your questions can be answered more quickly. This also helps keep the instructional staff on the same page as we work through issues, because we see each other's answers.

   Late Submissions
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course moves at a rapid pace. To incentivize you to stay on track there is a 15% daily penalty (including weekends) if an assignment is turned in one day late, 30% reduction if two days late, 50% if reduction three days, and a zero (0) if four or more days late.

  <strong>
   Academic Integrity
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  Unless otherwise specified in an assignment all submitted work must be your own, original work. Any 
excerpts, statements, or phrases from the work of others must be clearly identified as a quotation, and a 
proper citation provided. Any violation of the School’s policy on Academic and Professional Integrity 
(stated in the Master’s and Doctoral Student Handbooks) will result in serious penalties, which might 
range from failing an assignment, to failing a course, to being expelled from the program. Violations of 
academic and professional integrity will be reported to UMSI Student Affairs. Consequences impacting 
assignment or course grades are determined by the faculty instructor; additional sanctions may be 
imposed by the assistant dean for academic and student affairs.

relationships, mental health, alcohol or other drugs, identities, finances, etc. If you are experiencing 
concerns, seeking help is a courageous thing to do for yourself and those who care about you. If the 
source of your stressors is academic, please contact me so that we can find solutions together. Ashley

aspects of the course design, course learning objects and the individual academic and course barriers 
experienced by the student. Further conversation with SSD, instructors, and the student may be

   Audio and Video Recording

 </h2>
 <p>
  Class Recordings
We will be doing audio and video recording of all office hour sessions to enable those who cannot attend office hours in 
person on a given day to access the content. These recordings will not be made available publicly. 
Recordings of all sessions will be available on Coursera only to students registered for this class. As part of 
your participation in office hours, you may be recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please contact 
the professor during the first week of class to discuss alternative arrangements. Students may not copy 
and share the office hour videos with those not in the class, or upload them to any other online environment 
(this is a violation of the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)).

Personal recordings are prohibited except with permission
Students are prohibited from recording/distributing any class activity without written permission from 
the instructor, except as necessary as part of approved accommodations for students with disabilities. 
Any approved recordings may only be used for the student’s own private use.
