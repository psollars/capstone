 <p>
  <strong>
   Overview
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This course provides an introduction to
  <em>
   qualitative
  </em>
  research methodology in a way tailored to data scientists. Through qualitative research, data scientists can gain hunches about, generate hypotheses, and develop narratives – all of which are useful in the analysis and reporting of quantitative data. Methodologically, this course focuses on
  <em>
   <strong>
    semi-structured interviews
   </strong>
  </em>
  , qualitative data analysis through
  <em>
   <strong>
    affinity mapping
   </strong>
  </em>
  , and the construction of
  <em>
   <strong>
    report narratives
   </strong>
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  Students will develop relevant skills through a project they identify in the first few days of the course.

     This course begins on Tuesday, May 30, 2023 and ends on Monday, June 26, 2023.

    Assignment
    <em>
     recommended
    </em>
    due dates vary by week. Please see the schedule below and pay attention to due dates. All items are due at
    <strong>
     11:59 pm, Eastern Time
    </strong>
    , on the date indicated (please see “Time Zones” note below).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Because this course has a different rhythm than most other MADS courses, due dates are flexible, and assignments will not be penalized for lateness unless they are submitted later than the last day of the course. You do NOT need request explicit permission to submit assignments late, but a message to let the instructor know that you may miss a due date is appreciated. Please also message us if an item you submitted is overdue for grading.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The posted due dates should thus be considered
    <em>
     strong recommendations,
    </em>
    so that you can stay on track through the course. In any case, you should not fall too far behind. All assignments must be turned in by the end of the course. The major assignments are sequential and must be completed in order; in addition, the latter three of five assignments have crucial dependencies on external interviewees.

    Discussion Participation: At three points during the course, you will be prompted to engage in light online discussion about the course content or assignments.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Peer Review: You will be asked to provide feedback to your peers on four assignments. Through these reviews, you will receive quick feedback on your own work, and also have a chance to see how others have completed their assignments.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Project Definition: Identify a data set, a broad question about it, and three data-set stakeholders who are willing to be interviewed by you. Those will compose a project definition that you use to practice all the skills taught throughout this course.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Interview Protocol: Write a protocol for the three interviews that you will conduct. The protocol includes an introduction section, a series of main questions and follow-up questions, and a conclusion section.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Data Extraction: Extract discrete items of qualitative data from the interviews that you have conducted.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Affinity Wall: Conduct qualitative data analysis through a process of hierarchical clustering and summarization.
   </p>

  <li>
   <p>
    Final Report: Write up the findings of your analysis in the framework of a coherent narrative.

   Note:
  </strong>
  The course requires conducting three semi-structured interviews. These are not graded, but are an essential part of the course. You will not be able to complete the last three assignments (worth a total of 45% of the course grade) without doing the interviews.

      This Medium article is the outcome of a UMSI MADS captone project by three students. You can see how they applied skills from SIADS 601 to better understand the context in which they were doing data analysis. One of the authors wrote, "I wanted to let you know that... if we hadn't engaged in this process [that we learned in SIADS 601] we would have produced something questionable to both radiologists and possibly even other data scientists." The students received an A+ on their project.

  Time Zones

 <p>
  All announced date/times will be in U.S. Eastern Time. Be aware that the United States transitions from Eastern
  <em>
   Standard
  </em>
  Time (EST) to Eastern
  <em>
   Daylight
  </em>
  Time (EDT) on March 14, 2021 (Sunday) at 2am, EST. At that point, Eastern Time moves forward by one hour (i.e., what used to be 2am becomes 3am). All assignments are due at 11:59pm ET on the date indicated. If you’re not used to working across time zones, you may find it useful to use an online time-zone converter, e.g.,
