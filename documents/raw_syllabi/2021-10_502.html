 </h2>
 <p>
  1a. Revisit basic algebra and notations to be used in this course and through the MADS program
 </p>
 <p>
  1b. Apply basic concepts of vectors, perform basic algebra operations using vectors
 </p>
 <p>

 </h2>
 <p>
  2a. Demonstrate basic linear algebra and computational properties of matrices including identifying linearity
 </p>
 <p>
  2b. Recognize how row reduction helps us calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
 </p>
 <p>
  2c. Discuss the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  3. Interpret Bayes Rule.
 </h2>
 <p>
  3a. (Re)introduce Bayes Theorem to students and its applications to data science. Give examples of how Bayes Theorem integrates with data science broadly
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  4. Explain Maximum likelihood estimation in the context of linear regression
 </h2>
 <p>
  4a. Explain the basics of likelihood and maximum likelihood concepts
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  5. Explain optimization techniques and their connection to mathematics and data science
 </h2>
 <p>
  5a. Describe how optimization works in everyday life, mathematics, and data science
 </p>
 <p>
  5b. Express the intuition of optimization techniques (gradient descent)
 </p>
 <p>
  5c. Identify canonical formulations for linear and logistic regression techniques
 </p>
 <p>
  5d. Express the intuition of loss functions and how they relate to optimization
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <strong>
   Week 1
  </strong>
  , you will review math concepts relevant to data science through (a) a review problem set designed to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses of math fundamentals, (b) lectures revisiting important algebraic concepts, introducing fundamental  linear algebra ideas, working with vectors and matrices, and (c) a graded problem set applying these concepts using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <strong>
   Week 2
  </strong>
  , you will be introduced to matrix decomposition, row reduction methods for matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and principal components. The programming assignment will require you to apply the week’s concepts using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <strong>
   Week 3
  </strong>
  , you will learn about methods of basic optimization techniques. We will cover the general ideas behind optimization, canonical formulations, loss functions, and gradient descent. This week has two assignments. The first will mathematically apply the week’s concepts using Python and Jupyter Notebook in a problem set, while the second will have you read a journal article which has incorporated some of the concepts we have covered and write a brief review.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <strong>
   Week 4
  </strong>
  , we will revisit probability and statistics and apply theories from the course to maximum likelihood methods for linear and logistic regression. You will have a graded problem set applying these methods using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
