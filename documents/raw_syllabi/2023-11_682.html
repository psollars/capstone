  Course Overview and Prerequisites
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course will introduce concepts and approaches to mining social media data. It focuses on obtaining and exploring those data, mining networks, and mining text from social platforms. The focus is less on learning new methods; rather, students will learn how to apply previously learned data mining concepts to a domain that will likely be familiar to all of them, social media. Students will learn to explore, model, and predict with network and textual data from existing social platforms

 <h2 level="2">
  Programming Lab
 </h2>
 <p>
  There is a lightly graded Programming Lab in this course that will require students to gain access to the an API of a social media platform, which requiring a developer account. The instructions for gaining this access are detail in the Lab.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why is this Lab about Reddit when the other assignments are about Twitter?
 </p>
 <p>
  Your weekly coding assignments deal with archived Twitter data, and we used to have a Twitter Lab to complement that. But, there have been a lot of changes (and mixed signals) surrounding free access to Twitter developer accounts in recent months. Perhaps Twitter will reverse itself again, but upon recent testing we were no longer able to access a free tier that accommodate our needs, so we looked for an alternative. This Lab as an alternative way to give you some "real world" experience accessing data from a different social media platform, Reddit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Important
  </strong>
  : Gaining access to a developer account in Reddit can take minutes to days -- if you plan to do the assignment in this class, please request this as early as possible to ensure you have appropriate time to complete your assignment.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Textbook and Readings Information
 </h2>
 <p>
  There is no textbook for this course; readings will be provided as pdfs or links.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Reading Reflections
 </h2>
 <p>
  Each week, there will be assigned readings and a 3-5 paragraph reading reflection due. Everyone in the class is expected to have read the required readings for that week’s topic. If you do not do the required readings, your understanding of the course material will suffer, as will your grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our engagement with these readings will take place in the form of written reading reflections that you submit to the instructors. We will engage in four ways:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Description
  </em>
  : statements or questions about what the author claims.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Critique
  </em>
  : arguments about whether the author is correct or what the author has left out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Connection
  </em>
  : how the claims or concepts relate to those in other readings.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Application
  </em>
  : how the reading applies to current events or platform issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will apply these techniques in your reading reflection, in the form of responding to one or more of a few prompts provided by the instructor. The goal of the reading reflection is to engage more deeply with the readings. A rubric is provided in Coursera to guide you in constructing your week’s written response.
 </p>
 <p>
  You are required to post your reading reflection—in plain text—to the appropriate pinned Slack thread for that week’s reading. You can also receive 0.5% extra credit for replying to another student’s reading reflection in that thread with a thoughtful comment.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Content Warnings
 </h2>
 <p>
  The content and discussion in this course will at times engage with potentially triggering content. Some of this will be emotionally and intellectually challenging to engage with. I will flag especially graphic or intense content, and will do my best to make this class a space where we can engage empathetically and thoughtfully with difficult content.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve done my best to identify any texts with potentially triggering content. I’ve included tags for: violence, racism, misogyny, and self-harm. If you have concerns about encountering anything specific in the course material that I have not already tagged and would like me to provide warnings, please send me an email. Please feel free to discuss any concerns—including potential concerns about attending in-class discussions—with the instructor.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Point of View
 </h2>
 <p>
  The readings and my comments in class will suggest a particular point of view. This perspective is my own (or the author's) and does not have to be yours! I encourage you to disagree with the ideas in the readings and lectures as well as the perspectives of your colleagues in the course. A significant part of a college education is learning about the complexity of various issues. Therefore, it is important that we listen and respect one another, but we do not have to agree.

  Finally, students sometimes request re-grading of assignments. If a student wants an assignment re-graded by the instructors, that request must be submitted via email. However, a re-grade request makes the entire assignment possible to be re-assessed; therefore, it is theoretically possible that your overall grade could go
  <em>
   down
  </em>
  as a result of the request.
