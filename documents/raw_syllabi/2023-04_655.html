  <strong>
   Week 3:
  </strong>
  Write programs that use part of speech tagging, dependency parsing, and coreference models to extract simple information from a text corpus and analyze that information.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Week 4:
  </strong>
  Train a word sense disambiguation (WSD) system using classifiers, compare performances for unsupervised and supervised WSD systems, and, train a classifier to predict social/pragmatic information from text (e.g., sarcasm)
