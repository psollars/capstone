  Course Overview and Prerequisites
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course analyzes the motivations and incentives for people to contribute to public goods. Students will learn how to apply causal inference techniques and social science theories to nudge pro-social behavior. Application domains include energy conservation, safe driving, contributions to open content (Wikipedia), open source, and P2P online microfinance. This course was initially developed by Dr. Yan Chen. The syllabus and course design are thanks to her hard work and expertise.

  <strong>
   Data Problem Set Assignment 1
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Analysis of a data set from a field experiment using social information intervention to reduce traffic violations (Chen et al. 2017).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The data set contains the traffic violation record of 395,204 cars over a 10-month period in 2013 in Tsingtao, China. The researchers implemented their intervention at the end of the 9th month, and used the 10th month data for impact evaluation.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Techniques: Poisson regressions, clustering of standard errors
   </p>
  </li>

  <li>
   <p>
    The data set comes from a field experiment in the metro Atlanta area.

    Analysis of two Kiva data sets to practice the use of instrumental variable regressions.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The data sets for Ai et al. (2016) contains an intervention that evaluate the effects of team membership on prosocial lending. To argue for exclusion restriction, one needs to use the Chen et al. (2017) data set.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The data sets contain Kiva lending activities from two field experiments.
   </p>

  <li>
   <p>
    Techniques: Instrumental variable regressions, inclusion and exclusion restrictions

  Original Work Policy
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Collaboration
  </strong>
  : I strongly encourage collaboration while working on homework problems. Active learning is effective. Collaboration will be especially valuable in summarizing the reading materials and picking out the key concepts. You must, however, write your homework submission on your own, in your own words, before turning it in. If you work with someone on the homework before writing it, you must list any and all collaborators on your written submission.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Plagiarism
  </strong>
  : All written submissions must be your own, original work. Original work for narrative questions is not mere paraphrasing of someone else’s completed answer: you must not share written answers with each other at all. At most, you should be working from notes you took while participating in a study session. Largely duplicate copies of the same assignment will receive an equal division of the total point score from the one piece of work. You may incorporate selected excerpts from publications by other authors, but they must be clearly marked as quotations and must be attributed. If you build on the ideas of prior authors, you must cite their work. You may obtain copy editing assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others, but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own, or be explicitly attributed to another. See the

 <p>
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Letter Grades, Course Grades, and Late Submission Policy
 </h2>
 <p>
  If you are late submitting an assignment, the following late policy will typically apply: 15% reduction if assignment is turned in one day late, 30% reduction if two days late, 45% reduction if three days late, and a zero (0) if four or more days late.
