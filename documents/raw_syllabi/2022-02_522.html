   Course Overview and Prerequisites
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  This course will introduce information visualization — visual representations of data through interactive systems. Specific focus will be on the role of visualization in understanding data and understanding how perception, cognition, and good design enhance visualization. The course will introduce APIs for visualization construction. Students will learn to construct and critique visualizations and visualization tools.

Students should have an understanding of the pandas library, which is covered in Data Manipulation, prior to this course.

 <p>
  The preferred method for getting help in this course is to make a public post in the course slack. Often times the questions that you have will be shared by your fellow classmates. Asking in a public channel allows you to share information with each other and is also the fastest route to get help from the instructional team. If you have a specific question that you feel can't be answered in the public slack, you are welcome to DM the instructional team. If you do so please address your DM to the entire instructional team.

   Special Note 1 - Autograder:
  </strong>
  All assignments in this course are manually graded. There are no auto graded assignments in this course and submitting to the autograder will give you an error (it will also not be considered a submission for grading purposes).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Special Note 2 - Assignment submission:
  </strong>
  You will be submitting your assignment in two ways: a link to your notebook (use the special "generate link" per the instructions; and a PDF. You will not be able to run the notebook submitted through this link (it is a read-only environment), but it will work for us.  If it worked for you in your regular environment, it will work for us.
 </p>
 <p>
  To print the visualizations in your Jupyter notebook to PDF, please highlight any word at the bottom of your notebook and then print to PDF in your browser. It's a bit of a hack, but an unfortunate result of an IFRAME issue in Jupyter. You can see a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiO-K7AoWjk" title="Video walkthrough for printing">
   video walkthrough of this here
  </a>
  . Please check your pdf and see if the visualizations have rendered before submitting, and please ask for help in Slack if you are having difficulty with this.

  We also encourage you to support your classmates, but again, without sharing completed code (pointing to resources, describing ideas in pseudo-code, etc. is fine).
