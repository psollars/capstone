  Academic Integrity/Code of Conduct
 </h1>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3bold">
  Collaboration
 </h3>
 <p>
  UMSI strongly encourages collaboration while working on some assignments, such as homework problems and interpreting reading assignments as a general practice. Active learning is effective. Collaboration with other students in the course will be especially valuable in summarizing the reading materials and picking out the key concepts. You must, however, write your homework submission on your own, in your own words, before turning it in. If you worked with someone on the homework before writing it, you must list any and all collaborators on your written submission. Each course and each instructor may place restrictions on collaboration for any or all assignments. Read the instructions carefully and request clarification about collaboration when in doubt. Collaboration is almost always forbidden for take-home and in class exams.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are a more advanced student and are willing to help other students, please feel free to do so. Just remember that your goal is to help teach the material to the student receiving the help and not do their work for them.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3bold">
  Plagiarism
 </h3>
 <p>
  All written submissions must be your own, original work. Original work for narrative questions is not mere paraphrasing of someone else’s completed answer: you must not share written answers with each other at all. At most, you should be working from notes you took while participating in a study session. Largely duplicate copies of the same assignment will receive an equal division of the total point score from the one piece of work.
 </p>
 <p>
  You may incorporate selected excerpts, statements or phrases from publications by other authors, but they must be clearly marked as quotations and must be attributed. If you build on the ideas of prior authors, you must cite their work. You may obtain copy editing assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others, but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own, or be explicitly attributed to another. See the (Doctoral, MSI, BSI) student handbooks available on the UMSI intranet for the definition of plagiarism, resources to help you avoid it, and the consequences for intentional or unintentional plagiarism.

 <p>
  Students may experience stressors that can impact both their academic experience and their personal well-being. These may include academic pressure and challenges associated with relationships, mental health, alcohol or other drugs, identities, finances, etc. If you are experiencing concerns, seeking help is a courageous thing to do for yourself and those who care about you. If the source of your stressors is academic, please contact Anthony so that he can find solutions together. For personal concerns, U-M offers the following resources:

  Disability statement
 </h1>
 <p>
  The University of Michigan recognizes disability as an integral part of diversity and is committed to creating an inclusive and equitable educational environment for students with disabilities. Students who are experiencing a disability-related barrier should contact Services for
  <a href="https://ssd.umich.edu/" title="">
   Students with Disabilities
  </a>
  ; 734-763-3000 or
  <a href="mailto:ssdoffice@umich.edu" title="">

  </a>
  ). For students who are connected with SSD, accommodation requests can be made in Accommodate. If you have any questions or concerns please contact your SSD Coordinator or visit SSD’s Current Student webpage. SSD considers aspects of the course design, course learning objects and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SSD, instructors, and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience. The instructional team will treat any information that you provide in as confidential a manner as possible.

  Technology Tips

 <p>
  We will be using Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, and Google Sheets to facilitate communication. The comprehensive oral exam will be conducted using Zoom, and the team project will be Python-based and Jupyter notebook-based.

 <p>
  This course differs from your other MADS courses in many ways including technology.  We have created a Jupyter environment for you that is functionally equivalent to SIADS 516, which is a superset of the base MADS environment. You can access that environment via the "ungraded lab assignment" in Coursera.  You can use that environment or choose to use any of the environments from courses you have already completed.  Alternatively, you can use your own locally installed environment.  Another possibility is to use
