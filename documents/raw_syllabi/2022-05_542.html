  Course Overview
 </h1>
 <p>
  Students will learn how to correctly apply, interpret results, and iteratively refine and tune supervised machine learning models to solve a diverse set of problems on real-world datasets. Application is emphasized over theoretical content. The supervised learning course is an essential part of the core MADS machine learning series: its concepts, algorithms, and evaluation methods are used heavily throughout the following machine learning courses that include: unsupervised learning, deep learning, and machine learning pipelines.
 </p>
 <p>
  <u>
   Note
  </u>
  : This course is based on material that also appears in the Supervised Machine Learning course in the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization on Coursera.  A number of the weekly assessments are different in the MADS version, but some overlap may remain in a few cases (e.g. final week). If you've already taken the Specialization version of this course, please contact the instructor if you would like the option of doing an alternate assignment for week 4.  The Enrichment Lectures for this course will also cover additional topics not available in the Specialization.
 </p>
 <h1 level="1">
  Prerequisites

This week’s assignment has a refresher on data manipulation with numpy in part 1. Then in part 2, you work through the process of loading and examining a dataset, training a k-nearest neighbors classifier on the dataset, and then evaluating the accuracy of the classifier and using it to classify new data.

  Grading and Course Checklist
 </h1>
 <p>
  I anticipate no major changes to this course grading scheme. However, as the course progresses, I reserve the right to offer additional bonus assessments or make minor adjustments/fixes as required, for any evaluation method in this course.  If necessary, any such changes will always be done in a way that maximizes a student's grade across options.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3semibold">
  Given the highly interdependent nature of MADS courses, it is essential that you properly cover
  <u>
   all
  </u>
  the topics in this course, each of which is important.  Thus, you
  <u>
   must "pass" all assignments and quizzes to get credit for this course.
  </u>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  What does this mean?  You "pass" an assignment or quiz by getting a minimum grade of 80% regardless of whatever late penalty might also apply.  If by the end of the course you have any assignments or quizzes that you did not "pass", you will be given a course grade of "incomplete" until you submit those remaining assignments or quizzes to the level of a  "pass".
 </h3>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3semibold">
  Example: You hand in Assignment 3 but only get a grade of 60%, which is less than 80% and thus not a "pass". You continue in the course, and to meet the above "pass" course requirement, a week later you finish the questions and achieve a score of 90% (ignoring late penalty) for Assignment 3.  Thus, you now have a "pass" for Assignment 3. Your actual grade for Assignment 3 will be evaluated by the normal grading / late penalty scheme. In this case, it will be 60% (the maximum of your submission grades with late penalty included), not the 90% grade used to satisfy the "pass" criterion (which ignores the late penalty).

  Late Submission Policy
 </h1>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Important! Please read and understand this section, and if anything is unclear, the instructors are happy to clarify.
  </strong>
  We realize that, now more than ever,  the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra time in completing a course assignment or quiz. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy that gives you a limited number of flexible "late day" credits.
 </p>
 <p>
  You have
  <strong>
   a total of two (2) free late days
  </strong>
  to use during the course. One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. As an example, suppose you had two course late days left. Submitting any time within 24hrs of the original due date counts as using the first late day. Beyond that time, submitting any time within the next 24h counts as using the 2nd late day. After that, each additional 24h period accrues a 25% per day penalty as follows:
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you have used up your late days, there is a 25% penalty for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late. For example, if the due date is 11:59pm Monday, and you have *no* late days left, penalties would be:
 </p>
 <p>
  Submit before 11:59pm EDT Tuesday: 	25% deduction
 </p>
 <p>
  Submit before 11:59pm EDT Wednesday: 50% deduction
 </p>
 <p>
  Submit before 11:59pm EDT Thursday:  75% deduction
 </p>
 <p>
  Submit after 11:59pm EDT Thursday: 	100% deduction
 </p>
 <p>
  If you were to have
  <strong>
   one late day
  </strong>
  at the end of the term the submission policy would be as follows:
 </p>
 <p>
  Submit before 11:59pm EDT Wednesday: 25% deduction
 </p>
 <p>
  Submit before 11:59pm EDT Thursday:  50% deduction
 </p>
 <p>
  ... and so on as above.
 </p>
 <p>
  You don't need to explain or get permission to use late days, and we will track them for you. We will allocate any late days you have used at the end of the course, after all assignments are submitted, so that we can do the allocation in a way that maximizes your final grade. Note that resubmissions after the deadline will be counted as late submissions.
  <strong>
   This late policy applies to both assignments
  </strong>
  <strong>
   <u>
    and
   </u>
  </strong>
  <strong>
   quizzes
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note:  Submitting your work on time is very important in this course.  Do not leave the assignments for the last minute. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to stay on track, though the instructional team may reach out to you and ask you about your progress; if you fall behind it may be difficult to catch up, and you will be at risk for not succeeding in the course.

  Technology Tips
 </h1>
 <p>
  We will be using Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, and Google Sheets to facilitate communication. Your own work on the project will be done in Jupyter.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have created a Jupyter environment for you that is functionally equivalent to SIADS 516, which is a superset of the base MADS environment. You can access that environment via the "ungraded lab assignment" in Coursera.  You can use that environment or choose to use any of the environments from courses you have already completed.  Alternatively, you can use your own locally installed environment.  Another possibility is to use
  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb" title="">
   <u>
    Google Colaboratory
   </u>
  </a>
  , which may facilitate collaboration.

  Working Offline
 </h1>
 <p>
  While the Coursera platform has an integrated Jupyter Notebook system, you can work offline on your own computer by installing Python 3.5+ and the Jupyter software packages. For more details, consult the
