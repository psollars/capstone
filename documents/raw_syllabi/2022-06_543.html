  Course Overview
 </h1>
 <p>
  Unsupervised learning algorithms are methods for transforming and finding structure in datasets without the benefit of labeled examples to guide them. Students will learn how to correctly apply, interpret results, and iteratively refine and tune unsupervised machine learning models to solve a diverse set of problems on real-world datasets. Application is emphasized over theoretical content. The unsupervised learning course is an essential part of the core MADS machine learning series: its concepts, algorithms, and evaluation methods are used heavily throughout the following machine learning courses that include: deep learning and machine learning pipelines.

  Schedule
 </h1>
 <p>
  <u>
   <strong>
    Please note
   </strong>
  </u>
  <strong>
   : in order to provide a self-contained module for some topics (e.g. where it's easy to move back and forth for reference if needed), a few videos turned out to be significantly longer than average. Also, in contrast to supervised learning, the unsupervised learning course covers more material in the first week than the supervised learning course did, so please plan your schedule accordingly.  Unlike in supervised learning where the first assignment was shorter and given less weight, all four assignments in unsupervised learning have *equal* weight.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <u>
    Week 1
   </u>
  </strong>
  : You'll be introduced to basic unsupervised learning methods that focus on transformation of data: dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, and density estimation, with analysis of realistic datasets, implemented using the scikit-learn library. For this week's assignment you'll apply Principal Components Analysis to gain insight into a large real-world dataset, use manifold learning methods such as t-SNE to visualize complex structure, and use kernel density estimation to estimate probabilities of conditional events.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <u>
    Week 2
   </u>
  </strong>
  : This week will focus entirely on clustering - another critical and widely-used unsupervised learning method. You'll learn about the most important families of clustering algorithms: hierarchical methods (agglomerative bottom-up, divisive top-down), partitioning methods (k-means, k-medoids) and density-based methods (DBSCAN). You'll also gain awareness of more advanced methods such as spectral clustering, and how to evaluate cluster quality. This week's assignment will have you apply a variety of these clustering approaches to realistic datasets using scikit-learn's clustering capabilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <u>
    Week 3:
   </u>
  </strong>
  Our theme this week is estimating latent variables, another important area of unsupervised learning, especially for text-based applications. We'll cover the EM algorithm for estimating latent variables and its connection with k-means clustering. Topic modeling is another form of latent variable estimation and you'll learn about two different methods for this: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Indexing. We'll also survey word embeddings: learning how to represent words with vectors in semantically useful ways. This week's assignment will include problems that have you apply EM to a new scenario, analyze topic structure in a large document collection, and apply word embeddings to an NLP-related task.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <u>
    Week 4:
   </u>
  </strong>
  In the final week of this course, we'll see how unsupervised methods can be integrated with supervised learning methods to improve prediction performance. To do this, we’ll look at various special topics, including data imputation (dealing with missing data) and extensions of unsupervised learning that are at the cutting edge of today's technology: semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning. This week's assignment will be a synthesis project in which you apply unsupervised methods and supervised methods to a complex real-world dataset.

  Grading and Course Checklist
 </h1>
 <p>
  I anticipate no major changes to this course grading scheme. However, as the course progresses, I reserve the right to offer additional bonus assessments or make minor adjustments/fixes as required, for any evaluation method in this course.  If necessary, any such changes will always be done in a way that maximizes a student's grade across options.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3bold">
  Given the highly interdependent nature of MADS courses, it is essential that you properly cover
  <u>
   all
  </u>
  the topics in this course, each of which is important.  Thus, you
  <u>
   <em>
    must "pass" all assignments and quizzes to get credit for this course.
   </em>
  </u>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  What does this mean?  You "pass" an assignment or quiz by getting a minimum grade of 80% regardless of whatever late penalty might also apply.  If by the end of the course you have any assignments or quizzes that you did not "pass", you will be given a course grade of "incomplete" until you submit those remaining assignments or quizzes to the level of a  "pass".
 </h3>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3bold">
  Example: You hand in Assignment 3 but only get a grade of 60%, which is less than 80% and thus not a "pass". You continue in the course, and to meet the above "pass" course requirement, a week later you finish the questions and achieve a score of 90% (ignoring late penalty) for Assignment 3.  Thus, you now have a "pass" for Assignment 3. Your actual grade for Assignment 3 will be evaluated by the normal grading / late penalty scheme. In this case, it will be 60% (the maximum of your submission grades with late penalty included), not the 90% grade used to satisfy the "pass" criterion (which ignores the late penalty).

  Late Submission Policy
 </h1>
 <p>
  We realize that, now more than ever,  the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra time in completing a course assignment. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy that gives you a limited number of flexible "late day" credits.
 </p>
 <p>
  You have two (2) free late days to use during the entire course (*not* per week or per assignment). One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. You don't need to explain or get permission to use late days, and
  <strong>
   we will track them for you and apply those free late  days at the end of the course
  </strong>
  . Note that resubmissions after the deadline will be counted as late submissions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you have used up your late days, a 25% penalty (the same as SIADS-542) will be applied for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Please note:
  </strong>
  Submitting your work on time is very important in this course.  The instructional team will periodically reach out to you and ask you about your progress; if you fall behind it may be difficult to catch up, and you will be at risk for not succeeding in the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Also note:
  </strong>
  All assignments for this course are due on Mondays at
  <strong>
   11:59 p.m. EDT.
  </strong>

  Technology Tips
 </h1>
 <p>
  We will be using Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, and Google Sheets to facilitate communication. Your own work on the project will be done in Jupyter.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have created a Jupyter environment for you that is functionally equivalent to SIADS 516, which is a superset of the base MADS environment. You can access that environment via the "ungraded lab assignment" in Coursera.  You can use that environment or choose to use any of the environments from courses you have already completed.  Alternatively, you can use your own locally installed environment.  Another possibility is to use
  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb" title="">
   <u>
    Google Colaboratory
   </u>
  </a>
  , which may facilitate collaboration.

  Working Offline
 </h1>
 <p>
  While the Coursera platform has an integrated Jupyter Notebook system, you can work offline on your own computer by installing Python 3.5+ and the Jupyter software packages. For more details, consult the
