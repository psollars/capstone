  Course Overview and Prerequisites
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course will introduce basic concepts of causal inference. The experimental ideal, that is, random assignment of the treatment, is often impossible or impractical. Thus, we must look for alternative strategies that allow for causal identification when we do not have control over treatment assignment. In this course, we will explore the five most common methods to identify causal effects in observational data. This includes controlled regression, matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and differences-in-differences. The aim is to help you to understand modern applied econometric methods and to foster the skills needed to plan and conduct your own data science projects.

Course prerequisites: Students should have completed at least one undergraduate statistics class at the level of Stats 250. Please note by completing the Statistics Entrance assessment, you have waived this prerequisite.

This course was initially developed by Dr. Alain Cohn. The syllabus and course design are thanks to his hard work and expertise.

   Late policy
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  For this course, the late-submission policy is 15% daily-recurring reduction in grade for the first three days after the submission deadline. You will receive a zero (0) if your assignment is turned in four or more days late.
 </p>
 <p>
  Students have one free pass to submit all of one week's assessments late (up to three days).  Students don't need to explain their circumstances but need to report their late submission by DMing Instructional team. Instructional team will adjust the late grade for one week's assessments.

 </p>
 <p>
  While we offer a number of discussion channels to support your work, if you are stuck you may not share or receive complete solutions to the assignments. We also encourage you to support your classmates, but again, without sharing completed code (pointing to resources, describing ideas in pseudo-code, etc. is fine).
