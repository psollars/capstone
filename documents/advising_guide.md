## Academic Advising Frequently Asked Questions Master Of Applied Data Science Program

# General Academic Advising

## Q: What is the best way to contact the MADS advising team?

A: The best way to contact the MADS advising office is by emailing [umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu)

## Q: What can my academic advisor help me with?

A: Academic advisors are available to assist you with academic planning and course selection. Advisors also provide support to students experiencing academic difficulties, unanticipated emergency situations, and health or personal issues. The advising team can also help review academic policies and procedures with you. They are available to meet with you to discuss any issue impacting your academic experience at UMSI.

## Q: Can you advise me on which courses are the heaviest workload, the most difficult, etc?

A: Each student brings a variety of skills and background knowledge to the program that influences their learning experience in each course. We encourage students to reach out to classmates via Slack to inquire about workload and difficulty from the viewpoint of a peer. Additionally, students [can view class syllabi here](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-applied-data-science-online/curriculum/mads-courses) to review course descriptions and sample syllabi from past semesters. Students can also utilize [Atlas](https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/), which is another tool students can use to schedule classes and review historic data on courses.

## Q: How should I prepare for my advising appointment?

A: Your advising appointment is an opportunity to reflect on and engage in academic planning consistent with your personal and professional goals. You will be expected to come prepared to most appointments and your preparation may include:

- Review your Online Degree Audit Report and Unofficial Transcript in [Wolverine Access](https://wolverineaccess.umich.edu/)
- Referencing the [MADS Degree Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mTgmzn42DYNm6G1DPvfVN7oLK5ADLxFWXliIW4aqTNQ/edit?usp=sharing), [Sample Course Plans,](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7XsNvPS58FFRjejP28BT1wrfBz2GVYub6rtBFv09Xc/edit?usp=sharing) and [Student Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEOcpdONdme5kmpNEnZpdbJeVFhEIw1pS0wq16QdH1I/edit?usp=sharing) familiarize yourself with current policies, procedures, and resources
- Downloading and completing any academic forms that need a signature from your academic unit
- Preparing a list of questions you would like to ask

## Q: What is the difference between academic advising and career advising/coaching?

A: Academic Advising can discuss any issue impacting your academic experience at UMSI. This could include academic planning, concerns relating to a particular course, academic policies, connecting you to campus resources, and course selection. Career advising focuses more on internship opportunities, searching for a job, networking, interview practice, resume/cover letter reviews, and all things relating to the job search.

## Q: How do I schedule an advising appointment?

A: At this time, appointments can be scheduled via [UMSI CareerLink.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_Z5Js4Kth9Rk5KWLlFuri_sds-2dy5g3nja1g2JZNg/edit?usp=sharing)

## Q: How long do I have to complete the program?

A: Per the [MADS Student Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEOcpdONdme5kmpNEnZpdbJeVFhEIw1pS0wq16QdH1I/edit?usp=sharing), "students are expected to complete all coursework within five years from the date of first enrollment in the program. Students exceeding this time limit must file a petition for modification or waiver of policy. Petitions must describe explicitly the amount of work remaining and a timeline for completion. Students must be making good progress and have good academic standing to receive an extension. A student who does not complete degree requirements within five years and does not petition for an extension may be withdrawn from the program and required to apply for readmission".

## Q: Where do I go for additional information on advising and registration?

A: For additional information regarding advising, please refer back to your Coursera Orientation materials. This is an ample resource regarding policies, academic planning, contact information and more!

# Course Planning

## Q: What is the recommended number of credits students should take?

A: The MADS Program allows ample flexibility to meet the needs of students. The Advising Team recommends that students consider their own professional and personal responsibilities as they plan their academic journey. Please refer to the [MADS Degree Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mTgmzn42DYNm6G1DPvfVN7oLK5ADLxFWXliIW4aqTNQ/edit?usp=sharing) and [Sample Course Plans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7XsNvPS58FFRjejP28BT1wrfBz2GVYub6rtBFv09Xc/edit?usp=sharing) documents to further assist you in your academic planning.

## Q: How are the MADS courses/semesters set up?

A: The MADS calendar year is divided into three semesters - Fall (August-December), Winter (January-April), and Spring/Summer Semesters (May-August). The MADS semesters are broken down into 4 Sessions within each semester. Each Session is roughly a month long. Each course lasts for one Session and is one credit hour (with the exception of SIADS 699: Capstone, which is 3 semester hours and spans across Sessions 2-4 and SIADS 593: Milestone I and SIADS 696: Milestone II, which are two credits and run over sessions 1-2). Please view the [Sample Plans of Academic Study Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7XsNvPS58FFRjejP28BT1wrfBz2GVYub6rtBFv09Xc/edit?usp=sharing) to get a visual of the semester/ session structure. Additionally, you can view the [MADS academic calendar here](https://www.si.umich.edu/current-students/mads-calendars).

## Q: What is the difference between "Months" and "Sessions"?

A: "Months" and "Sessions" are terms used interchangeably to describe the nature of MADS courses. For example, SIADS 505 is offered in Month One, or in other words, SIADS 505 is offered in Session 1.

## Q: Where can I find the MADS Academic Calendar and Important Dates?

A: The MADS Academic Calendars can be found on the UMSI website [HERE](https://www.si.umich.edu/current-students/mads-calendars). You can also add the Google Calendar, "MADS Academic Calendar" to your Google Calendar to keep up to date with important dates and MADS academic events.

## Q: When will courses be offered next?

A: Each course is offered once each semester. Courses are always offered in the same session each semester. Please view the [MADS Course Offerings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jqVS139xChUEq9uNi-WztjwWGzAMYOPk8WtvKJEm_D0/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet for the most up-to-date information.

## Q: How do I know what Session a certain course will be offered?

A: Courses are offered in the same Session each semester, starting in the Fall 2021 semester. Please view the [MADS Course Offerings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jqVS139xChUEq9uNi-WztjwWGzAMYOPk8WtvKJEm_D0/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet for the most up-to-date information.

If courses are not going to be offered in their typical session, the MADS Academic Advising team will alert students in a timely manner to plan accordingly.

## Q: I want to take off a session for work, travel, personal responsibilities, etc. Am I able to do that?

A: You may take off a Session during the semester. Some things to keep in mind are the add/drop deadlines and that classes are only offered once per semester. Therefore, if you take off a session, you will not be able to take that class until the next semester when it is offered again. Additionally, many classes have required pre-reqs, so we encourage students to contact [umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu) to discuss what impact this may have on your plan of study. For more information about what session a class is offered, prerequisite information, and course descriptions, view the [MADS Course Offerings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jqVS139xChUEq9uNi-WztjwWGzAMYOPk8WtvKJEm_D0/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet for the most up-to-date information.

## Q: I want to take off an extended period of time off or Leave of Absence (ex: multiple semesters) for work, travel, personal responsibilities, etc. Am I able to do that?

A: If you decide to take a leave of absence and have not yet used the online course registration, you do not need to submit any paperwork, but should notify the MADS Academic Advising Team at [umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu) of your intentions. If you have already registered, you will need to submit a term withdrawal form to drop all your classes for the semester. For questions, regarding the term withdrawal process, please email [umsi.registrar@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.registrar@umich.edu).

To register for classes following a term in which you were not enrolled, you will need to contact the Office of the Registrar by email at [ro.registration.questions@umich.edu](mailto:ro.registration.questions@umich.edu), or phone 734.764.6280 / 734.647.3507, to request a registration appointment assignment. If using email, please include name, UM ID number, term, and school or college in which you wish to register.

Students not enrolling within a year (12 months) will have to apply for readmission to UMSI.

# Class Registration

## Q: What is a Backpack?

A: The Backpack is a feature available on [Wolverine Access](https://wolverineaccess.umich.edu/) that works much like the "shopping carts" you have seen on many retail websites. With the Backpack you can prepare for your upcoming registration appointment by filling it with classes you want to take. When it is time to register, you will select one or more classes from your Backpack to register for it. NOTE: Placing a class in your Backpack does not enroll you in that class. You must register for a class to become enrolled in it.

A: Students should register for at least one credit the day before the semester begins to avoid obtaining a late registration fee. However, it typically takes 48-72 hours for courses to show up in Coursera after completing registration on Wolverine Access, so it is preferable to complete registration before the deadline. In addition, early registration benefits students by planning out your semester and helps administrators ensure that there is appropriate staffing given enrollment numbers.

## Q: How do I add a course after the drop/add deadline?

A: Adding classes after the drop/add deadline requires an [online](https://csprod.dsc.umich.edu/htmldoc/eng/dftie/lsaa/htm/sr_ss_latedropaddform.html) late add request in [Wolverine Access.](https://wolverineaccess.umich.edu/) If you add a course late and it is approved, please be sure to connect with the instructor to catch up on any missing work.

If you register for classes within one week before the session starts or after the session starts, you may not have access to course materials on the first day of classes. It typically takes 48-72 hours for your courses to upload to Coursera after registering in Wolverine Access. Because of the turnaround time, we recommend that students register at least a week before the start of a session. If it takes longer than 4 days to gain access in Coursera once the session begins, please contact [umsimadshelp@umich.edu](mailto:umsimadshelp@umich.edu).

## Q: Where can I find grades in Wolverine Access?

A: Grades can be found in the Academic Records tab located in [Wolverine Access](https://wolverineaccess.umich.edu/).

1. Login to your Wolverine Access account with your uniqname and password
2. Under the "Students" tab, select "Student Business"

## Q: How do I request my official transcript?

A: Detailed instructions about [ordering an official transcript can be found here](https://ro.umich.edu/records-registration/transcripts).

## Q: What is the minimum GPA requirement for MADS students?

A: To earn a Master of Applied Data Science degree from the University of Michigan School of Information, you must complete a minimum of 34 hours of graduate coursework, with a minimum cumulative grade average of B and a minimum grade of C- or greater in any course, including all required coursework.

Note that within the 34 hours of graduate coursework, all 34 credits must be coursework taken within UMSI (SIADS credit). Additionally, you must complete all Milestone and Capstone courses. Currently MADS does not accept transfer credit of any kind including credit earned from other academic programs or MOOC certificates.

## Q: How are courses graded?

A: The method of grading is the letter-grade system (A, B, C, D, E), except for special courses as noted. Courses in which D or E grades are earned do not count for degree credit. Grades of + and – may be given to graduate students whenever such fineness of discrimination is possible. Additionally, the [MADS Student Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEOcpdONdme5kmpNEnZpdbJeVFhEIw1pS0wq16QdH1I/edit?usp=sharing) is a great resource for further information about grading policies.

## Q: What is the lowest grade I can get in a course and still have it count for credit?

A: The minimum grade required for each course is a C-. Courses in which D or E grades are earned do not count for degree credit. Keep in mind, students must complete all graduate coursework with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 (B average) or higher.

## Q: What is the process for requesting an incomplete?

A: If a MADS student needs to drop a course, effort should be made to do so within the first week (or seven days) from when the course starts, before the MADS drop/add deadline. However, when extenuating circumstances prevent completion of coursework by the end of the MADS session, and the student participated in the course past the standard MADS drop/add deadline, a grade of incomplete ("I") may be assigned. An "I" can be changed to a letter grade only if the work is completed within one year (12 months) from the end of the term in which the course was started, regardless of the student’s subsequent enrollment status. A notation of "I" remaining on a student’s record more than one year (12 months) after the end of the term in which the "I" was posted becomes a permanent incomplete ("I") and credit can only be earned by retaking the course. An "I" is not calculated into the student’s term or cumulative GPA; the grade point average is based on credit hours of completed work.

To request a grade of incomplete ("I") in a course that has not been awarded a letter grade or course withdrawal (W), students must contact the MADS Academic Advising Team ([umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu](mailto:umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu)) as soon as possible, and no later than two business days (Eastern time) after the last day of the MADS session. Once contact is made, an academic advisor will partner with the student to create a plan for completion of the course, typically through placement and participation in a future session.

The MADS Academic Advising Team will notify the course instructor when a student’s request for an incomplete is approved so that an "I" can be submitted as the student’s final course grade.

# Tuition/Finances/Financial Aid

## Q: Who is the best contact for tuition and finance questions- deadlines, adjusted tuition amounts, payment plans, scholarships, etc.?
