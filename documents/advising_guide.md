A: The best way to contact the MADS advising office is by emailing umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu

## Q: What Can My Academic Advisor Help Me With?

## Q: Can You Advise Me On Which Courses Are The Heaviest Workload, The Most Difficult, Etc?

A: Each student brings a variety of skills and background knowledge to the program that influences their learning experience in each course. We encourage students to reach out to classmates via Slack to inquire about workload and difficulty from the viewpoint of a peer. Additionally, students can view class syllabi here to review course descriptions and sample syllabi from past semesters. Students can also utilize Atlas, which is another tool students can use to schedule classes and review historic data on courses.

## Q: What Is The Difference Between Academic Advising And Career Advising/Coaching?

A: Academic Advising can discuss any issue impacting your academic experience at UMSI. This could include academic planning, concerns relating to a particular course, academic policies, connecting you to campus resources, and course selection. Career advising focuses more on internship opportunities, searching for a job, networking, interview practice, resume/cover letter reviews, and all things relating to the job search.

## Q: How Do I Schedule An Advising Appointment?

A: At this time, appointments can be scheduled via UMSI CareerLink.

## Q: How Long Do I Have To Complete The Program?

A: Per the MADS Student Handbook, "students are expected to complete all coursework within five years from the date of first enrollment in the program. Students exceeding this time limit must file a petition for modification or waiver of policy. Petitions must describe explicitly the amount of work remaining and a timeline for completion. Students must be making good progress and have good academic standing to receive an extension. A student who does not complete degree requirements within five years and does not petition for an extension may be withdrawn from the program and required to apply for readmission".

Each course lasts for one Session and is one credit hour (with the exception of SIADS 699: Capstone, which is 3 semester hours and spans across Sessions 2-4 and SIADS 593: Milestone I and SIADS 696: Milestone II, which are two credits and run over sessions 1-2). Please view the Sample Plans of Academic Study Document to get a visual of the semester/ session structure. Additionally, you can view the MADS academic calendar here.

## Q: What Is The Difference Between "Months" And "Sessions"?

## Q: What Is The Minimum Gpa Requirement For Mads Students?

A: To earn a Master of Applied Data Science degree from the University of Michigan School of Information, you must complete a minimum of 34 hours of graduate coursework, with a minimum cumulative grade average of B and a minimum grade of C- or greater in any course, including all required coursework.

Note that within the 34 hours of graduate coursework, all 34 credits must be coursework taken within UMSI (SIADS credit). Additionally, you must complete all Milestone and Capstone courses. Currently MADS does not accept transfer credit of any kind including credit earned from other academic programs or MOOC certificates.

## Q: How Are Courses Graded?

A: The method of grading is the letter-grade system (A, B, C, D, E), except for special courses as noted. Courses in which D or E grades are earned do not count for degree credit. Grades of + and - may be given to graduate students whenever such fineness of discrimination is possible. Additionally, the MADS Student Handbook is a great resource for further information about grading policies.

## Q: What Is The Lowest Grade I Can Get In A Course And Still Have It Count For Credit?

A: The minimum grade required for each course is a C-. Courses in which D or E grades are earned do not count for degree credit. Keep in mind, students must complete all graduate coursework with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 (B average) or higher.

## Q: What Is The Process For Requesting An Incomplete?

A: If a MADS student needs to drop a course, effort should be made to do so within the first week (or seven days) from when the course starts, before the MADS drop/add deadline. However, when extenuating circumstances prevent completion of coursework by the end of the MADS session, and the student participated in the course past the standard MADS drop/add deadline, a grade of incomplete ("I") may be assigned. An "I" can be changed to a letter grade only if the work is completed within one year (12 months) from the end of the term in which the course was started, regardless of the student's subsequent enrollment status. A notation of "I" remaining on a student's record more than one year (12 months) after the end of the term in which the "I" was posted becomes a permanent incomplete ("I") and credit can only be earned by retaking the course. An "I" is not calculated into the student's term or cumulative GPA; the grade point average is based on credit hours of completed work.

To request a grade of incomplete ("I") in a course that has not been awarded a letter grade or course withdrawal (W), students must contact the MADS Academic Advising Team (umsi.advising.mads@umich.edu) as soon as possible, and no later than two business days (Eastern time) after the last day of the MADS session. Once contact is made, an academic advisor will partner with the student to create a plan for completion of the course, typically through placement and participation in a future session.

The MADS Academic Advising Team will notify the course instructor when a student's request for an incomplete is approved so that an "I" can be submitted as the student's final course grade.
