We know that MADS students come from a wide range of backgrounds and that use of others' work may be OK in some situations (like a course that encourages you to build on existing code libraries) and not in others (creating reports for this class). The course is designed to provide a wide variety of pathways and scenarios so as to minimize similarity between assignments. You must, however, create original work by yourself. Original work is not mere paraphrasing of someone else's completed answer or substituting words from existing text. Your work should have a strong sense of unique thinking; that is, it should transcend merely stringing together sentences and thoughts expressed by others, and your own synthesis should be evident in your work. Said differently, we are looking for your perspective and decision-making, supported by evidence you gather (and cite) from others. You may trace existing visualizations if you acknowledge the source graphic in your citations. All written submissions must be your own, original work.",

If you build on the ideas of prior authors, you must cite their work.\n\nYou may obtain copyediting assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others, but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own, or be explicitly attributed to another. Please cite your work using a recognizable citation format of your choice (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago, Turabian, etc.).

  "Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Schedule: Please note: in order to provide a self-contained module for some topics (e.g. where it's easy to move back and forth for reference if needed), a few videos turned out to be significantly longer than average. Also, in contrast to supervised learning, the unsupervised learning course covers more material in the first week than the supervised learning course did, so please plan your schedule accordingly. Unlike in supervised learning where the first assignment was shorter and given less weight, all four assignments in unsupervised learning have _equal_ weight.",
  "Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Schedule: Week 1: Week 1: You'll be introduced to basic unsupervised learning methods that focus on transformation of data: dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, and density estimation, with analysis of realistic datasets, implemented using the SciKit-Learn library. For this week's assignment you'll apply Principal Components Analysis to gain insight into a large real-world dataset, use manifold learning methods such as t-SNE to visualize complex structure, and use kernel density estimation to estimate probabilities of conditional events.

  "Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Schedule: Week 2: Week 2: This week will focus entirely on clustering - another critical and widely-used unsupervised learning method. You'll learn about the most important families of clustering algorithms: hierarchical methods (agglomerative bottom-up, divisive top-down), partitioning methods (k-means, k-medoids) and density-based methods (DBSCAN). You'll also gain awareness of more advanced methods such as spectral clustering, and how to evaluate cluster quality. This week's assignment will have you apply a variety of these clustering approaches to realistic datasets using SciKit-Learn clustering functionality. Required reading: Section 3.5: Clustering (all sections); You will also need to understand the basics of how to represent text data as a \"bag of words\" vector both this week and next week by reading Section 7.3: Representing Text Data as a Bag-of-Words, Section 7.4: Stopwords, and Section 7.5: Rescaling the Data with tfidf.",
  "Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Schedule: Week 3: Week 3: Our theme this week is estimating latent variables, another important area of unsupervised learning, especially for text-based applications. We'll cover the EM algorithm for estimating latent variables and its connection with k-means clustering. Topic modeling is another form of latent variable estimation and you'll learn about two different methods for this: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Indexing. We'll also survey word embeddings: learning how to represent words with vectors in semantically useful ways. This week's assignment will include problems that have you apply EM to a new scenario, analyze topic structure in a large document collection, and apply word embeddings to an NLP-related task. Required reading: Chapter 7: Working with Text (all sections)",
  "Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Schedule: Week 4: Week 4: In the final week of this course, we'll see how unsupervised methods can be integrated with supervised learning methods to improve prediction performance. To do this, we'll look at various special topics, including data imputation (dealing with missing data) and extensions of unsupervised learning that are at the cutting edge of today's technology: semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning. This week's assignment will be a synthesis project in which you apply unsupervised methods and supervised methods to a complex real-world dataset. Required reading: No textbook readings for this week, but you should should review the user guide, class documentation, and associated code examples for the following scikit-learn classes: 1. Label propagation (semi-supervised learning). User guide: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/semi_supervised.html#label-propagation 2. Data imputation.

  "Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Grading And Course Checklist: I anticipate no major changes to this course grading scheme. However, as the course progresses, I reserve the right to offer additional bonus assessments or make minor adjustments/fixes as required, for any evaluation method in this course. If necessary, any such changes will always be done in a way that maximizes a student's grade across options.",
  "Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Grading And Course Checklist: Given the highly interdependent nature of MADS courses, it is essential that you properly cover all the topics in this course, each of which is important. Thus, you must \"pass\" ALL Assignments AND Quizzes to receive credit for this course. What does this mean? You \"pass\" an assignment or quiz by getting a minimum grade of 80% regardless of whatever late penalty might also apply. If by the end of the course you have any assignments or quizzes that you did not \"pass\", you will be given a course grade of \"incomplete\" until you submit those remaining assignments or quizzes to the level of a \"pass\". Example: You hand in Assignment 3 but only get a grade of 60%, which is less than 80% and thus not a \"pass\". You continue in the course, and to meet the above \"pass\" course requirement, a week later you finish the questions and achieve a score of 90% (ignoring late penalty) for Assignment 3. Thus, you now have a \"pass\" for Assignment 3. Your actual grade for Assignment 3 will be evaluated by the normal grading / late penalty scheme. In this case, it will be 60% (the maximum of your submission grades with late penalty included), not the 90% grade used to satisfy the \"pass\" criterion (which ignores the late penalty).\n\n| Course Item                        | Percentage of Final Grade | Passing Threshold |\n| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| Week 1 Quiz                        | 5%                        | 80%               |",

  "Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Late Submission Policy: Important! Please read and understand this section, and if anything is unclear, the instructors are happy to clarify. We realize that, now more than ever, the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra time in completing a course assignment or quiz. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy that gives you a limited number of flexible \"late day\" credits. You have a total of two (2) free late days to use during the course. One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. As an example, suppose you had two course late days left. Submitting any time within 24hrs of the original due date counts as using the first late day. Beyond that time, submitting any time within the next 24h counts as using the 2nd late day. After that, each additional 24h period accrues a 25% per day penalty as follows: Once you have used up your late days, there is a 25% penalty for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late. For example, if the due date is 11:59 p.m. ET, Monday, and you have _no_ late days left, penalties would be: Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Tuesday: 25% deduction Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday: 50% deduction Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 75% deduction Submit after 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 100% deduction If you were to have one late day at the end of the term the submission policy would be as follows: Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday: 25% deduction Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 50% deduction ... and so on as above. Important: You do not need to explain or get permission to use late days. If you choose/need to use the available late days for a week's work, you will be responsible for designating which week(s) you wish to have the late day(s) applied. Your choice could impact your final course grade due to the assignment weighting described in the Grading and Course Checklist section above.",
  "Your choice could impact your final course grade due to the assignment weighting described in the Grading and Course Checklist section above. Upon completion of all assignments, please _Slack DM the course Instructor and Lecturer(s)_ (combined message) with your desired application of late days. Note that any submissions after the weekly deadline may be counted as a late submission for the week. This late policy applies to both assignments and quizzes .",
  "Unsupervised Learning (SIADS 543), Late Submission Policy: \nVery Important: If you intend to work on and submit an assignment after the official last day of the course (e.g. you use late days to complete a week 4 assignment past the deadline), you must make sure to start your work early enough that any assistance you might need from the instructional team can be obtained no later than the last official day of the course (i.e. stated close of the session). There is no guarantee that assistance from instructional staff will still be available after the last day of the course, since their time will already be occupied preparing for the next session's courses.\n\nPlease note: Submitting your work on time is very important in this course. Do not leave the assignments for the last minute. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to stay on track, though the instructional team may reach out to you and ask you about your progress; if you fall behind it may be difficult to catch up, and you will be at risk for not succeeding in the course. Start early, finish on time! Also note: Each week's assignments for this course are due on Monday at 11:59 p.m. ET.",

  "Data Science Ethics (SIADS 503), I. Course Basics Course Overview And Prerequisites: This class will teach you to recognize where ethical issues can arise when applying data science to real world problems. It will bring more analytic precision to ethical debates about the role that data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence play in consequential decision-making in commerce, employment, finance, healthcare, education, policing, and other areas. Largely through discussions of case studies, we will focus on ways to conceptualize, measure, and mitigate harm in data-driven decision-making. You will learn to think critically about how to plan and evaluate a data science project with ethical concerns in mind, and how to cope with novel challenges for which there are often no easy answers or established solutions.\n\nTo do so, you will learn key technical, ethical, policy, and legal terms and concepts that are relevant to ethical assessment in data science; learn about some of the common approaches and emerging tools for mitigating or managing these ethical concerns; and gain exposure to readings that will help you understand the current ethical and regulatory environment and to anticipate future developments. Ultimately, the class will teach you how to reason through these problems in a systematic manner and how to justify and defend your approach to dealing with them.\n\nThe prerequisites for this course are admission into the Masters in Applied Data Science program and successful completion of SIADS 501, \"Being a Data Scientist.\"",

  "Data Science Ethics (SIADS 503), Course Structure: Each week, this course consists of recorded lectures, required and recommended readings , and two office hours produced by the teaching team. Lectures consist of overview material about concepts as well as the discussion of case studies. In addition, a guest speaker will visit or we will take a field trip. This will provide one or more additional recorded lectures, interviews, or conversations. Lectures supplement but do not always review or duplicate the readings; readings supplement but do not always duplicate the lectures. That means some of the course content is available only from a lecture or a reading. For instance a concept may not be mentioned in a lecture, but it may be the key point of a reading. Students are still responsible for that material.\n\nA low-stakes, open-book weekly quiz will provide an incentive to keep up with the readings/lecture content. The primary work of the course is one writing assignment each week.\n\nOffice hours offer us the opportunity for the teaching team and students to discuss course topics more informally; there will be opportunities for both student-generated questions and conversation as well as teaching-team led presentations of content related to both course topics and assignments. We also hope to welcome some guests to shed light on how ethics issues manifest in real-life professional situations.\n\nSpecific information for each week is below in Course Schedule (section II).",

For example, if the due date is 11:59pm Monday, late penalties would be as follows. Submitted any time before 11:59pm Tuesday: 25% deduction Submitted any time before 11:59pm Wednesday 50% deduction Submitted any time before11:59pm Thursday: 75% deduction Submitted after 11:59pm Friday: 100% deduction Note that resubmissions after the deadline will be counted as late submissions. All items that are required must still be handed in, even if the late penalty would result in a grade of zero for that item. We have a strict policy that no waivers or extensions will be considered for any deadline except in the case of a documented emergency, so please do not send inquiries about extensions unless you have a documented emergency. This policy applies to all graded items (even those that are low stakes), including the final project. Please note: Submitting your work on time is very important in this course: there are important dependencies between some items, e.g. peer feedback must be on time in order to give teams enough time to incorporate changes for the final revision. Also, it is important to check in regularly with your project coach on team progress: if you fall behind in your project work your team will likely be overwhelmed and you will be at risk for not succeeding in the course.

  "Causal Inference (SIADS 630), SIADS 630 Syllabus Course Overview And Prerequisites: This course will introduce basic concepts of causal inference. The experimental ideal, that is, random assignment of the treatment, is often impossible or impractical. Thus, we must look for alternative strategies that allow for causal identification when we do not have control over treatment assignment. In this course, we will explore the five most common methods to identify causal effects in observational data. This includes controlled regression, matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and differences-in-differences. The aim is to help you to understand modern applied econometric methods and to foster the skills needed to plan and conduct your own data science projects. Course prerequisites: Students should have completed at least one undergraduate statistics class at the level of Stats 250. Please note by completing the Statistics Entrance assessment, you have waived this prerequisite. This course was initially developed by Dr. Alain Cohn. The syllabus and course design are thanks to his hard work and expertise.",

The practice quiz will be exactly the same as the real quiz except for two things: (a) your score on the practice quiz does not count towards your final grade, but your score on the real quiz does, and (b) the feedback you receive after you submit a practice quiz is \"limited\" (i.e. you will learn which questions you answered correctly and which ones you answered incorrectly), but the feedback you receive after you submit a real quiz is \"full\" (i.e. in addition to the limited feedback, you will receive an explanation about why the correct answer is the correct answer). For each real quiz, you only get one attempt . If your submission for a real quiz is made between 0-24h after the deadline will receive a 15% late penalty.

For any attempt made 72h or more after the deadline, a 100% late penalty will be applied to the entire attempt.\n\nYour official grade on the assignment will be the maximum of the grades on your attempts of the assignment. For example, if you attempt an assignment four times and receive the grades 50, 75, 80, 85 (100 with a 15% late penalty), then your official grade on the assignment would be 85. For another example, if you attempt an assignment five times and receive the grades 20, 50, 87, 76.5 (90 with a 15% late penalty), and 70 (100 with a 30%) late penalty, then your official grade on the assignment would be 87.\n\nEach student starts the course with one \"free pass,\" which allows them to choose one week of the course (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, or Week 4) and extend the deadlines for all of that week's assessment by three days (72 hours).

  "Information Visualization II (SIADS 622), Course Syllabus For SIADS 622:Information Visualization II Course Overview And Prerequisites: This course extends our understanding of information visualization. Leveraging the topics covered in Information Visualization I, we introduce interactive techniques that can be used broadly for visualization. The course will also introduce techniques for visualizing specific data types: temporal, network, hierarchical, and text.\n\nInformation visualization is a crucial step in both understanding and communicating data. In the first Information Visualization course we focused on the fundamental principles behind visualization--the most basic types of data, encodings, and the perceptual and cognitive processes that make some visualizations better than others. This class will expand on these basic principles to include interactivity. We will see how interactivity can act as a boost to expressiveness and effectiveness by studying a handful of common cross-cutting techniques. The class will also expand on the basic data types to feature techniques for visualizing multivariate datasets, temporal data, network, hierarchical, and text. We will focus on general techniques but also focus on specific real-world case studies for each type. Beyond the theoretical, the course will allow students to build on their Altair expertise to build more sophisticated and interactive visualizations.

  "Presenting Uncertainty (SIADS 524), SIADS 524: Presenting Uncertainty Course Syllabus Course Overview And Prerequisites: This course covers strategies and techniques for effective uncertainty visualization. Uncertainty communication is essential for data analysts to learn, both to better understand their data and to effectively communicate the implications of data and models to others. This class covers a wide variety of uncertainty visualization techniques, including continuous uncertainty encodings, intervals, and frequency-framing approaches. Students will learn how each technique impacts people's ability to perceive and reason about uncertainty and what biases and pitfalls to be wary of when communicating uncertainty. Uncertainty visualization techniques are placed into a coherent theoretical foundation, the Grammar of Graphics, and programming exercises are conducted in a Grammar of Graphics-based API, Altair. Finally, as it is crucial to accurately represent the limits of our knowledge, strategies for dealing with large-world uncertainty (communicating uncertainty about model specifications themselves) will be discussed throughout.",

  "Milestone I (SIADS 593), 10.1 Collaboration: UMSI strongly encourages collaboration while working on some assignments, such as homework problems and interpreting reading assignments as a general practice. Active learning is effective. Collaboration with other students in the course will be especially valuable in summarizing the reading materials and picking out the key concepts. You must, however, write your homework submission on your own, in your own words, before turning it in. If you worked with someone on the homework before writing it, you must list any and all collaborators on your written submission. Each course and each instructor may place restrictions on collaboration for any or all assignments. Read the instructions carefully and request clarification about collaboration when in doubt. Collaboration is almost always forbidden for take-home and in class exams.\n\nIf you are a more advanced student and are willing to help other students, please feel free to do so. Just remember that your goal is to help teach the material to the student receiving the help and not do their work for them.",
  "Milestone I (SIADS 593), 10.2 Plagiarism: All written submissions must be your own, original work. Original work for narrative questions is not mere paraphrasing of someone else's completed answer: you must not share written answers with each other at all. At most, you should be working from notes you took while participating in a study session. Largely duplicate copies of the same assignment will receive an equal division of the total point score from the one piece of work. You may incorporate selected excerpts, statements or phrases from publications by other authors, but they must be clearly marked as quotations and must be attributed. If you build on the ideas of prior authors, you must cite their work. You may obtain copy editing assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others, but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own, or be explicitly attributed to another. See the (Doctoral, MSI, BSI) student handbooks available on the UMSI intranet for the definition of plagiarism, resources to help you avoid it, and the consequences for intentional or unintentional plagiarism.",
  "Milestone I (SIADS 593), 10.3 Generative Artificial Intelligence: Emerging generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools provide news ways to learn and master computational thinking and creative programming. Using generative AI to complete SIADS 593 assignments is permitted, unless expressly prohibited by the assignment instructions. If you utilize generative AI to generate assignment code you _must_ cite the tool(s), prompts, and outputs employed to complete the assignment. If you fail to disclose your use of generative AI you will receive a score of zero (0) for the assignment. Repeated use without disclosure will be reported to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.",
  "Milestone I (SIADS 593), 10.3 Generative Artificial Intelligence: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, UM-GPT, and Github Copilot can increase productivity and accelerate software development. But downsides exist and you _must_ exercise caution when leveraging AI in your work. AI tools are imperfect and can produce content that is inappropriate, offensive, or otherwise problematic. AI tools can produce code that is inelegant, inefficient, insecure, unreliable, unreadable, and/or unmaintainable. Within a classroom context, AI tools can produce code that performs the desired computation but nevertheless fails to meet the requirements of an assignment problem. You are responsible for the code you submit. If you are unfamiliar with the syntax, structure, and/or semantics of AI-generated code _do not_ include the code in your assignment solution. If you cannot explain to your instructor the computations that AI-generated code performs _do not_ include the code in your assignment solution. You do yourself no favors by submitting code that you do not understand. In the end, however, you need to decide on the degree to which you use generative AI. Do you want to be the sort of data scientist who merely repeats what others have done, or do you want to be one who contributes to the future work of other data scientists? This is not a black-and-white distinction and we encourage you to use generative AI when appropriate, but consider lessening your reliance on the technology as you gain experience with data science tools.",

  "Milestone I (SIADS 593), 17.0 Religious Holidays: Although the University of Michigan, as an institution, does not observe religious holidays, it has long been the University's policy that every reasonable effort should be made to help students avoid negative academic consequences when their religious obligations conflict with academic requirements. Absence from classes or examinations for religious reasons does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence. Students who expect to miss classes, examinations, or other assignments as a consequence of their religious observance shall be provided with a reasonable alternative opportunity to complete such academic responsibilities. It is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious holidays on which they will be absent. Such notice must be given by the drop/add deadline of the given term. Students who are absent on days of examinations or class assignments shall be offered an opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, unless it can be demonstrated that a make-up opportunity would interfere unreasonably with the delivery of the course. Should disagreement arise over any aspect of this policy, the parties involved should contact the Department Chair, the Dean of the School, or the Ombudsperson. Final appeals will be resolved by the Provost. The Office of the Provost maintains a list of religious holidays that may pose a conflict with the academic calendar.",
  "Milestone I (SIADS 593), 18.0 Technology Tips: We will be using Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, and Google Sheets to facilitate communication.

  "Social Media Analytics (SIADS 682), Programming Lab: There is a lightly graded Programming Lab in this course that will require students to gain access to the an API of a social media platform, which requiring a developer account. The instructions for gaining this access are detail in the Lab.\n\nWhy is this Lab about Reddit when the other assignments are about Twitter? Your weekly coding assignments deal with archived Twitter data, and we used to have a Twitter Lab to complement that. But, there have been a lot of changes (and mixed signals) surrounding free access to Twitter developer accounts in recent months. Perhaps Twitter will reverse itself again, but upon recent testing we were no longer able to access a free tier that accommodate our needs, so we looked for an alternative. This Lab as an alternative way to give you some \"real world\" experience accessing data from a different social media platform, Reddit.\n\nImportant: Gaining access to a developer account in Reddit can take minutes to days -- if you plan to do the assignment in this class, please request this as early as possible to ensure you have appropriate time to complete your assignment.",

Everyone in the class is expected to have read the required readings for that week's topic. If you do not do the required readings, your understanding of the course material will suffer, as will your grade. Our engagement with these readings will take place in the form of written reading reflections that you submit to the instructors. We will engage in four ways:\n\nDescription: statements or questions about what the author claims.\nCritique: arguments about whether the author is correct or what the author has left out.\nConnection: how the claims or concepts relate to those in other readings.\nApplication: how the reading applies to current events or platform issues.\n\nYou will apply these techniques in your reading reflection, in the form of responding to one or more of a few prompts provided by the instructor. The goal of the reading reflection is to engage more deeply with the readings. A rubric is provided in Coursera to guide you in constructing your week's written response.\n\nYou are required to post your reading reflection\u2014in plain text\u2014to the appropriate pinned Slack thread for that week's reading. You can also receive 0.5% extra credit for replying to another student's reading reflection in that thread with a thoughtful comment.",

  "Supervised Learning (SIADS 542), Grading And Course Checklist: I anticipate no major changes to this course grading scheme. However, as the course progresses, I reserve the right to offer additional bonus assessments or make minor adjustments/fixes as required, for any evaluation method in this course. If necessary, any such changes will always be done in a way that maximizes a student's grade across options.\n\nGiven the highly interdependent nature of MADS courses, it is essential that you properly cover all the topics in this course, each of which is important. Thus, you must \"pass\" ALL Assignments AND Quizzes to receive credit for this course. What does this mean? You \"pass\" an assignment or quiz by getting a minimum grade of 80% regardless of whatever late penalty might also apply. If by the end of the course you have any assignments or quizzes that you did not \"pass\", you will be given a course grade of \"incomplete\" until you submit those remaining assignments or quizzes to the level of a \"pass\".",
  "Supervised Learning (SIADS 542), Grading And Course Checklist: Example: You hand in Assignment 3 but only get a grade of 60%, which is less than 80% and thus not a \"pass\". You continue in the course, and to meet the above \"pass\" course requirement, a week later you finish the questions and achieve a score of 90% (ignoring late penalty) for Assignment 3. Thus, you now have a \"pass\" for Assignment 3. Your actual grade for Assignment 3 will be evaluated by the normal grading / late penalty scheme. In this case, it will be 60% (the maximum of your submission grades with late penalty included), not the 90% grade used to satisfy the \"pass\" criterion (which ignores the late penalty).\n\n| Course Item                                        | Percentage of Final Grade | Passing Threshold |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| Week 1 Quiz                                        | 5%                        | 80%               |\n| Week 1 Jupyter Notebook Assignments (Part 1 and 2) | 15%                       | 80%               |\n| Week 2 Quiz                                        | 5%                        | 80%               |\n| Week 2 Jupyter Notebook Assignment                 | 20%                       | 80%               |\n| Week 3 Quiz                                        | 5%                        | 80%               |\n| Week 3 Jupyter Notebook Assignment                 | 20%                       | 80%               |",

  "Supervised Learning (SIADS 542), Late Submission Policy: Important! Please read and understand this section, and if anything is unclear, the instructors are happy to clarify. We realize that, now more than ever, the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra time in completing a course assignment or quiz. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy that gives you a limited number of flexible \"late day\" credits.\n\nYou have a total of two (2) free late days to use during the course. One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. As an example, suppose you had two course late days left. Submitting any time within 24hrs of the original due date counts as using the first late day. Beyond that time, submitting any time within the next 24h counts as using the 2nd late day. After that, each additional 24h period accrues a 25% per day penalty as follows:\n\nOnce you have used up your late days, there is a 25% penalty for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late. For example , if the due date is 11:59 p.m. ET, Monday, and you have _no_ late days left, penalties would be:\n\n- Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Tuesday: 25% deduction\n- Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday: 50% deduction\n- Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 75% deduction\n- Submit after 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 100% deduction",
  "Supervised Learning (SIADS 542), Late Submission Policy: If you were to have one late day at the end of the term the submission policy would be as follows:\n\n- Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday: 25% deduction\n- Submit before 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday: 50% deduction\n\n  ... and so on as above.\n\nImportant: You do not need to explain or get permission to use late days. If you choose/need to use the available late days for a week's work, you will be responsible for designating which week(s) you wish to have the late day(s) applied. Your choice could impact your final course grade due to the assignment weighting described in the Grading and Course Checklist section above. Upon completion of all assignments, please Slack DM the course Instructor and Lecturer (s)(combined message) with your desired application of late days. Note that any submissions after the weekly deadline may be counted as a late submission for the week. This late policy applies to both assignments and quizzes.",
  "Supervised Learning (SIADS 542), Late Submission Policy: Very Important: If you intend to work on and submit an assignment after the official last day of the course (e.g. you use late days to complete a week 4 assignment past the deadline), you must make sure to start your work early enough that any assistance you might need from the instructional team can be obtained no later than the last official day of the course (i.e. stated close of the session). There is no guarantee that assistance from instructional staff will still be available after the last day of the course, since their time will already be occupied preparing for the next session's courses.\n\nPlease note: Submitting your work on time is very important in this course. Do not leave the assignments for the last minute.

MADS students will know ahead of time when a test is proctored, and will have the opportunity to schedule proctoring at a time that is convenient for them.",
  "Academic and Professional Integrity > Understanding Plagiarism: At the University of Michigan, plagiarism (for example, using the writings or ideas of another without proper attribution) is considered a serious academic offense. Penalties for violators of academic policy regarding plagiarism range from loss of a grade to expulsion from the University. It is the responsibility of each student to understand what plagiarism is and the consequences of committing plagiarism, whether intentional or unintentional. There is a comprehensive overview of what constitutes plagiarism, especially as it relates to computer programming, in this Orientation. The University Library also offers[ information about plagiarism](https://www.lib.umich.edu/academic-integrity/understanding-plagiarism) and how you can protect yourself. Also see the \u201c[Policy Statement on the Integrity of Scholarship](https://research-compliance.umich.edu/research-integrity)\u201d on the U-M Research website. MADS students, as they complete their degree on Coursera, are required to uphold the[ Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) which includes registering for only one account, using your own work for homework, quizzes, and exams except when explicit permission is given to collaborate, not sharing solutions with others unless given explicit permission by the instructor, and not engaging in activities that will dishonestly improve or damage your results or the results of others. If a MADS student violates the Coursera Honor Code in a Coursera learning opportunity (MOOC, degree course, etc.) this is considered a violation of the UMSI MADS academic and professional integrity policy as well.",
  "Academic and Professional Integrity > The Roles and Responsibilities of Students: A clear sense of academic honesty and responsibility is fundamental to our scholarly community. To that end, UMSI and the University of Michigan expect their students to demonstrate honesty and integrity in all their academic activities. As professionals in training, students assume various roles depending on their coursework and activities. These include the roles of scholar/researcher, teacher, supervisor of employees, representative to the public (of the University, the discipline and/or the profession), and professional colleague and even the role of provider of services to clients. Therefore, students are responsible for maintaining high standards of conduct while engaged in coursework, research or thesis preparation, and other activities related to academics and their profession. Because students take on multiple roles in multiple settings, some types of conduct are both academic and professional in nature; hence, the inclusive nature of this policy. Educational training, like future professional life, includes demands that might tempt some students to violate integrity standards. There are pressures on students to achieve high grades, obtain financial support, meet research or publication deadlines, gain recognition from the scholarly community, and secure employment. Although faculty members can help students to maintain academic integrity despite these pressures, each student has final responsibility for maintaining integrity in their individual conduct. Finally, conduct that violates the ethical or legal standards of the University community or of UMSI may result in serious consequences, including immediate disciplinary action and future professional disrepute. In support of UMSI\u2019s commitment to maintain high standards of integrity, this policy makes provisions for bringing forward and hearing cases of academic and professional misconduct.",
  "Academic and Professional Integrity > The Role of the UMSI Faculty and Others in the University Community: The UMSI faculty is accountable for maintaining high standards of academic and professional integrity and for serving as models in this regard. Many of the same policies and codes of conduct that apply to students also apply to faculty.\n\nSince each of the roles played by a student carries with it some measure of public trust, the awarding of a university degree confers on its recipients some assurance of the individual\u2019s suitability to bear that trust. Therefore, faculty and administrators associated with students\u2019 education, both at the unit and central levels of the University, must hold students accountable according to these standards. Toward this end and taking into account the pressures on students that may lead to misconduct, faculty members are responsible for educating and mentoring students on matters of integrity and for monitoring students\u2019 actions in this regard. Attention to matters of integrity should be given in both courses and research settings. Such guidance is particularly important for students as they assume independent roles as course assistants or begin to conduct their own original work. Traits that should be fostered are those that are common to all scholarship and also those that are unique to a particular specialization.",
  "Academic and Professional Integrity > Forms of Academic and Professional Misconduct > Forms of Academic Misconduct: Offenses against the standards of academic integrity include the following:\n\n- Cheating\n- Plagiarism and other misappropriation of the work of another\n- Falsification of data\n- Improperly obtaining or representing laboratory or field data\n- Dishonesty in publication\n- Publication or attempted publication of collaborative work without the permission of the other participants\n- Abuse of confidentiality\n- Misuse of computer facilities\n- Misuse of human subjects\n- Falsification or unauthorized modification of an academic record\n- Obstruction of the academic activities of another\n- Other forms of academic misconduct that are commonly accepted within the scientific community\n- Aiding or abetting academic misconduct\n- Attempted academic misconduct",
  "Academic and Professional Integrity > Forms of Academic and Professional Misconduct > Forms of Professional Misconduct: Professional misconduct is behavior that is inconsistent with ethical standards in any of the professional roles for which the student is being trained that is not covered by policies governing academic integrity. This may include the student\u2019s performance in the role of researcher or scholar, teacher or mentor, supervisor, service-provider or colleague. Of particular note in this regard are behaviors that make the workplace hostile for colleagues, supervisors or subordinates. UMSI students are expected to adhere to ethical standards in a variety of work settings (e.g., offices, classrooms, and laboratories) within the explicit standards set by University policies. Language or behavior that is threatening, disruptive, abusive or hostile can make the workplace so unsafe or unpleasant that others cannot do their work. However, graduate education must take place in an environment in which free expression, free inquiry, intellectual honesty, and respect for the rights and dignity of others can be expected. Ethical standards of conduct should help ensure, not compromise, these features of the University environment. Sources of the norms or standards to which students can be held accountable (and charged under this policy if they fail to adhere to them) are as follows:\n\nState and Federal Laws: Students, like all members of the University community, are expected to abide by all State and Federal laws.",

Please note that with the exception of the two policies that are specific to students (the final two policies on the list below), these standards apply to faculty as well as to graduate students.\n\n- The Sexual Harassment Policy for Faculty and Staff (Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action).\n- The Regents\u2019 Bylaw on Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action.\n- The Policy Statement on the Integrity of Scholarship and Procedures for Investigating Allegations of Misconduct in the Pursuit of Scholarship and Research, which applies to all instructional faculties and others in the institution as specified in the document.\n- The Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities.\n- The Student Policy on Alcohol and Other Drugs.\n\nThe text of these policies can be found on the U-M website.

UMSI faculty and graduate students share responsibility in this regard. Faculty should make such policies available to students, and, in turn, students should take the initiative to familiarize themselves with such codes of conduct or ethics.\n\nAdditional : In addition, students can be held accountable for the following professionally relevant behaviors, which may or may not be identified as violations in other formal codes of conduct relevant to the student.

For any other event or services offered by UMSI for which you need accommodations, submit your request to the appropriate staff member at least two weeks in advance or at the time you register or RSVP if applicable.\n4. Because the decision to request reasonable accommodations due to a disability is a matter of individual choice, students have the responsibility to request reasonable accommodations in a timely manner. As a result, we do not assume that an accommodation provided in one course is appropriate or desired in another situation. Similarly, UMSI treats such requests in as confidential a manner as possible. Therefore, do not assume that because one faculty or staff member is aware of your need for an accommodation that others are also aware. You should request a reasonable accommodation each time you determine that one is needed.",
  "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Policy: 5. If you are working with fellow students in group projects or research, it is your choice to disclose your disability and/or to describe needs you may have for completing work as a team. Every student will have their own strengths and challenges, but if you have a disability that may impact your ability to work effectively on a team, discussing this up front and coming up with creative strategies can be important to your success and the success of the group.",
  "UMSI Student Parental Accommodation Policy: The Student Parental Accommodation Policy assists graduate students immediately following the birth or adoption of a young child. The purpose of this policy is to make it possible for a student to maintain registered full time student status, along with all the benefits of such status, while facilitating the return to full participation in courses, research and teaching.\n\nThe policy applies to full time, enrolled students who are in good academic standing, and making satisfactory progress toward completion of their degree. Students must have completed at least one full time semester of their degree program to become eligible for coverage under this policy. The policy covers the situation of students who experience childbirth or the adoption of a child under the age of 6 for whom the student has parental responsibilities. These eligibility requirements cover all three provisions of the policy.\n\nThe three primary accommodations available are:\n\n1. Eligible students are entitled to an extension of one year per childbirth or adoption to the 5-year maximum time to degree policy. UMSI must approve requests for extension of time limits.",
  "UMSI Student Parental Accommodation Policy: 2. All eligible students will be granted a Parental Accommodation period up to six weeks long immediately following the birth of a child or the adoption of a child under the age of 6 for whom the student has parental responsibilities. During this period of accommodation, the student will continue to be enrolled as a full time student. Because the student remains enrolled as a full time student and continues to pay tuition, this is not a leave of absence. It is instead a modification of deadlines and academic expectations to accommodate the student\u2019s new parental responsibilities. Students are expected to work with faculty and staff in advance of their leave to develop a workable plan.\n3. Students in GSRA positions are eligible to continue in their positions with funding and to have modified schedules and the stated 6 weeks leave time upon birth of a child or adoption of a child. The terms of employment for students with GSI or GSSA appointments are covered by the contract between the University and the Graduate Employees Organization. The provisions of the contract will govern stipend and benefits for these students. Students receiving fellowship or scholarship funds will remain enrolled and as such these funds will not be impacted.",

While there are various ways to define \u201cprofessional,\u201d we expect that members of our community will respectfully engage one another. The professional and personal relationships you make here may last well beyond your participation in the MADS program.\n- **UMSI faculty and staff will generally share how they prefer to use Slack**. If a UMSI faculty or staff prefers not to respond to DMs, they will let students know. Students, in turn, should not expect UMSI faculty and staff to respond to DMs or mentions (@) if they have indicated they do not use Slack in this way.\n- **Group DMs will be utilized if instructional teams require it**. Please remember to DM an entire instructional team if they\u2019ve asked students to engage with them this way. If a student DMs a single instructional team member, that member may add other team members to the conversation.\n- **Private conversations (in DMs) should remain private**.

Be sure to post your question in the appropriate homework pinned thread (typically set up by the instructional team on the first day of the course). For example, if you had a question about how to approach the first assignment, you would start the message with [Assignment 1], or if you had a query about question two from the third homework, you would start the message with [HW3 Q2].\n\nHow you refer to the homework depends on what it is called in the course and how others refer to it.
