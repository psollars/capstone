        "Math Methods I (SIADS 502), Course Syllabus Mads 502: Math Methods For Data Science Course Overview: There are no prerequisites for this course. This course will review and introduce some mathematical concepts relevant to applied data science. It will cover important concepts in linear algebra, probability, and statistics. Week 1 covers some math basics about sets, types of numbers, types of proofs, functions, derivatives, optimization, exponents, logarithms, Euler's number, and natural logarithms. It also covers Part 1 of the unit on Linear Algebra, specifically vector operations with math and with Python and the concepts of span, basis, and linear independence. Week 2 is Part 2 of the unit on Linear Algebra. It covers matrix operations with math and with Python, the concept of matrices as linear mappings, determinants, traces, and some basics about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Week 3 is the unit on Probability. It covers the concepts of random variables, introduces some important discrete and continuous distributions, expectation, variance, conditional probability, independence, Bayes' rule, and Monte Carlo simulations. Week 4 is the unit on Statistics. It covers the Central Limit Theorem, hypothesis testing, some math and interpretation of OLS regressions and logistic regressions, and a little bit about maximum likelihood. Instructor and Teaching Staff Instructor: Alex McLeod (mcleodal@umich.edu) Assisting Instructors: Saurabh Budholiya (srbh@umich.edu), Alexis Castellanos (acastel@umich.edu)",
        "Math Methods I (SIADS 502), Course Schedule: - This course starts Tuesday, August 29th and ends Monday, September 25th\n- Weekly assignments are due on Mondays at 11:59 pm EDT (Eastern Daylight Time)\n- Schedule of Weekly Office Hours via Zoom: - Alex McLeod: Monday at 11:45 am EST - Saurabh Budholiya: Friday at 9:00 am EST - Alexis Castellano: Thursdays at 7:00 pm EST",
        "Math Methods I (SIADS 502), Communication Expectations: - Most questions about the lectures and the assignments should be posted on the Slack channel for the course, so that other students can see the questions, offer their answers and ideas, and see the final answers. Please do not post code related to specific assignment questions (see below).\n- If your question is about your specific code for an assignment question, please send a Slack please send one Slack direct message to all of the teaching staff at once. Make sure to include (a) the assignment number and the question number that your question is about, (b) a clean, minimal version of your attempted code, (c) the output of your code, (d) the error message if any, and (e) a short explanation of what your approach to the problem has been.\n- Typically instructors will respond to a Slack post or direct message within 24 hours. If you have not received a response in 48 hours, please resend."
